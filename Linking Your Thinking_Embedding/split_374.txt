question for the philosophy of biology how do you define that generally speaking though this is going to be an issue about social theory and ethics so if you want to load the domain graph there is in the search bar you can just select a domain but in this case just double click on this now we're coming to the other part of the site and this is a network graph of every article that has been tagged with social and political philosophy and when the graph loads there's no labels on the nodes because that was going to be too cognitively dissonant to make all that stuff but this is showing you something from right here you can look at the size of each particular node is going to correspond to the number of links within that particular domain that article shares so these nodes that have the biggest circles this is going to be a major central point of this domain now when i mouse out there now this guy up here this is there's no other links it's a smaller circle because it's at the periphery of this domain so just by looking at the main graph you get some sense of the structure now over here on the right though you're going to see all right there's 291 articles that are tagged with social and political philosophy now that's going to be both as its primary domain and its secondary domain so you'll then be able to see from in from this list that there are different colors have different primary domains but these domains link these are fluid boundaries so you'll see then the top five now this is going to be the top five articles in the domain in terms of where they sit within directio
