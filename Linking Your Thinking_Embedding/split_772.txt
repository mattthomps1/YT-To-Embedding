 presentation right presentations you don't usually like reference things so heavily but there were things that i remembered that i had read or influenced me and i basically pulled them together even books that i had read so there was like literally things i had read over years or like stories i had heard about like the apple newton so there were things that i sort of like put together this narrative in my own head and and sort of wrote it and then val did it that i was like actually right by going and finding the right things i was thinking of or doing some new research but i wasn't i think the benefit here and this is still with this tension is i wasn't worried about going and finding all these sources and then making like an obsidian note documenting that i know this piece of thing exists i like wrote the thing and then i hyperlinked it all together which isn't maybe the most rigorous academic way to do it per se but i think the challenge right as soon as it happens and i think nick has been warning about this a lot is like as soon as you have the ability to put it all in obsidian it becomes it can become overwhelming so i tend not i never make i never will do something like this oh i'm just like oh i want to come back and make that a thing i will never do that if i'm not ready to write something about it i don't want it to be a thing i don't want there to be any noise about like things where i like want to tag it i i found that obsidian search works well enough where i i never need to like treat these as tags if it's not something i really want to put knowledge into i d
