e the story and the cool nerdy facts about chestnut trees and you know weird folklore any of us will be interested in chestnuts guarantee you but no but more to your point there is something fascinating about our interest like art used to just be this finalized product um and you just look at it like a painting but now it's like the story behind the story the behind the scenes how it was done all these things give us this uh i'm going to use it again that word umami um to kind of give us this fuller experience and um i think you know it's a shared human experience behind the scenes counts too so that's kind of cool that you're doing this this is the child note for see i i was literally working on this last night so i didn't finish doing the breadcrumb stuff so this is how the breadcrumb thing works you give it you tell it whether something is a parent sibling or child and this is the child note for the cat and wolf story right i wrote it after i finished the story so theoretically um maybe i messed something up i haven't used this much don't yeah don't judge me but i'm very excited about it field name it says child oh maybe because it's capital yama's real finicky i don't know i figured out later but the general idea is that now i'm able to better keep track of like what things go with what so there we go okay so it's for some reason an implied connection instead of uh probably because it's not actually physically in this yaml so it'll pick up the stuff it's like backlinks but more targeted does that make sense a little i was just expecting it to say parent and then boom bu
