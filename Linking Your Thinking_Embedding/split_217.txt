cepts assuming that you've downloaded this kit then you'll have access to a series of instructional videos that dive a little bit deeper into the folder structure over here and a lot of the other interesting and powerful aspects of the light kit for now broad overview another aspect is when it's not just about ideas but a lot of people also want to manage their efforts their productivity well what does that look like so here is a way that you can manage your projects and other aspects of your work and life spaces next on the docket if we go a little bit further down we have ways to manage our knowledge there's a lot here i'll cover that in a different video and last so important to include this the fourth area to always focus on is the uniquely human wondrous joy of thinking itself so let me just jump into this thinking note and the reason i want to show you this particular note is because you'll notice a lot of links that are not included a lot of notes that are not included and that's because of something else that's pretty cool with linked knowledge this whole light kit 300 notes it's just a tiny folder in which it it lives within my bigger collection of my personal knowledge so i'm just sharing this folder with you and in my bigger folder it has links to all these other notes that are grayed out and so at the top there's this little thing called the call out if you click on that it'll explain what you can expect in that particular note so this is a sanitized version of my actual note where content and links have been removed so that is just something to take note of now
