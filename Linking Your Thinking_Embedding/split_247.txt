 i tried to leave myself this metadata these bread problems of hey my plan is to use this as twitter and i have a tag for that for supporting and kind of like raising awareness that hey i have this little note or i have this newsletter check it out hey eleanor um i for some reason well good question is your audio is cracky so i'm curious if my audios crack correctly as well so anyone in the comment can let us know real fast um it's flickering a bit yeah is is my audio as well if anyone in the chat can let us know um okay so it might be on your end internet connection wise yeah we did a tech check i promise but maybe yeah because we did it we did it tech check so apologies for that i'm gonna ask my husband to get off the wi-fi yeah yeah tell him tell him to get off sorry guys okay no worries in the meantime everyone let's look on the screen real fast because what i'm curious there are a couple things happening on that far left note which is the the link to cuisine and then they're the broader and broader that might take us down the breadcrumbs rabbit hole so maybe we stay away from that but i am essentially i was curious because you went to cuisine when i thought you were going to link outward to pangolins like there was a choice i think at one point because you started with this random note people are not or not pangolins are this traditional cuisine so i was thinking you were going to go into the land of pangolins and maybe like accumulate knowledge around that or something but instead you ended up going to cuisine and i can't i'm just kind of curious where we go from here
