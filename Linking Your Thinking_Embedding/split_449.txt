u know dependability and i i really like where read wise has been where it's going and so i feel very good about using this and it's now a part of my workflow since it's so new i haven't really used it um excessively and also because we're getting ready for a few other things so i haven't been reading quite as much lately but it is pretty freaking awesome so this is this is lovely and i think we're about ready then to open it up for q a i'm going to start with luke's question here what plugin is daniel using to highlight website articles is that the read wise plugin or a third party oh good question so this is a read-wise browser extension we haven't actually gone live with this it's um still in development but uh if you email hello rewise.io aaron and i will see that and we can set you up with the beta version but you could be using hypothesis here you could be using any of the other extensions we're integrated with if you prefer the cool thing about hours is that you can highlight images so this image is highlighted with this text so if i run this sync this might take a second i keep forgetting the name of this metaverse article here it is if we give this a second it should come in and it'll have the image you probably also notice like here it's got the italics and here it's also got the hyperlink that was contained within this highlight so we're the only highlighting tool i know of that's preserving formatting and taking taking images in oh yeah here you can see the image um wow this is a little janky but why did it do that i think it probably just smashed um here we go
