the thing about apps like obsidian is that you've been handed the keys to a state-of-the-art hovercraft and with great power comes great responsibility we can get lost once we start looking into the settings there are so many things we can do so you have to ask yourself why like why enable start files why enable page preview now is it because you don't want to forget a certain file then yeah do the start file that's an easy one but as you start looking at these settings they're very intimidating because there's so much that you can do we have to keep in mind gold's law which is simply this any complex system was created from a bunch of simple systems that have stood the test of time you can't create complex systems from scratch and hope that they'll work they're fragile they'll break because they're not tested they're not forged through actual use so the same thing applies once we start thinking in terms of structure even though right now we're just talking about settings less is more we grow as we go so let's keep that in mind let's dive in so picking up from where we left off let's make a new note and i'm going to paste in the next lesson the eight most important settings in obsidian obsidian is full of so many settings so just choosing eight was kind of a difficult thing to do but we're going to keep it simple and we're going to find out hey we don't have to touch those other settings and everything just works so first let's explore a little bit we're going to go to this cog icon which is the settings and open up this pop-up window now exit out of there by clicking away
