o a table of content to an moc a hub note um quite independently um the light kit ended up having something similar because i think i started to wonder well how can i provide somebody a soft landing point you know like somewhere where they can get a sense of their bearings uh without being overwhelmed and you know so so i think what you do it really does that on a very high level and then when they're ready they can jump in and see like okay now we're here and and then how you have your categories laid out pretty naturally at the start right we kind of have these there's a sense of um chronology we go preface introduction and then we go kind of more topically and maybe that is still um in the path that is chronological or maybe not you know at this point you would be the one who knows best but it's it's just really nice to see another thing i'd like to also say is i love how you're going from you know this is your to-do and it's all sort of in front of you and then as things get tightened they become just the link and it's just a very it's i mean the things that you're doing here i find that i jive almost 100 percent with you know how i've been working as well and it's it's just kind of great to see this inspiration thanks yeah appreciate that um yeah as you're seeing it it is sort of that chronology um and some of these things i'm not sure yet if they'll they'll live on and i sort of get stronger again at the end here um but for example um why website matters or embracing everything should be a remix or how long should knowledge last actually have nothing to do with this p
