ally quickly let's imagine i was on note star and i wanted to get back to the topic for this conversation then i just click back to our note cool right i like to stay on file explorer on the side and that's halfway through so let's go now to the next part of the settings just file and deleted files so it's important that we decide where we want to keep our files now for me i kind of like to keep it in the system trash and what that means is it's your computer your file system's trash let's explore that really fast let's say i create a new note and i title it nonsense i don't want to keep it so i right click and i'll hit delete and i'll confirm that it's deleted so where did it go it actually just went to the max trash folder and here it is so that's what i would prefer that you do then you always know where deleted notes go and you want them to go somewhere you're familiar with all right going on the next one this is bolded because out of everything in the settings i find this to be the most important one especially once you start linking and changing the names of the files that you link to you want them to always update turn this on so now that means see this note never note it's linked to note star right so what if we change note star to note star 2 i click away it gives me this up here updated three links in one file so now i'm going to go to never note and check this out never note has updated note star 2. that means that when i command click on it it takes me to note star so that is so crucial this is the most important setting in anything that you do with obsidian tur
