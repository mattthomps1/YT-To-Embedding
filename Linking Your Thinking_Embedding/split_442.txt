xport my books or only export my tweets what have you and that's that's also on the roadmap that's pretty cool yeah i mean so just to quickly walk through the other template options here this one right here highlight this is probably the the meatiest one this controls what individual highlights look like when they're exported so here you can see that i've exported this as a block quote in obsidian you need to have a new line between block block quotes otherwise they smash together um you can see that i'm also exporting this link at the end for view view highlight to go back to the original you can see that that's kind of embedded in here with the highlight location um so that's what this highlight thing is modifying also if i had notes or tags let me go over to how to take experiments um if i have highlights or tags for me i export those as a sub bullets you know tags colon and then the note uh the the tags themselves in wikilink format some people will swap that to be a hashtag and then my note that i took while i was reading it below um so that's what this one is controlling uh we talked about the yaml front matter at the very beginning even though this comes low in the template just because it's by default disabled this obviously will be the front matter at the top of the markdown file and then this final one is called sync notification this is much more relevant in rome which you know by default embeds linked references onto pages a little bit more aggressively than what obsidian does where it's kind of relegated to a side panel but this this will populate a file um whi
