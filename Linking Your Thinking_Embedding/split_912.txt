will   quote it here so i always remember that so that's 
how i make sure to do the attributions properly   i'm not as rigorous about the attributions as 
a true academic that's me personally but you   can be there's nothing preventing you from 
being that level of rigor i always want to   make sure i attribute ideas to the right person 
however because that's just the right thing to do   but let's say i'm here here's a good example back 
to the concepts map and then i'm looking in linked   mentions and oh what's this concept expansion 
click on that here we are and then i'm like oh   let's go back to the quote literature note and 
then i'm back to the literature now so i hope   i hope that help answered your question answer 
your question david about uh literature notes   and and and by the way none of that used a 
map so that's just you know bottom up working how is light compared to para or other pkm methods i'll be careful with this one   i would say at the at the heart of it all is 
light is flexible and you customize your system   para depends on four folders and it seems like 
every other comment in the world of linking   with obsidian and rome is they they'll say 
something like well i use para but i don't use   the a or you know i kind of blend this and that 
so if it's helpful for you do that um i think   when you change your your mindset from folders 
to links uh para kind of loses a lot of its value   this is another valuable note 
though there are uses for para   people are using para in or pera i don't know 
in obsidian quite effectively uh one of the mods   o
