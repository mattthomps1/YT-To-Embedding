ere you go civil engineering tools were useful for sailors pilots would gate the distance from land expert to taking an interpretive death much of their knowledge landmarks come from inshore fisherfolk that seems obvious like duh i don't i don't need you to tell me that that large scale ocean sailors got their skills from practicing in like i don't need that that's obvious right i care and it's redundant this says the same thing which is like i'm not criticizing brian fagan sometimes you have to say things twice but this is the same thing as this right like we don't need to have the same thing in here three times this part's interesting pilots would gauge the distance taking and interpreting the depths local currents feel the wind that's important right like that's interesting i didn't realize that sailors would analyze how the wind feels in order to determine stuff i should have but i didn't and you know this is really two different thoughts they're both interesting but it's really two different thoughts so let's separate this out a little bit bloop isn't there a word for that something something atomic i've heard of such a term so matter for conjecture i don't care how far they went i don't really care about crete like somebody will really this is important to somebody but to me i like i'm not sitting here trying to figure out whether or not the egyptians did blah blah blah it's enough for me to say the egyptians traded with crete right like that's enough let's let's make it shorter so in these block uh block quote paraphrase areas you're doing two things one you're delet
