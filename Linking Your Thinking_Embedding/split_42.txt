et's start with Sana Sana how are you doing today I am doing great Dan thanks for the introduction um so I'm very very excited to be a part of light Workshop 10 some of you may know me because of the forest in one of Nick's case study videos if you do not know me I'm a certified brand consultant I'm also a content creator I focus on Twitter LinkedIn and Instagram but I also work with Innovative and thoughtful entrepreneurs who are ready to go all in on their Unique Edge and clarify their personal brand and grow their business with my coaching programs but I've literally did not start that way and I think light had such a huge impact in helping me with my brand the way that I do my content online and how I streamline all of it and also just my presence in general and what I talk about um so in the beginning I was creating content very haphazardly right I had also a huge fear of creating regurgitate regurgitated content like stuff that was already out there something that somebody else had said and I was worried of not adding a unique spin to things so when I got introduced to the light Frameworks and I was a part of cohort 2 it turned my brain on fire and you will probably hear some rendition of that from everybody that you meet in light Workshop 10. so what what actually happened was I was able to streamline my content systems and I was able to find a very unique way to write and create Limitless authentic content um so if you are a Creator and you want to leverage what you're doing in linking your thinking or you want to learn the fundamentals of what the top creators know
