sideration it seems like folders and mlcs can both serve as workbenches places to temporary gather notes what are the disadvantages and advantages of using one or the other so we have the option now you're right joel i find that the mlc is usually the way to go just because it's faster it's so much faster to be able to hit you know your bracket button and then start compiling notes this way um however if you really our minds still do work in in hierarchy and the folders still have value so there is a place where you might just want to keep things in a specific folder um you know habits example and to make this point clear i would put you know incubation what i'm trying to tell myself is this is temporary and you know i'm just using it for now oh sorry scrolling too quickly and i can put all this stuff in here but once i feel something is good what i would do is like uh like begets like let's check this out hey this is pretty good i'm happy with this so it was in this folder i'm just going to click and drag and plop it into the main section so you can kind of use it as an incubation chamber okay i feel a bit about this note and i can throw it out because it's i mean look it's su it's well connected it's very well connected i'm happy with it um so you know there's some options i try to avoid the folders because i find that after a while that i'm hunting for where it is i'm like is it in the habits example yet or is it and then i'm back to where i don't want to be which is like hunting and twirling down folders so you know that's that's the thing to be careful about [Music] [M
