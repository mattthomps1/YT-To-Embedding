okay let's pick up from where we left off 
and if you remember we had enabled custom css   and when we do that we have these custom themes 
buttons and we also really quickly explored   base mode changing it from dark to light so now 
we're in light mode here's kind of what the app   looks like this might be familiar to what you're 
used to when you're working with most of the   apps until recently around they've always been in 
quote light mode it was just the only mode we knew   now there's dark mode i tend to prefer it too i 
know it's trendy but it is kind of nice especially   when you're looking at the screen for long hours 
so for now we're in dark mode and let's explore   community themes so what you do is you find a 
theme you're just scrolling oh this one's new and we can click use and so now we're in 
this custom theme which is really big let me   i'll show you this hotkey later 
but you can reduce the size   on things and you can kind of see what this 
looks like um let's try a different one hopefully okay so this is a really nice theme 
that's similar to the custom theme   and it has a really cool map okay so 
these maps aren't showing up too well   if you noticed on my other screen i have this 
pretty advanced looking setup so i don't mean to   go too crazy with this but let's use it for this 
purpose so this is part of what's called the light   kit which is the linking your thinking kit and 
this is a starter kit so as you gain an experience   you might think like how do i connect everything i 
use folders do i use tags what can i use links you   know to conne
