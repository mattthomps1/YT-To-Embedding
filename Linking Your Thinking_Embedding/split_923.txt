ct these ideas over time it's easy 
when we have 50 notes but when we have 500 and we   have 5000 it's a different story so i created this 
kit to allow you to kind of figure out how that   works that'll be a different video and a whole 
different series for now though let's use it to   explore themes so this is a custom theme this is 
called cybertron which um i created and it's kind   of like futuristic and stuff you can see a little 
bit of the look so what's kind of neat here is   remember bold in this theme bold is its own 
color and you know if we wanted something to be   italicized that's its own color you can see the 
color for links if we want to click on direction   that takes us to this direction note if we click 
on four virtues that takes us to this note a   lot going on here let's not just stay on this 
theme though let's go back to that really cool   kind of obsidian alternative theme by one 
of the obsidian mods on the discord forum   actually so this is pretty cool it's clean it 
really takes advantage of that purple color and if we look at the graph view here it's 
a pretty cool looking thing and we can click   into any of these notes let's click into what 
our higher order notes and here's the structure   of a note listed now we're in edit view and 
we can see this is a title right just that   single hash we could add hashes and reduce the 
size but that's a title we'll keep it that way   something else you might have noticed 
is this thing called the local graph   so any note i click on and this is really wild 
but we can see a local graph version of it
