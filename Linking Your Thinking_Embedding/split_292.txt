ive so like the life trademark is a very fun thing that i've been working on it's like my theory on living very creative name by the way and so the mindsets one i mean that's that's what it says on the box um but it's also something like a cool little learning project that i'm working with my son on so these things something that i have to be in the mood for and i don't really know how to describe that mood but when i'm in that mood i know to go there and then the last one and this is really what i want my showcase to be about is for everything else that was not you know kind of caught above uh there's pythia and so yeah with that let's go visit her so if i don't feed my subconscious i quickly run into this sort of meaning making deficit and in my psyche that's like similar to oxygen deprivation so i'm constantly trying out new things some of which work some of which don't but i guess the process and it's just a good dose of experimentation and play that's very often the reward itself so i love clicking on things it's like the digital version of exploring someone else's ethic and i have very fond memories of that you know in real life so my intention is to create this wonderland of randomness discovery especially in this section i mean i have that elsewhere in the vault as well but everywhere else it's very cognitive whereas here it's you know all about like intuition and yeah it's just i love this place and so yeah i do a lot of thinking and creating elsewhere in the vulture so i think is like this portal into i don't know a different world like stepping through the veil t
