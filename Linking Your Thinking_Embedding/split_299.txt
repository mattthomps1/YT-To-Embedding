is is the introduction of light mode and light mode l yt stands for linking your thinking and it's intended to invoke a feeling of sense making and lateral thinking meaning you know we don't want to just write a linear list here we can but there's something about this theme that i think encourages making connections and in a linked-based note application like obsidian i really feel as though it's the peanut butter and the jelly so hopefully you get something out of this i'm just going to run through and kind of show you why i like it so much so i mean first it's gorgeous we can really zoom in and one of the big additions here is that we are using avenir next and pairing it with in monospace dm mono and the contrast between the two seemed to work quite well and in the previous theme i wasn't quite able to use true avenir next instead it was a different version with kind of a thinner more fragile font so here we're getting avenir next in its true glory and it certainly looks quite appealing we can see that there's a block quote box here where we can put content and we're keeping a vertical theme of color so this is always allowing me to know regardless if i'm taking notes from a book an article a research paper and i want to put it in quotes i become very familiar with recognizing that this is the quote box for me so as i've mentioned i do my work here i do creative analytical work here we'll skip the history for now but you can see our first link and that would take us to a different internal note and then we can see what the pop-up looks like and i can read this note right
