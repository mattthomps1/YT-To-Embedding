hese articles share links between the wickenstein main article and the russell article because this is the context that we're exploring and how russell was working and saying here you you can freeze this graph and then get a better sense if you want to see these articles or you can just unfreeze it again a single click will freeze the graph and then a single click again on the frozen node unfreeze the graph and they're back to the very beginning and you can just keep exploring all of these different things one other thing that you can see in here is up here in the default mode of the graph you have this list of articles featured on the right and what this does is this gives you an alphabetical listing of every article on the graph itself so when you can click that heading and now you have an alphabetical listing the radial graph is isn't alphabetical and i did that because i wanted to have jarring spelling differences so that you didn't get too comfortable in one particular way of going okay i'm going around the graph clockwise abc i really wanted to spur some sense of play but if you want to have that alphabetical list then you can just come over here to the list of articles and you can still mouse over and get the same subset relations but if you don't want to see that then you just double click that you single click that again that gets hidden and now you can look at the just domain list and the direction list another quick thing that you can do is that when you come over over here to the articles details button now every article you can click the article details button
