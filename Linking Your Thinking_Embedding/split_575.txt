ound up banning skywatching so and the note on the left that's the source and uh you did the magic quick add we it exploded all of the header threes into new notes but it also links back to that uh source note right yeah so um here you'll probably enjoy this graph how do i uh i like want to open it up here ah sorry hang on i'm actually really terrible at hotkeys and stuff so if i can find my they were color coded why aren't they color-coded still oh cause i changed the number i made my vault flatter my my zip my slip box i made it flatter you're slowly bringing me over into one slip box folder ever so slowly i changed the number when i deleted a couple of folders so my zettles are red and my newsletter stuff we don't need this right now my zettles are red and then my source notes are in what folder is that that's 43 43 folder 43. note how easy the johnny decimal thing makes that by the way so you can see how these source notes go with the zeddles that got created and then i reference them in other p and other places so this is one of my mocs that's not relevant and it's just like you can kind of see 42 is the subtlest so this is pretty cool so just talking it out the path so you're searching well you're filtering when you do path colon and 42 is because your folder is called 42 zettle or whatever and it's seen that and now you can color those so this is really cool between you know your your source note material and the zettles to see because the source note will act sort of like um a hub or a map of content and then the zettle should kind of hover around each hub in theory
