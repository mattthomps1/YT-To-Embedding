here and what's in here with everything that i have in my digital library to strengthen those connections because this is one of those meaningful books you don't do it with everything but i think it's valuable to do it for the meaningful stuff so for the workshop everyone takes on like the big project it might be work related who knows but for me i really want to pick apart this book and then hopefully have a good example of how you can really look at your favorite books outline them pull out the concepts relate those concepts to other things and then from that if you want create articles blogs produce things but even if you don't produce anything you're just more enriched from the process and as i've said before it just makes every conversation you enter that much more engaging and fun really and uh i don't know it's hard to put a price on that anyways hope you enjoyed more to come thank you [Music] [Music] you
