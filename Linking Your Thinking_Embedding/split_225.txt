okay we're going to do another kind of walk through it's not handheld this time but i'm going to be talking more about this process which is the knowledge process and it's part of a greater and more general knowledge loop okay so let's get started this is our world each of us has a world like this and when we were growing up our world what we thought was the world it was just us and it seemed like everything like one dot of everything as we mature and as we make connections and relationships with our family and friends we recognize that there are others but they still seem really close to kind of us so this is where that loop of knowledge starts there's encounters that we have and we express ourselves which then shape the encounters that we have and we get that process now over time we get a little bit more of an individual sense of ourselves however true or false that is we start to see a separation between us and the others around us so what happens if we embrace this is that there's a bigger space between encountering and expressing things so let's go back to this and that's where between encounter and expression we can create a space where we can get thinking in and so let's go up to see what that looks like so that's where we have others at this virtuous loop you us and then back to others we encounter something we then express ourselves that expression changes and shapes future encounters those encounters change us so this is the knowledge loop it's based on simple cause and effect we really can't escape it and if we're so lucky when the situation calls for it we can
