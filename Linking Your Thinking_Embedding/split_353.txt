luable thing the unmatchable benefit of the graph view has been on full display during this session can you figure out what it was in one word and five syllables triangulation in two words but still five syllables spatial context so let's explore triangulation now in fact i know it happens to be one of the notes i'm working on there it is there's the tag it's basically the process of determining the location of a point by knowing a couple other points and i find triangulation so fascinating because it's i think it's one of the reasons we really like reading the comments about something that we're watching say a youtube video we like seeing the comments on those videos we like seeing when somebody's giving us reactions to the thing that we're watching because if we're watching something and we're getting commentary on the thing that we're watching two points and then we're right here we can now triangulate and make sense of that and that exact thing is happening in the graph view and it's just it's fascinating so we go back to the graph view we see that triangulation happening specifically we actually created a triangle when we connected what was it we connected custodians are fragile with skin in the game we triangulated live during this session and that was like whoa that's that is the value of these that's how we generate value when we have these unexpected interactions isn't that pretty cool and finally spatial context if you're wondering what spatial context is that's how the ancients the the greeks and the romans made these memory palaces in their brain why does that w
