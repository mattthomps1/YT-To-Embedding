e in this   in this note one here and one here very cool boom that's repeat don't need that and let's go 
back now next hotkey okay so you start navigating   around and just like an internet browser sometimes 
you want to navigate backwards so there's actually   a hotkey for that obsidian is a pretty advanced 
app so instead of wasting real estate with big   back and forward buttons which will probably be 
some sort of plug-in later if you really want   instead the way to do that is to use hotkey 
in this case it's command option left arrow   left arrow left arrow left left left 
left left and just takes me back back   back same thing command option right takes me 
forward and that's number six two more to go   can you see how just a few hotkeys can really take 
your game to that next level final two new note   remember we were just going to new note we 
started this video series on new note well   if you can imagine it's command n that creates a 
new note so i just hit command n and i just start   typing and that's the title immediately 
it can be whatever you'd like it to be   then you hit the tab button and then just you're 
typing in the title so that's pretty nice how am   i going to get back to that old note i hit back 
boom i'm back and last part this kind of opens up   a whole new window of functionality so we're just 
hinting at it is that we can open a note in a new   window so what does that look like not a brand 
new window but a new pane so we command click   on a node so remember when we were in edit mode if 
we command clicked on a link it opened that note
