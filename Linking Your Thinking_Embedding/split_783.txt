lish open socket micro book i i am thinking that i want to redo this page to feature my writing first and then these other um like portfolio projects and like the portfolio projects i can open up one of them um you get a sense that these are more like traditional case studies and like one of the drawbacks is like it is sort of slow because it's like sort of heavy uh but it doesn't matter because like this is my personal portfolio page and it's like really heavy because i have a ton of like things in here um but these are meant to be just scrollable and things like that i'm really getting off on tangents here but i think like to answer your question is like the dilemma that every designer always has the joke is that they always are remaking their portfolio and then as soon as they make it they throw it away this has been around for i think two years mostly but as i write more it starts to be less meaningful because it's not capturing that work well that's good to know i like haven't really attempted to do like a version of this and i do feel like trying to put in things like if it was a professional project a personal project my knowledge library that definitely feels like too much in one place and so it's something i'll have to think through but i think that's useful to see how you've laid out uh what you have there and then maybe what you will put in in the future yeah i just have a little like aside to say with that one too um having a place that's like a link tree or a link page is a really great thing and i wanted to ask i don't know if anybody knows this right now beca
