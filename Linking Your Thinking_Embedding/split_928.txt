  and these are the notes that have the word 
linking in them i can zoom in further if i   wanted to that's kind of neat now let's just keep 
linking on and i can add tags so now we can toggle   tags and you know there's kind of been this push 
to get rid of tags and make everything uh a note   a direct link for some reason that didn't quite 
feel right it felt like we wanted to maintain the   sort of a weaker relationship between notes and 
this is one reason because now we can turn on tags   and see which notes are connected so these are all 
the notes that have linking not just in the title   but it can be in the body of the note as well and 
the associated tags don't worry we'll dive into   the examples i can also turn on attachments 
nothing for this i don't think which is fine   existing files only all right so now we'll 
notice that some files start to disappear   because i haven't created a lot of files i've 
only linked to them to create them in the future   and then we can also turn on orphan notes all 
right so these are notes i would also call most   orphan notes to be boats which are blocks 
of atomic thought they're kind of boat notes   they're just floating out by themselves so now 
we've turned all these things on we can look at   this graph and kind of check that out now another 
thing that's kind of neat is when we do create a   link between two notes it's a bi-directional 
link but really technically speaking   when you create the the link it's going from 
one direction to another and so we can turn   on arrows to make this explicit now now we 
can start
