hen you think of sync you think of you know between devices and versioning is part of sync though and that's i have to remind myself that because that's extremely valuable yeah they uh when i went through it earlier today and read the obsidian post on the information about sync that versioning they they keep those versions up to a year and then after that i think they start rolling off so that's about i mean a year is a long time but you know if you need to go back beyond the year it might be something to think about or something yeah for me i think i'm typically trying to go back a few minutes or a day or two i think it's really about me like copy pasting content and moving it around and being able to like tear things apart and build it back together that's where i don't need to worry so much about these things because when i talked about here i had [Music] this first draft these are like the linear chapters you know not uh let me open up a better one these are not written in this sort of atomic style this is just like how you would imagine writing in like a word doc or something i felt like it was although it was nice visually to write an obsidian like this i didn't have any of the security that i have with a lot of other tools where i can do comments track changes anything else so i was sort of missing that comfort to just like edit this whole thing in obsidian it was almost uncomfortable as good as it is in editing small things it was bad at doing this so that's why that version gives me that comfort of like oh i can freely edit this because i don't need to worry about
