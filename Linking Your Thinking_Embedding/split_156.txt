ss you know when you think of it that way versus combining because now we have building blocks they're always around and it's just let's dump them on the floor again and see what we can do i think i think there's more i think there's more to suss out here i guess my next question would be around practical ways that you've found to do combinational creativity where is it happening or how is it practical yeah um well you need to start with at least two ideas obviously if you want to combine something together it could be more ideas but i'll start with the two ideas just to make it simple and practical um there are three main ways that i've found are really helpful to get started with combinational creativity so the first one would be chaining ideas so you take them you take those two ideas and you ask yourself how does this first idea impact the other one um to give you an example i write a lot about mindful productivity and i've started recently again doing intermittent fasting and so chaining would be how does mindful productivity impact fasting for example how do you combine the two how do you maybe build a mindful productivity schedule and a way of working that allows for you to also better manage your diet et cetera so how does a impact be and you could do that for absolutely anything and it doesn't have to be linear it could be how does mindful productivity impact your diet and your sleep for example or how does mindful productivity impact your sleep and how does sleep impact your mental health and you can go in all sorts of directions like this by combining those ideas
