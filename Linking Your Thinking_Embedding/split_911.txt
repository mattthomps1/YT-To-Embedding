r all of them   if you stick around then stick 
around feel free to go as well   and we'll make sure you get 
everything you need david asks   and hey let me just put this into the chat it's 
kind of strange how these windows work in zoom can you talk about your process of building notes 
before you get to mapping them great yeah okay   so bottom up approach what's the relationships 
between say literature notes and more evergreen   notes how are you tracking sources attributions 
or do you bother okay so let's let's approach that   in this i'm using the light kit for the example 
here david i'm going to go into where is it at   so douglas hoff's daughter i i watched this 
youtube video a few months back and i just   decided let me take notes on this and kind of 
you know give a good example for everyone so as   my notes initially you did not look this 
pretty but i did go back and you know   pretty them up a little bit but i'm just taking 
notes right using um kind of an outline format and   when i got to a note that i thought i wanted to i 
was like whoa this is yeah this is a new concept   then i was like okay let's make a new note and 
then put that information here and so that's what   concept expansion became now this is my literature 
note right here in sources so i can always go back   to this literature note and kind of get the 
additional context the big note i want to say   with literature notes that you see here these are 
my words these are my thoughts and it's it's me   interpreting what i listen to and if if i did 
quote something because it was so perfect i
