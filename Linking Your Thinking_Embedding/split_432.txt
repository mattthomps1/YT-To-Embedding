viously had a lot of drawbacks namely you do it once and it's great but what happens when you start reading thereafter so that's what this plugin aims to solve so this is a fresh um obsidian vault on my machine with no real customization other than i've already ran the plug-in once just to give you an idea i have 35 000 highlights so the it does take a little bit here you can see well i think it'll say my number of highlights here so it takes a little bit of time to run 36 000 highlights now um so i ran it right before this and here you can see the output but before i get into there um i think everyone here is advanced enough to know how community plugins work and to go and search for it there are a couple read wise plugins ours is the one called read wise official um here you can see our readme we'll be adding community resources down here as folks make helpful like walkthroughs and guides is that how they use the plugin and then once you install it there'll be a screen before this it'll only have one call to action which will be connect to read wise you click that it'll take you to [Music] this page right here the obsidian page will connect and then you have to come back to obsidian to run the sync and you run that by hitting initiate sync or you can also do it from the command panel and just search for read wise you can do sync your data now and it will do your first export depending on how many highlights you have that may take a couple minutes or if you don't have many it should be relatively instant and so for for people using obsidian um with daniel hit there and one
