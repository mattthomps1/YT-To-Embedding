ey're totally different things yeah they're totally different things it's just fun to see you using it yeah um yeah so it's definitely a nice tool within this kind of i mean everything becomes i don't want to go too philosophical so i'm going to avoid that for now but anyways unrequited notes what are these exactly so these are notes out there that link to accretion but accretion doesn't link back to them it doesn't mention them so slightly different than a typical backlink and this is great for research because i can throw in notes if i'm trying to research on accretion and i can just make sure it links to accretion and when i come into this note to process things i can see oh what are some other notes i haven't gotten to yet and then i have this list waiting for me this isn't the best example because they relate this i mean it's just a random concept but then something else was these associated tags which is another way to allow ideas to accrete around this so anytime on i use the prefix on and then i can pre add anything so on accretion and then any other tag that exists i can make sure that it links back to this note so this is the bad example from today but i just grabbed some stuff from online that were related to accretion do a couple other things here and once you get comfortable you're not there you don't like sliding pants but for those who do like sliding pins you can just quickly move your notes around and it's beautiful this is all just keyboard me working with the keyboard right now just moving stuff around do you have pain relief yes i have pain relief yeah a
