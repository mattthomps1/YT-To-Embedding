 no you don't clean that up no i the the single word note is kind of the whole point it's everything that i have to say about china in one spot does that make i don't know if that makes sense i don't know if it makes sense no no no no i think i think um you know it makes a lot of sense and so by refactoring it you're always keeping it tied back to that that one word i was just wondering whether or not you wanted to flag those topic notes in a certain way so that when you're seeing the links you notice oh that's just a regular occurrence the word that's that's tying it to um an actual topic note oh i just don't link things where i don't like if you look at the backlinks a lot of them aren't linked that i i try to be clean about only linking with intentionality so like if it's in my backlinks it's because it's like a thing where i want to know that it's relevant for as opposed because the part of the problem problem part of the thing is that a lot of the story stuff that i write will like i'll have an entire like long-form story that includes things like silk and horses and and i don't want those words to get linked to my topic notes because that's not my like personal knowledge management part of my fault i i'm blurry on terminology nick is way better at that than i am but like there's there's the whole reason i use folders is because some of the stuff is like fiction and some of it is like the science of sheep and i don't necessarily need my fiction but sometimes i do so i link when i actually want that connection to be there so i can remember to follow up but it's kind of
