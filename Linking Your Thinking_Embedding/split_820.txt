then how would i contextualize and explain that to myself so that i can find that stuff again but then as the springboard for making something that i could then turn into a publication like i could vary i won't say easily but readily make a publication about certain aspects of this idea mystical computation and then when i need to dive down into you know what do i mean by mystical computation well i've got a note about that i gotta know defining that term even though this is an mlc and it sure has some context about it i still need to have a note where i have my terms defined for each of these things so i feel like that's a pretty comprehensive look of how we go from home note to a pretty broad moc uh narrowing down into a more specific interest that links out to individual small notes that links out into source notes that i've been capturing and then those are analyzed and contextualized into this moc i hope you enjoyed this sneak peek into jonathan's mind did you get anything out of it do you want to see more of these types of tours there's a lot more where this came from if you do please let me know below
