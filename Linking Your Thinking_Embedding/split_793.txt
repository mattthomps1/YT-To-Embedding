hi i'm nick milo and welcome to linking your thinking where we talk about the how and why of making meaningful notes here we are with another obsidian update 0.9.10 it's all about plugins what are plugins plugins are these things that imagine there's just something very specific you want to do in obsidian but that feature doesn't exist yet so people like you and me except very creative and very talented created something to scratch that itch that they had and since this has come out i've had some time finally to play around with all these different plugins and kind of find the top 10 or so that work really well for me and that's what i want to show you in this video so in the following video we're going to explore my favorite plugins and how i'm using them there are basically three categories i want to explore the first are the plugins i use every single day the second are the pretty cool ones that i use every now and then and the third is actually kind of in between but there are four plugins that if you use together they can allow your daily note making efforts to come alive and i think it's pretty cool in my mind i call it the unofficial daily note plug-in pack it's pretty pretty awesome and i'm excited to to show more with you let's explore and we're in okay so this is my home note and the the command that you probably already know but i want to highlight it is command o so if i hit command o i can open a new note so i can open writings boom i'm in writings i can hit command o that's ctrl o on a windows computer and i can type in my zeros and i can go back to my home no
