ts of pkm i mentioned the you are creative video that's where that comes from some basic like i'm new to obsidian stuff more advanced stuff on specific ways to use some of the plugins some workflow stuff included in that is a video replay of the xero tube city and workshop that i did a couple times now uh yeah and then there's like all the suite setup courses it's worth bringing up now for people who are interested in it because there is a launch discount so it's 99 i think right now and it'll probably be 149 after launch week that's really awesome uh so take advantage of that you you get if it if mike is new to you you have a sense of his voice and um how varied his interests are and his use cases and i'm sure there's a lot of great value from that i think it's funny just side note before we get back to the q a is that um it's like we've had a master plan to perfectly time out all of these things like you know i had the uh you asked me to do those questions and i finally delivered them to you we had this set up you have a course launch but it's just all i mean i know you're more organized than me but i'm just kind of you know in triage mode taking care of this and that and like oh here are your questions and oh can you come on this and you're like yeah sure i can do that um but it it may look like there's a lot of coordination but i'm really just kind of surprised at the coincidental timing of everything yeah stuff just kind of clicks into place uh it started with me reaching out to you because i love your perspective on all of the sense making note making uh mocs all that
