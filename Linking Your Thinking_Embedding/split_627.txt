this is my md notes default template and i will get into what md notes is in a minute things to note the alias is the site key which apparently i don't like super need but but i can see why it will be useful to have this because this is the thing that doesn't change like even if i go and like slightly mess with something it'll it'll be fine um and i actually don't need this anymore because i moved the date i like to have the date up here mostly for dataview um i there's a lot of information that academics use that i don't think is important like i don't need to know what journal this comes from i i don't care i don't know if that makes me a bad person but i don't care what journalist was published and i it's relevant for people who are trying to make sure that you know it came from scientific american and not something that's terrible it's relevant for people who are trying to figure out like you know what what journals like there are reasons to do it i just i the the longest hardest thing i had to do in order to make zotero work for me was getting rid of extra information not so much trying to find the information because academics care about so much more than i care about i just want my annotations the ability to go find it again and like a list of things uh i'm not sure if the recording will capture it but i i did a zoom clap because that's that's really important not to over metadata if you don't have the need you know there's the sense that oh i might need this someday maybe but that's the type of stuff that just drowns you out in noise and and false positives and dist
