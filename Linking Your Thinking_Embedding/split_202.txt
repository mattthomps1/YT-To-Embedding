er cards now cards might sound kind of strange   but in the world of linked notes when you're 
trying to save ideas into their own container   of thought a note you'll have a lot of different

the cards folder next up extras extras covers   everything in between it helps you keep your 
support material handy what goes in support   material like attachments graphics images manuals 
templates hand drawings whatever it is extras can   handle that next up we have sources this helps you 
build your external library of ideas so something   that we're coming to terms with in the digital age 
is that there's this explosion of knowledge and   there's also what we think about internally and we 
don't want to confuse the two all the time so when   we look at cards that's more of our place where 
we're creating our own little nuggets of knowledge   that we can link to each other effectively but 
then in sources we can save and keep outside   sources and make sure that they're organized in 
a way that we can find quickly through folders   just as
