e data view version these are my references with summaries these are the things that i have sat down and actually made a summary for which hasn't been much mostly because when you have an entire article that you've added like you don't you don't annotate like 17 articles in a day right like you you got to sit with it you got to pull the pieces out so i've done this for two of them and this one's commented out this is just a way to you can plop this at the bottom of um this query right here this is a table with the date and the summary and the tag and all but it only pulls a particular one so if i uncomment this you'll see if i'm looking just for the ones that match my query of a tag about textiles so i use this for filling in my maps of content like i can query once this is longer i'll be able to query everything that is about economics or everything that talks about domestication and then i can sort of double check and make sure i didn't miss anything when i'm making these maps of content so that's i know we had talked last time about how to use dataview for maps of content and that's how i personally have been doing it why isn't this working oh that's very strange so in my mind the data view is super powerful and awesome and it falls under if if i can call it this but like the power users side of things so not everyone would use it but it is super powerful and there are use cases and we can fall into the pitfalls like of using it and just like trying to you know metadata everything but there i mean as you as we're seeing right here you're using it in a really interesting
