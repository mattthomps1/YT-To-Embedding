hat and so i would have a um at the end of the review and i do this every sunday i would look at how i did in the last week and what i want to do better in the next week and then i do the same thing on a monthly and quarterly basis i go through each role you know and then some of this stuff i have subcategories here and so first i go through all the roles then i have a weekly checklist and that's just stuff that i do every weekend you know just stuff to keep my uh you know the wheel was the trains running on time or whatever so and i don't i historically i would do that omnifocus but i've moved this over because it just makes sense to have the checklist in the same place you do the review and then i have all these questions that i ask myself and i don't answer every question every time i do the review but i do have a bunch of them and then by creating them as links i can have a page that has backlinks to every time i address you know what should i do more of and uh so i can just go through this about i'm sorry go ahead i was just gonna say yeah i'm just curious about the the backlinks because you you were talking we're talking off-camera about with the daily note that the backlinks can kind of clutter up the graph and how yeah how funny it is how our tools shape our behavior so but with the week review it's still worthwhile to have in the backlink so it's probably not worthwhile honestly i set that up when i was still in you know a backlink nirvana or backlink you know that when you first start learning about backlinks you want to put them everywhere the template was set up
