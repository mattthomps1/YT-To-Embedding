'm really 
trying to advocate for when it comes to an moc   is that's how we develop information we talk 
about folders being top down and we talk about   um notes organically zettlecostin is bottom 
up a map of content is middle out it informs   the notes above it informs the the individual 
notes below that is the true power and so until   you've experienced it it's hard to consider an 
moc more than just an index node a structure note   but once you realize oh i get all these notes in 
a room together and i get them to fight it out   and battle it out and they become sharper 
they become better arguments they become   clearer notes and not only is that great for 
the end product but your process of doing that   makes you that much better of a thinker makes you 
that much more um able to recall the information   because you've done the work that's not note 
taking that's no making pretty awesome right okay   next question is there uh can i use light 
with foglesettle oh rabbit hole alert i   will say this that is the beauty of a map of 
content is it employs focal settle elements   right but you don't have the limitations of 
focal settle because i'm not going to go into it   but vocal zeddle means that you have all of your 
notes and they're in one specific rigid structure   another version of fogalcital is just using a an 
arbitrary timestamp you know why not just do that   but the point being is a map of content 
allows me to create a fluid vocal zeddle   let that sink in for you focal zettle users 
this is fluid because i can organize these ideas   a million different
