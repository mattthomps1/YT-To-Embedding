rfect circle or a perfect square so i'll use those for like the boxes around the the um the verses i try not to use it for the sketches themselves a whole lot because i think it just looks kind of weird there's something charming to me whimsical about the the non-perfect lines um but if you really didn't want it to be you know perfectly square it's easy to do that without slowing you down uh where did i get my copy of the bible pre-divided into one verse per file i had a friend who understands scripting make it for me joe bulig but there's actually a forum thread in the obsidian forum called bible study and obsidian where he shared that script and i use the king james version so it's all um royalty-free but uh there are other people who are doing it with like other versions if there's something else that you you wanted to do i believe you can just download that one though from the obsidian forum uh the ideas that are found in many books that's one of the reasons i start calling things out as their own individual pages like occam's razer for example is a note that i have that one pops up in just about every productivity book you read the simple solution is the the best solution book summary services i do not use i kind of feel like they're cheating it's like going to the gym and you're going to work out but you don't put any weight on the bar that's just my own personal preference i don't think there isn't necessarily anything bad with them if you want to understand the gist of the book without reading the actual book go ahead and sign up for blinkist or something like that
