 which you can nest in obsidian pretty powerful let's say i want to change this book tag which you can see right here in the frankenstein note i can just rename it here to gobbly goop and it's renaming that note in every single note so then when i open it up in the search sidebar let me collapse so it's a little bit cleaner and let's go to the random random note like on the almagist uh let me just move some of the make it a little bit wider for you you can see that in the tags it's updated now obviously we don't want to do that so tag wrangler allows you to quickly manipulate your tags like you should be able to i mean again this is one of those things that should just be second nature eventually i am confident it will be some sort of core plug-in that obsidian offers along with all the software to come like you just have to be able to do that stuff in today's day and age and the fourth one ah i'm blanking but i have recommended plugins so the calendar app so if you like the calendar mode if you like daily notes then you can go ahead and have a calendar so those are the recommended plugins i'm getting a lot of i like my my reason for doing all this is to to meet really fascinating people and to think with them and just to have fun thinking and improving how we do thinking and all that that being said everybody's asking about obsidian specific courses so before the end of the year i'm going to create my very opinionated upsetting course for thinkers fiddlers and noodlers so that should be fun and it will cover this sort of thing how do you handle security concerns when using
