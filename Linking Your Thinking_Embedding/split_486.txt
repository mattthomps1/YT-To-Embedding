 but to be honest with you i can't think of any time in the last six months i've gone to one of these pages to say give me a list of every time i wrote about that if anything i'll go back and look at the reviews but i usually look at them the following week the following month the following quarter um so in all honesty i should probably pull those backlinks out of those it's a work in progress nick this is it's a work in progress i'm not i'm not grilling you i did i'm trying to learn yeah yeah as much as possible yeah i feel the same the same way though it's um you we can go because we want to we we experiment a lot with links i experiment with a lot and then i'm like yeah okay that didn't that didn't work um that's fine that was my little two-week experiment um so let me go back to to this it's really funny and i'm torn between doing these in obsidian or doing them in day one because i have a journaling system so i i write in the journal but i live in a place that catches on fire yearly so um last year we got evacuated a few times and both times you know because of the rush of evacuation you know the police are driving down the street saying get out of your house and uh i just forgot to bring my paper journals and they were all if the house had burned down that would all be gone so i started now i scan the written journal page each day into day one and part of me thinks well maybe i should just do these reviews in day one but so far i i like obsidian because i can link them to projects and that actually is a backlink i like like when i'm writing down my thoughts about some
