he q and a's joe yep if there's any that really jump out to you go ahead i can answer asher's question about how are the links generated the way in which i did this is i used um there's a library in python called beautiful soup and it's a web scraping library so i scraped the entire encyclopedia downloaded all the articles and then i wrote a spider to basically look at individual parts of each article each article in the uh let me find it here i'll show you um every article in the sep has a section called related entries and what that is is those are the links that the editors and the authors uh see i can show to you here here we go so in this article here there is this article links out to three other articles so how i built the links for this is when i scraped the entire site i i captured every article in every related entry from this section of the page in every article i threw that into my database and then i ran a series of links looking at like what was going out from each article and then how those different links when looked at which linked into what and then that's how i built the actual graphs themselves is by looking at all the information in the related entry section for each of the 1708 articles and that's where we get the power because this is these are the articles that the editors were like all right the this is related and that's where that's where visualizing set gets all of its power it's from this related entry section that's pulled from every single article very nice something that seems to be standing out i'm looking at jon's uh comment or question the
