le to other ones or it could be the articles that link into and what this is showing you and what's interesting about this is it's providing the context and i think that's one of the things that makes visualizing sep really interesting your standard search engine is going to return a single scalar article it might show you other articles that might fit that same search term but it's not showing you the context and this is what visualizing sep is doing so it's showing you the context that russell's working in there are 77 articles which you can see here on this right side here this is showing you the primary domain the main thrust through the main category that each article was in and it's showing you how many and each of these categories has a color representation now it's the same throughout the site so epistemology is always going to be a light yellow ethics is this orangy pink and then down here this is going to show you the directional links so at first this is cool but you can really deep dive and once you mouse over things now you can focus on this particular thing that you're looking at so you wanted to see all the outgoing links so these are the 13 links that the russell article links to these are the 46 links that link into russell same thing is up here with the primary domains you want to see what are the philosophers that russell links to well now we're just focusing on this what's the philosophy of mathematics articles so you can just continually update your focus points and i think a really beautiful way to be able to kind of deep dive into some of this stuff h
