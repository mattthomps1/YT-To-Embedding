uh trying to find out what uh something actually is is going down to the etymological roots uh to build an understanding around a word from a first principles where did this come from uh what are the components of the word so the etymology of an aphorism it's actually derived from the word horizon so a boundary or a or a definitive boundary so it's kind of like a barrier between understanding um and then the infinite beyond that so an aphorism is like the demarcation of something it's that it's a definitive line on the distance that someone else draws for you so if we go into if we have a look at my linked thought of what an aphorism is and looking at the etymology so i was reading a book called the theory of an aphorism and the horizon analogy got kind of taken to the next level and it was the the horizon is a superficial boundary um and as you approach it it always kind of moves away from you so with an aphorism when someone when a smart person goes and puts a definition or a line between the universe and the infinite and what we understand we can look at it and say okay yep sure i agree with you that's the that's the horizon or we can walk towards it and while we may not we may not ever reach the horizon the journey itself is can be very enlightening on all of the things you find along the way even though the horizon is always there on the distance so i went back and had a look at like what was the actual first aphorism that came about and what's it what's the origin story of an aphorism and it was actually uh hippocrates the father of uh modern well not modern medicine
