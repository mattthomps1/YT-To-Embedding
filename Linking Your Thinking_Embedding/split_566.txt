e field one day and you say well you know why is a tree at this angle and then you think well i can actually measure how high it is if i know this angle and the distance so all of a sudden using this well it's more like geometry but you can connect it to another note in your note making personal note library and so all of that stuff is going to create a fuller experience of you learning this material so it supports and compounds in value and it's not just a turn and burn you know get a passing grade move on to the next one kind of hard to answer on the fly but hopefully that gives you something to chew on are there any plug-ins you'd recommend to make the sense-making session much better yeah totally well the thing is so if you are using obsidian you don't have to really use any of the community plugins to make this work there are only four that i would recommend and out of those four there's only one and out of that one you don't have to use it so what are the four first one is sliding panes well here i if i show my screen it's a little bit more helpful so let me so for the plugins like this was our session i'll make it a little bit smaller if i can okay i could put bitcoin in a new window fluid thinking novelty bias okay so sliding panes means that if i hold down shift and then i scroll with my mouse wheel i can kind of go to left to right to mimic index cards so for me i love it you might not so that's one community plugin that i use the other one that i absolutely love is called note refactor i think that's the most important for note making and for sense making times b
