ips with you don't have to do anything with them if you don't want to like it it works out of the box what i did was a lot of customization so the the neat thing here is it comes with this empty notes default template and then i will split screen this so you can see how i changed it so normally it's just the title and then there's a bunch of like metadata that it'll make two different files for you and then it'll tell you the file names of all of that stuff and then it'll give you these zotero links so if you'll notice like i kept some of that right like i still have a title i still have the local library and then there's this notes thing is all of the like actual extracted annotations and stuff okay that's the default as you can see i super don't care about like the i don't want multiple files for this i understand why academics would but i like that's that's too that's too much for me for what i'm doing so normally it would come with all of this metadata here's the date and the date you downloaded and then the related things and here's like a bunch of extra tags and then here's all of the like here's the abstract and i i just i don't want that abstracts you're great don't get me wrong but i i prefer to write my own summaries because the things i care about are not the things that the researcher cared about like 80 of the time so this is pretty great so the way by the way that's a really cool get book that argentina set up but it's it looks like to me then that it's it's set up uh for the academic for the researcher which makes it which is fine yeah it totally totally but
