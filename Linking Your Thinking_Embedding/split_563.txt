ying to really force force that thinking um but it doesn't mean that we support it so even you should feel the freedom to type something that you don't believe in with bitcoin i made a supposition that was kind of a joke it felt like a comedy routine i didn't believe in it but i just it's starting something and then i can challenge it and say well do i really even think that um and then what's and then to joel's point you can take it further and actually look a little bit more at the grounds and evidence and to to see what those arguments stand on do you cover note making of non-fiction books so this must be referring to the workshop um yeah we we do cover in unit 5 how to process information and some of that information are books including non-fiction books um so we do spend some time on that again we don't spend so much time on it because uh there's kind of an obsession with all that input stuff and so that's where everyone gets caught and stuck and they don't move on from that so that's why instead of making it the first unit the input stuff is actually the second to last unit and then that way we can focus on our own processes first our own thinking and then by the time our own personal knowledge management customized system so by the time we get to unit 5 now we kind of understand what is signal to us versus what is the noise but yeah then we do have um some basic workflows for how to process things like non-fiction books i'm not familiar with obsidian tools do you also cover that oh yeah and we do it's not the linking and thinking workshop is not a course on obsidian
