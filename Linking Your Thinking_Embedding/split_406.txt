 problem is that by looking at where that thing is you're defining what it is and yet what it is from uh conceptually can be so many different things and so this is why i think we've seen flat structures become really popular in node systems because if you use links you use maps maps of content and you use tags and so on instead of folders you're not dealing with this tyranny of classification you're not defining what something is by where we're putting it we're actually letting it be itself and then using the properties of that thing to decide what it is when we use it and that was the point of the paper that's it's an almost agnostic way of approaching any bit of information you're saying i don't quite know who you are or what you are i know you're definitely this right now for me but i don't know for sure you're always that and i don't want to always put you there it's it's i don't know it's a it's kind of a curious way of approaching information that becomes knowledge as we start interacting with it right right and here's the here's one last piece on that the real worry that jeff had about classification and why it was tyrannical was because every time we classify something every time we store something by thinking about what it is first we actually go through this goes back to cognitive load and cognitive capacity we actually use features of our brain's ability to classify things to cut out parts of that thing and we lose it and so what jeff was worried about was when we're capturing data and he wasn't thinking about notes but when we're capturing data about something
