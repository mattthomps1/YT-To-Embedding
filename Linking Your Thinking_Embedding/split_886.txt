consider back and above and for me that's the mindset moc so yeah i could just have it go to home or i could just use the quick switcher but what i'm trying to do is you know create this sort of amoeba-like fluid framework structure in my own mind and and that's kind of why i use these front matter links additionally i do like just kind of clicking around quickly i do think there's somewhat of an advantage with that but to your point no functionality is lost ooh so is linking your thinking the complete opposite of progressive summarization well i'll be i'll be um political on this one i got into a little bit of heat because i went a little bit too strongly against progressive summarization there is certainly value to it what i want to get at is that you hm how can i best put this we are in the age of the lynx note do you want to be a note taker or a note maker which one do you think makes more value creates more value note making creates more value not just for other people but for yourself like that's that's you thinking and working on ideas so note making is more valuable progressive summarization is more on this note-taking side of things where you know you're you're highlighting and bolding and sure this is valuable you should do this but i'm just saying like if there's a spectrum this is you know um a line graph and you know this total value is 100 percent progressive summarization should not be 70 of what you do it shouldn't be 50 in my opinion it should be closer to like 10 or 15 and that means that 85 is dedicated to the progressive ideation you know the note making
