cinating admirable and brilliant okay it looks like i have a high opinion of paul stamets currently and then mushrooms as medicine paul stamets is the clear leader in this field as we see it's over here so i'm thinking out loud emergence is seen in large groups well for one it's just nice to connect it this note was on an island it had zero connections and now i have some connections it's nice to see that i'm not even going to go into the local graph i'll try not to but now we would have some nice local graph connections too and this all stemmed from this view from using a tag and then looking around but let's dive further into this so a little bit of work so far nothing major but pretty happy just to have made some connections so if we go back to the graph view now we see that mushrooms as medicine is connected to emergence is seen in large groups so we've made what would you call that shape i guess it would be a triangle so that's kind of cool so between these two notes and the tag we've triangulated something that's interesting maybe we'll come back to that what else should we explore i mean so many good ones we chronically underestimate how long something will take and so i'm just feeling myself like what am i what is the soft wall to push against to get the ball rolling to you to kind of get in that state of flow great works are flavored by early works okay this is a fairly recent and it took me a while to get to this before i got to this i was working on some pretty cool uh well i haven't looked at that yet but i was watching some pretty interesting things about art h
