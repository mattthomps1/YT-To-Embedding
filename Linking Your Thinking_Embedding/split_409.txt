 there and so on and what obsidian gave me the power to do is put all those things in the same place i don't have to go open an omnifocus window with the project that i'm working on with the list of tasks that i have and look through that list of 20 tasks and identify where it fits in the paper i'm currently writing that's 20 pages long and then open that thing in word all of that was too much for me so instead i have tasks where they are like i have tasks right next to the paragraphs that they're associated with and i have thinking right next to that so so i do probably need to take what you're thinking in order to figure out how to how to use obsidian a bit more knowledge management directly so i think for me the way i i filter that is it's semantics i guess for me because you are doing idea development within your project management it's just you're very your use case if i was to say it out loud i might be incorrect your use case is so targeted and focused with what you you want to think around this area and so and you you want to have a deliverable there too so you you kind of have some sort of end you don't know how you're going to get there but you're eventually going to get to this place and so it seems like yeah so it seems like it's still it's it's doing what you need to it's just very targeted and you know you're doing all the the sense making as you go along yeah yeah and it's i mean i think i do think i'm doing it backwards it's like i i think i had a great uh chat with somebody on the obsidian forum about this the other day and people were very informative such
