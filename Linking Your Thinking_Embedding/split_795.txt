 all the plugins i had let me do that okay the plugins have been activated which you can see here now let's talk about how to access the plugins what you want to do is when you're in third party plugins go to this community plugins and hit browse now these are sorted by the amount of times that they've been downloaded so again if you have any doubts about a plug-in use the most popular ones because just like wikipedia works that means the most eyes have been on it and it has had any sort of revisions basically it's been vetted by the community and if it's here that means that it's probably pretty safe to use at least that's my interpretation so we can see the most popular plugin is calendar which we will get to so a quick honorable mention this is why it's so cool sometimes that if you just install a bunch of plugins always remember command p because i can just hit watch this command p and i was like what if i wanted to create a mind map and maybe not of this note let's let's try this one of my home note let's make a mind map immediately out of this home note so if i just hit command p then i'm like whoa what was that mind map thing well i don't have to remember if i can remember mind map then i'm just going to type mind and then hit enter and then right next to it what is this this is pretty cool right so this is a mind map showing the structure of that note and it's all laid out pretty cool now you can't edit in it so it's limited it's of limited use i would say but it is pretty cool this is something i could always save which is an option if you go down here you can copy
