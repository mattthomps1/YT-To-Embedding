at is important for me as a writer is a good workplace a clean space and i love this picture of the matrix where morpheus has this white room i think people who saw the movie know this is just this clean space and he can just pull in what yeah he wants to show and work with and then he can push it out again afterwards and has always this clean space to start off from and this is very important for me as a creative person to have this kind of space that's why yeah i created my world in this way you will see soon and what's also very important to me is the control i'm kind of a control freak i really want to have the feeling of that i know where things are and yeah so that's why i at the beginning of the course thought i will always have my folders and not get rid of them at some point because i thought my folder structure is quite good i can show this to you how it looked like at the beginning i had like um folders according to my writing process so the first big part would be the non-fiction stuff so i had sources different folders for articles and everything and my own thoughts and then of course atomic nodes moses and then i would go and create blog posts from the mocs books workshops whatever and yeah here in this part you see the that i had for my novel projects i have several projects and every project would have in have a folder with subfolders and so i thought i will still need those folders but in unit 4 i decided to take the leap and try something new and so i will show you what my home looks like now or maybe i can even make it a bit bigger i have only three folde
