 having this you right like let's say your notes explode you can still get this information this is just an information view it's not corrupting your notes or anything yeah but now you can see look i didn't know that all of those people had to do with jazz so and that's another so i was going to click in to show you but now you've i don't even have to click in to show you because of what you just showed me but um i will show it just because it's somewhat related so if we click on this person and then they're going to have a link over here but what i wanted so i did the same people list except here's here's the tag that i'm using you could i'm sure you'd figure out a different different way i would probably do it differently but yeah i would get the same information right yeah but so now with sortable in life preview sortables this blew my mind so not don't look at duke elliott at ellington but look at these other people 1920 to 1926. i randomly chose these people just based on songs i was listening to and was enjoying and it turns out they were all born yeah they're all born very specific generation of jazz that you like nick that's what i've learned i don't know i don't think that's necessarily it i think it uh i think well that's part of it so you're not wrong but i just think that speaks to what was going on to make this all come alive and so spurs on this whole line of research that i think can be quite fruitful so i just think that's uh pretty wild oh go back go to uh go back to the page you were just on this one yeah um have you played around with call outs yet oh no
