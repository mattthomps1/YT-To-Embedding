ind of those are we could say it was somewhat similar and i think the broadest term is management that can fit it all so that unfortunately you know that's what it's currently mostly called but to your point and and i think where the most value is is when people are using these tools for as you're saying innovation for making new connections that bring meaning to to their world whether it's around them or internally and and it's so yeah i i feel strong alignment with what you're saying there and that and also to that point how janitorial work is both good and bad depending on how it's approached and and what the purpose around it is it's fantastic if it's forcing you to think not so much if you're just trying to clean up a bunch of metadata because you have a template and you're supposed to fill out 20 different metadata items that you forced upon yourself but aren't really earned yeah yeah or if you're trying to avoid some other deadline or yeah instead of instead of drawing new icons on a home screen you're trying to add specific metadata to a thing yeah thank you joel by the way wonderful provoking question and we're hitting the hour mark the only thing i know we have more questions we won't be able to get to them all but there's also a walkthrough of your messy main vault where you possibly do some strange things and i didn't want to make sure that we overlook that completely is that something you still want to share you want to focus on the questions yeah so i think i've peered that effectively through the talking about project management but one of the okay things tha
