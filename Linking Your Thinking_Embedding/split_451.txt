d sparks hope you're doing well david um can you show again how you are doing block quotes and getting the blocks for into individual quotes instead of groups uh yes so the one by default there'll be a dash here um for a bullet so i switched that dash to a black quote and then the most important thing is i insert a new line down here if you don't insert this new line it'll smash together if you do put the new line here then it will separate and when it comes into obsidian it will have this very important space here which makes it look separate if i get rid of this space you can see that it emerges that's just i don't know why obsidian chose to render black quotes this way but they must have had a good reason very cool very cool next one up if we use dataview is it much better to include all hashtag metadata as a yaml at the top of the page i have never played with dataview i only learned about it while in like the late stages of polishing this integration so i would actually defer to you nick if you're a dataview expert yeah i actually am not i'm pretty slow to the game with adopting dataview although i think it's great and its functionality is fantastic if we use dataview is it much better to include the metadata as yaml at the top of the page well i guess my answer to that would be i don't have a strong need to use yaml and sometimes it forces me to add things i don't want to add so with that in mind as i'm using data view i'm just going to add the double colon which allows it to be inline where data view can recognize so you know instead of having to put it in the yaml i
