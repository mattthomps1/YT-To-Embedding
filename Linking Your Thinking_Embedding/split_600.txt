a messy system that works for me and is not always obvious to other situations and use cases yeah now that makes sense that makes sense you have intentionality with your your links and um yeah the folders are quite good too how are we doing so i want to make sure to respect everyone's time and because we start a few minutes after the hour mark i think we can go a few minutes after the next hour mark could you explain as a too long didn't read the johnny decimal system the johnny decimal system is a way of organizing all of your files in no more than like two levels deep is that the right way so like folders and then subfolders um basically using buckets that are clearly defined the whole point is that you're never in a situation where you don't know where the file goes it was originally designed for like big complex businesses and schools so that employees would know where to file something and it wasn't like i don't know how many of you guys have ever used a shared like um in intranet but like at my work there's like 17 000 folders and they're like seven piles nested and like everyone was in charge of a different thing and nobody knows where anything goes the point of the giant decimal system is to apply some order to that so that it is always extremely obvious where something lives and one of the reasons i refractor every couple of months if you look at um if you look at this compared to this you'll see that i changed stuff around is because if there was ever a moment it's the reason i flattened my vault if there's ever a moment where you're not sure which folder somethin
