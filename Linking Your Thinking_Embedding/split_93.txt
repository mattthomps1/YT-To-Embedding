u initially pull up the open graph the local graph it will open up in a different tab group over here now just remember you can move around tabs wherever you want to so what I did long ago is I took this local graph and I threw it over here so now we have the same local graph twice one zoomed in the other is not let me just get rid of one and now we're back to The Way We Were that takes us through let me zoom out that takes us through the first I believe around 27 of my top 44 obsidian plugins and functions all ranked oh my goodness can you believe that I'm still going I can't I have not taken one sip of water because I wanted to keep up a fast pace to get you the most meat per minute and if we were to continue this is the final this is the final part of the list I'm not going to go through each one I'm just going to talk about the one-liners Wikipedia a simple plugin this person also took the link in your thinking Workshop thank you Jonathan what's so amazing about this is that it allows you to quickly put in little bits of Wikipedia into a note I won't get into the details sortable this will probably go away once Michael Brandon comes out with data core but it allows you to quickly sort data view tables word count this is a core plugin and as you can see over here it allows you to have word counts pretty awesome better word count at 85 gives you a little bit more and allows you to oh I got them backwards this is the core word count and this is better word count how do I know the reason I have better word count is so when I highlight things notice what's happening down her
