it view and I've got them both another thing that helps prevent tab hoarding is a feature called little Arc hit command option n anywhere start typing a site name and boom you get this mini browser with almost no UI if I want to check a movie time let's say I can just pop up a little Arc I can take a look I can close it done it's a simple way to keep unimportant tabs from getting mixed up with all the important ones here's another brand new feature They just added right now Peak if you click a link to another site you get this pop-up preview you click away and it's gone so great we are entering the home stretch friends just a quick mention of some other notable features firstly for obsidian users here's a fantastic one hit command option shift C and you get a markdown link you get the page title with a link I use this all the time it's incredibly handy and you can also hit command shift C to just get the URL also over here on the left is something called the library which has screenshots even your desktop and also your downloads the most notable feature however is called easel which lets you grab screenshots and type text and draw lines and arrows it's kind of like canvas in obsidian I've not gotten into using this but something I really like here is that it maintains links to where everything came from so when you take a screenshot you can easily get back to the original Source that's whoa that's really amazing and screenshots they are awesome in Arc look at how your cursor snaps to Regions and then you choose what you want to do with the capture there it is the best solut
