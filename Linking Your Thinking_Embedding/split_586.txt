t it's giving real or implied it's because this act this yaml actually says it and it's i think maybe ross is here i don't know but um it's picking up that it's not literally in the yaml it's not a specific relationship but because i assigned it in this other thing can you go back to the one you were just on i just want to see how it compares to the link mentions below and it looks like an unlinked message anyways something to dive deep into but i think there are definitely use cases for that adding very specific uh metadata to show connections um with more context to them there's definitely a lot going on there so kind of a full full gazettel approach the idea i'm i don't know that i'm like doing it right but i i like the idea of more structured kinds of connections not for the middle of my slip box like the middle of the block should be a delightful spaghetti mess but these very specific workflows that i have of here's my research here's the notes here's the story here's the analysis piece here's the newsletters like they're i mean i realize that they're all newsletters now but in my head that like monday morning very structured like the this thing this is more what i mean when i say like the newsletter like this it's a very they're all this format of a couple fun facts and like a bit of a deep dive but not not like a long-form analysis piece so like all of those connect in a very specific way and i wanted to have something a little bit stronger than the links in the backlinks and the graph to show me that very strong connection so thanks ross you're great cool so where d
