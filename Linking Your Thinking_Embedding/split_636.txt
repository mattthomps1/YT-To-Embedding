ow i i cite my sources but i don't do it in a formal way i i do it with a link so i'm i'm able to ignore like 90 of what zotero is for and i imagine that most of the people who are doing the linking your thinking stuff or watching this or hanging out in obsidian are like not trying to have formal bibliographies for everything they do and caring about whether or not there's a distinction between the chicago and the apa and the mla styles so that's why this is the default site key but i prefer slightly more context because i don't care what fox did in 2000 like that's not meaningful to me so i like to unpin them and then you see how it just like magically formatted into a format that was that was like wow that was pretty cool you know i mean even even to have it display like that gives you a little tingle instead of just like a boof it's like it's like yeah you know you see it happening that's great i love it so unfortunately you'll note that these don't have these don't have pdfs they don't have any attachments and i'm going to pause here and note that i chose which things i want to see here so uh you you can change this like so all of these are journal articles but like i i don't find that useful a lot of people will find the publisher useful but i don't so like there are other things that you can add that i have chosen not to i care about the date i care about who made it and i like to have the psyche available to me and then the title it's funny the column is called creator that's like so not like writer or public well yeah because you can do youtube videos with this you
