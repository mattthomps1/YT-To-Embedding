 so the first thing I want you to know and these are some really nice Maneuvers to know is just being able to zoom in and out so to do that hold down command or control on Windows and then you can just zoom in and out it's kind of interesting once you zoom out a little bit images go away and we can still just see the colors and the overall shape so if I zoom back in I can start to see things so that's good to know now the other movements that you'll want to be aware of is just how to even create something new so let's do this in the test canvas what I want you to notice is that there are buttons on the upper right and there are buttons at the bottom left so let's hit this which is currently called drag to add card it might change so I'm just going to do that and it creates a card on this canvas so I'll say this is a card and now it exists so what you'll notice at the Four Corners are little pop-ups so if I just click on it nothing happens but if I click hold and drag it will create a new card this 2 is a card Okay so we've just created a connection on this canvas we'll talk about the functionality that currently exists later and the functionality that might exist in the future and we'll cover that before this video is over something else you can do is add media so here's one let's just add my friend mihai chick sent me high this is an image that's already in my Vault so you can see how quickly I can start using images already existing here guess what on Windows and file explorer on Mac and finder open it up find an image you can literally drag and drop it onto this canvas b
