but yeah we'll we'll be releasing this in like the next month or two this this browser extension right here hey daniel um david sparks has a question he's asking will the read wise web highlighter plug-in get safari support as well so safari historically apple has made it very difficult to port browser extensions from chrome which has a dominant market share of the browser market to safari which has a very small minority so as developers when they keep rug pulling on us you know and creating weeks of work for us for no reason it's very hard for us to willingly support safari which i know is frustrating as so far as your preferred browser that being said safari recently made it easier to port extensions over so it is on our roadmap to do and um as paul knows we're going to be porting this to safari pretty soon but that's i'm just giving you some context as to why it's not like something we do out of the gates it's just very frustrating they keep changing their standards and it creates a lot of unnecessary work for no reason i i think uh you must know this but the the idea of the read wise highlighter uh plug-in as is is generating a lot of excitement in the in the chat and otherwise that's uh that's pretty cool yeah just email if you guys want to get on the private beta just feel free to email me and aaron and we can hook you up daniel um where does firefox stand on the plugin list we have this for firefox firefox uses um chrome extensions but they have a more stringent uh approval process but we've been approved by them all right i'm a firefox user so it's good to hear davi
