h as yours it's just been unbelievable they definitely have a lot of foresight when with how they built this to be kind of plug-in first and very very very customizable um we're definitely very impressed with what they've done yeah well hey thanks for providing that sort of perspective to the conversation and i having that sort of agnostic approach the vc and how you know for for people using read wise understanding where you're coming from and what your your goals are and how you prioritize i think is is valuable to know because there's an investment it goes both ways it's not just you know the monthly or the annual but it's also you know do we do we trust everyone here to steward their product in a way that meets my personal needs or you know so it's really great getting that insight i think um we're gonna going to open it up for q a pretty soon here but i want to make sure we also cover anything else how are you doing so far with everything there daniel is there anything that we're we should still uncover yeah i mean just a couple other aspects of the plug-in that we didn't hit um you can notice here my vault is named read-wise but within this vault there's a folder named capital r read wise which contains all my my highlight um you can change the name of that from readwise to whatever you might prefer using this option within the plugin you can also customize uh how often the sync runs right now i've got it set to manual meaning i need to either hit this initiate sync or use the command panel like we showed at the very beginning in order to trigger resync alternatively
