member i can paste everything like this now and look at all these links that it forms if we go to the actual graph view i have some filters going let me get rid of that so really quickly if you do this let's see if we can find what we just created all right this is the new daily note that has all the links i pasted now look at this graph i have to tell you this daily note should not have this much attention brought to it it's just a workspace it's a workbench so imagine if i did this a few more times my graph would be a mess and it would not be a helpful mess it would be a mess of of all these links that i've dirtied up my my uh digital library with so what i'm saying is you have to be careful the best way if you're in a rush and you're not able to completely sort everything and discard everything is to give it the tag workbench or something like workbench because now when i go to graph view let's say it's all a mess because i've been working really fast now i can start to clean it up and the easiest way now is i can just search that tag workbench and for this example i just have this one but i can find all of these big workbench notes with all these links that i haven't really organized and discarded and then i can make sure that i'm keeping things organized and tidy i hope you enjoyed this first look video at obsidian 0.9.3 it's covering workflow and workflow is really cool i think we can become sort of obsessed with workflow and it's not healthy you always want to remember why you're doing it what you're trying to accomplish and so in the linking your thinking workshop w
