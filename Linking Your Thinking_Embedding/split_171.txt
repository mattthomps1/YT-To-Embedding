h as i said beginning really the idea that by creating your own version of a piece of content you're going to remember it and understand it better and by creating your own version it can really be as simple when you're taking notes uh to not just write whatever you just heard like whether it's you're taking an online course or you're having a conversation or you read something interesting just rephrase it in your own words and that would be really the simplest version of this and then you can take it to another level which is what i did with creating full blog posts about ideas in my own words again videos podcasts whatever you generate basically is going to help you remember and understand the content better that's the generation effect wonderful wonderful all right let's see lolita how would you take into account acknowledging the source of an idea when creating your own aka not risking plagiarism when in the process of putting things in your own words or creating your own idea thanks uh it's fine it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by william inch he's an english writer and he said that originality is undetected plagiarism so this is i think uh really the only way to to do this um is just to kind of link to the original ideas and you'll see that if you go on my blog and any kind of uh blog writer or content creator that's honest about the fact that their creativity is combinational is going to have references to where they found the inspiration and it's amazing when you read that kind of content because it's like breadcrumbs you can click on the links and see oh t
