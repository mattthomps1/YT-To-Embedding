 system something else that's kind of interesting is you can or sort this by days alive if you wanted to and see that this one was just saved two days ago well this one has been saved a week ago kind of cool well let's go up hit this home note and now we can jump into the final aspect to get you running and that is the light kit note so this is going to provide an overview of the light kit now this is about 300 notes so as we jump into the light kit i want to just walk through this moc for you and moc is actually something that is explained in the light kit mlc but in general it is a map of content and there's a lot of confusion around what a map of content is i'll have to work hard in other videos to explain this but in general it is a note that has links to other notes and the map of content serves three purposes for you it helps you gather ideas it helps you develop those ideas and then it helps you navigate those ideas so when most people think of an index note what is an index note doing it's helping you navigate notes but an index note does not help gather and develop those notes develop is the strongest most next level form of thinking that linked notes can provide you and so that needs to be emphasized at every single turn whoa i can actually develop notes when i stick them close to each other and start having them kind of talk and interact with each other that's outside the scope of this video but that is the power of the map of content so it's easy to think of higher order notes as passive static index notes they can be that but they can be so much more and that's
