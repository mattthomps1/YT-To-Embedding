that in mind let's do a few more questions let's see could the read-wise highlighter potentially replace instapaper or pocket or is it not meant to absolutely definitely and again i think it ties into what you're saying about it's up to you with your reading experience yeah i mean some people use pocket as more of like a bookmarking app than they do necessarily a reading app and if you're using it as a bookmarking app like to save a recipe or youtube video the highlighter won't replace that but if you're using it as a place to send content that you want to read and then highlight and annotate the highlighting extension can definitely replace that have you considered exporting each highlight to an individual file for more atomic note and there's that's a good question um obviously rome has a block-based architecture in contrast to obsidian which is more page-based um so within rome each bullet becomes a block that can be referenced later so it works nicely there and we know i didn't know this before this past week but i guess a roam clone called log sac works uh complements obsidian very nicely and then it has a local first architecture and can kind of pick up on these files so we're going to look into whether or not we can accommodate logstack even better or at least like users kind of using a combo of both apps notion we export everything to a notion database and right now we kind of create a page within the database and then put in each highlight now because it is a proper database we could potentially put each database or put each highlight as a row into the database and
