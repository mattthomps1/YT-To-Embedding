 and building a little chain basically um until you start discovering interesting questions and stories that you want to explore further um another one that um works really well is clustering so instead of just chaining them like this in terms of which how does they do they impact each other it's looking at what they have uh in common the common themes that they have together and those are some of the the most fun ones that you can come up with like um what do creativity and mental health have in common what do um cities and living organisms have in common what do gardening and project management have in common so you can take two ideas and the talking about playfulness but the the more random they are and the more different they seem the more fun this exercise is to try and find the common points between the two and the more random and again there's no real originality but the more random they are the more likely you are to stumble upon something that very few other people have been looking at before which can be really fun as well and the last one is comparing and contrasting ideas and just asking yourself how are they similar how are they different is one better than the other um so yeah there's a book i really like i highly recommend called the hidden life of trees and it's the the author i can't remember his name but um he's the one who coined the term wood wide web the idea that all of the plants and and trees and uh and fungi they're all connected together they communicate together the decent signals and messages and collaborate together and so the way they approach
