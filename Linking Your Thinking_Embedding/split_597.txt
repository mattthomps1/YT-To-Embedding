l would you also if you'd like to maybe you can add some sure so yeah hi eleanor thanks so much for all you're doing it's fantastic um so it's it's especially with the outgoing lynx um pain right because if you look in that and uh and you you're on china or you know you get or you're somewhere else and you um you have a you have a text that has china in it and you're getting like all these all these links to every place where the word china comes up and i saw you also had moc but that comes up all over the place so i think for me i sometimes struggle with being able to take advantage of outgoing links in particular with a word like that that comes up so frequently so the i guess kind of one of the reasons that i have a note for that word is because they're almost always my massive content i nick is gonna have to correct me if i completely like misbrand his system because i stole shamelessly and then did not apply it with fidelity but my um most of mine are like very kind of indexy encyclopedic things and their their purpose isn't really to look at the outgoing links like i i just never look at that for a file like that i don't um i don't care about it except for the graph view because then i can see how often i'm looking at different things um like it kind of makes like you don't make china really big and like oh right okay like i've i've done a lot with china maybe i should like hmm i could i could maybe write an article about everything i know about china like it's if you don't flag it in the title you don't flag it in the title as moc babylon you just keep the word there
