hest praise out of basically anyone I know and I want to write a little bit more about Carl Sagan for whatever reason I was talking about him recently so I want to talk about why he's so special in my thinking and so I want to write a little bit more so let me pay something I just wrote to save us both time when I think of Carl Sagan I think of mihai mihai That's So mihai chick sent me hi what Carl Sagan did for my love of the cosmos mihai did for my love of flow both have enriched my life and it just so happens that I can make mihai into a link because I have a note on this person if you don't know who he is he's the person who coined the term flow also known as optimal experience that feeling of being in the zone so for those familiar with the Noma method the note making method you'll notice that in these 34 words I've already gone through the big four prompts and those are that reminds me it's similar because it's different because and it's important because those are the four major prompts of the Noma method so what we see here is when I think of Carl sagin it reminds me of mihai chick sent me high okay so that reminds me and Carl is similar because of my love of something but different because instead of the cosmos it's about flow and it's important because both have enriched my life this is note making my friends and it's how we draw out us our unique perspective out of billions and billions of humans how many have made this connection maybe only one maybe at most a handful but here's the thing the note maker can't help but reveal and draw out their unique perspective
