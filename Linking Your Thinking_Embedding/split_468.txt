this conversation is that we can kind of just have a bunch of different you know chat so i'm going to do my best to pretend that everyone's not here for now sure and that's just you and me and like i'm gonna start off with the softball though uh would you consider yourself a lifelong geek yeah absolutely absolutely what did i mean where did that come from i don't know it just you know just is you know i mean i remember so i was born in 1968 so i've got a few years under my belt but when i was a kid you know technology was really exploding and you know the original computers were coming out and i was just drinking it up i've told the story in some of my speaking engagements but there was a radio shock about a mile and a half from my house growing up and they had at that time the tandy colored computer which if memory serves i think it had 4k of memory and i you know my parents didn't have any money they weren't going to buy me ex and computers were really expensive back then so i would literally ride my bike to radio shack every day and the guys that work there were really friendly and they they would let me sit at that computer and program it all day i taught myself basic and some of their assembly language and i started writing programs and games and then you'd save them to cassette tape you know because that was the the means of saving back then and then they would use them to sell the computers when people would come in to buy a computer they'd load up one of my programs and show it to the customer so it was kind of a mutually beneficial relationship but for several year
