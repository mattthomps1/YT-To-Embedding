d you keep on judging yourself for not being original enough combination of creativity is active it's more mindful and it's also a lot more playful playful seems to be the key word there and a playground it's like we're a child jumping back into the sandbox and there are some other kids in there we're all waddling around and we we learn and we play i love that so those are some of the benefits so far of combinational creativity a playful attitude the site understanding that we have permission to combine it makes me think just as a tangent and you probably know about this and i i don't and i should where did this i don't know if you have an answer here so i don't want to put you on the spot but does anyone know or do you know where this notion came from that we have to be these original artists the the these original uh i think okay don't quote me exactly on this but i think it comes from ancient greece and from the actual muses like they actually had those deities that were uh kind of the the guardians of of creativity and of ideas and and i think the that's why the poets in ancient greece were considered a separate class of citizens because they were the only ones that had that privilege of connecting with the muses and hearing from them which would explain also why they were in such despair when their creativity was gone because it did mean that they had been abandoned by their news um but i think this is where it comes from wow i whether or not that that's the case i i i think that makes a lot of sense that it is in that sense that if it's gone it's just so fragile i gue
