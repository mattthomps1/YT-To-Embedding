 an egregious number of highlights okay so here you go you can see that it was is added um at 12 21 my local time is 12 22. so that's the append only relationship uh but now let's delete this and then if i rerun the sync it may take a second uh when it comes back in it won't have that new highlights added header divider because now it's a fresh note we basically have refreshed it so if you came in to here and you want to play around like maybe a lot of people don't want bullets for their highlights they want block quotes like i was using by default it will be a bullet um i already changed it to be a black quote you might like mess around with that delete the file resync it make sure it looks good and then when you're happy with it we re-import everything very cool metaverse all right yeah and there you can see it re re-exported fresh and now these are each individual block quotes rather than that divider so that's a pretty good example especially with articles i can see that being quite helpful as opposed to it depends what everyone's workflow is because with the book you're probably taking that you know those um you know concepts wrestling with them and then making some connections so then that's where i just loved and i'm fine with the the append where it goes below you know because that's actually it's it is more it's contextual in its own way it's saying well this was taken later and so if that's five years later that is greatly impactful about when you're trying to recall it you're kind of you're choosing to use your own personal chronological experience to recall info
