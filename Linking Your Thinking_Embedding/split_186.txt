we can use two points to remember a third point we knew these two points these two points and these two points and from them we can triangulate back into our past memories to recover lost knowledge i'm not sure if you've ever had a good friend or maybe it's your significant other and between the two of you you can recall that thing but if you were just by yourself you wouldn't have been able to that's an example of using two points to triangulate back into the past to remember a third point okay and the third power of triangulation is perhaps i don't know the most exciting when you really think about what it's doing for us in this world of linking our thinking is we can take our existing body of growing thoughts especially if we've externalized it into this note making space and we can use it to actually imagine a third point almost an intersection between the two and at these intersections at these crossroads between different ideas understandings that's where we're creating new insights and from new insights creating new value and that is how you can use two points to imagine a third point that means the better that you can triangulate the faster that you can move in the world of ideas if if you don't over collect and drown your system and noise if you don't over structure and suffocate your system in rigidity and if you don't over highlight and just leave no time for actually actively thinking then then you will have idea emergence you'll have an emergent system that encourages your ability to triangulate knowledge you will leverage these always present powers of triangu
