le you're synthesizing a book what is this book about but you're still talking about other people's work and so when I look back um to my uh creation process in the in the past 15 years this is what I usually do okay I have a big goal two goals I'm gonna figure things out so I'm gonna block my calendar two weeks in a row try to tackle everything let's say if I need to figure out what platform it is I'm gonna go into that and figure things out and then after that two weeks of time block I'll produce one Lego okay I'm gonna pick certain platform for example but at the same time I'm gonna be burned out exhausted and that's how the graph is uh going um um and so the previous uh 15 years the creation process is I have this mindset of you know everything needs to be finished so I can produce something I need to finish an article I need to finish reading the book I need to finish reading something I need to get a hundred percent of this thing I'm trying to make then I can produce something but then every time you can see just by consuming all this information I spend eighty percent of my time just on other people's stuff only 20 is actually producing things and then another again this is me lying door and then just in the floor and just just exhausted and through the lights Workshop what I learned is the system is really fluid and it really empowers me to do fluid thinking and so now I actually adopt the new mindset that certain things can be only one percent finish and certain things cannot be only five percent finished but then I'm already creating uh more stuff and so that's ki
