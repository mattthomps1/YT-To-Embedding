n't wanna i want this stuff to last a lifetime that's my answer for how long knowledge should last you see the your design way of thinking which i hope design is giving it enough credit because it it encapsulates quite a bit is what what's apparent to me is that it's allowing you to answer to ask to ask i should say the big questions big questions that have a lot of implications around them and then you start to to chew on how how to answer those implications there's a lot there's a lot to digest here but what's really standing out to me is that you care about your unique interpretation to the ideas you encounter that seems what is paramount um less so with sourcing um you know like you had said and i'm probably similar in that boat um is you know you're not so caught up on sourcing everything perfectly i'm trying to get better on that just you know to show that it is possible but i think my natural inclination is to do a little bit less because i want to get into why i care about it and then go in that direction the the the interesting thing though is when you actually are creating like that piece online and other things i would my my i guess my thesis here is that the work that you do outside of that piece it's it's like um you know when i was playing sports i would do the same repetition thousands and thousands of time edds they were called everyday drills and so i was drilling this into my muscle memory so in in the moment that mattered i did not have to think about it it came to you know it was just there and in the same way i think if we drill ideas by you know workin
