y i thought it was already working for i'm missing and what you're saying because i thought you know jes yes it works with with a javascript like query long form everything my method works but somebody was asking is it easy to just query like a normal data view query with show me every like bullet like show me every task of this nature and the answer is yes but you should not set your notes up the way that i set my notes up nice that makes sense i pioneered a thing that the developer had not anticipated which is a little bit my uh my brand that is cool but show me something cool about you nick i guess i could no i don't know i i really don't know um so maybe point me around or something how do you use yaml what do you do with yaml anything i i don't i have a couple notes out of a few thousand notes maybe two or more like 20 heavy ammo i know productivity wants to see scope so um yeah let's just do a little something here um i'll make these so data scopes um i'm for myself i'm saying are my various views viewports and um might be a little bit out of date but essentially if you go over here i do have not that many folders but i do have one called atlas now and i'm just kind of keeping track of my most important maps of content and my most important data scopes which are collections of data view queries so a data scope to me is a specific note that has a collection of queries that's what i think of as a data scope to think of different viewports yes data i want to see something else here data scope i use that um like for plugins for myself where i can look at different plugins
