be and then i you said you you you say that you do differentiate them but if i'm looking at our utopia is always boring i see type article so i'm curious where where is dataview pulling from the other types or how does it oh um okay so literally i am i created it so where did you see that maybe just keep going um i'm starting to interrupt if you keep going it'll answer itself so i i basically i created this this is this is metadata that i added okay article what it's for where it's at in terms of and then i i personally input a like when i last updated the status which for this one was today for most of these it was today um but so for example in the published ones i didn't do this for all of them so bear with me but this one i already published this on my website so i i publish it on this date it's ek is the market it's my personal website um and it's an article and then you can see i have these like hidden sort of things it was related to because it's an article but i still want the backlinks that's what comments are for i was so happy the day that we got comments i know that i i really really really need this ability um so yeah so i i i make this i decided this was the information i wanted to have access to there are other things that you can do with it okay so um you so you put that in each note and then you can then you can do something like uh data view yes and basically you're pulling all that information so could could you go back to that one um this i'm just a couple steps slow on this but if you go back to the note article no no it's just because i haven't used it
