 notes so i've i think i've shown you how i match i don't know if i've shown you how i match like multiple so one of the things that i do i can just show you really quick is when i'm synthesizing things um here we go a lot of the times if i'm reading a text i will have a thought and then i will see something else in the literature in the literature note that's like the same topic what i usually do is i will pull them out into just a statement and then all of the proofs okay and then i have the proof and this is why i i keep the big literature notes because i do this as i go and if you refractor later all of these links break oh interesting because they're going to headings and if you use the refractor plug-in it will just make it like just the title and the idea of going through every atomic note that i have and update it makes me want to die inside totally so that's that's that's the real reason i do it that way but um this is an example you can imagine how if i had come across two or three different things in the in the um the brian book about sailing like i could have put them together like oh yeah these these three things are all on the same topic let me put them over here so i do that a lot um and sometimes when i have questions they go into the questions file but relatively rarely i'm not actually going to put the wide attribute economy questions existing here i i know why they exist i was i was just messing with you i knew it it was a little bit messy yeah that's great but like as a thought experiment not just yeah no no no that's your and i and um i really appreciat
