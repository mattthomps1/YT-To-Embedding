ht that data in but this new system is so much better because you know two brackets you start typing it autofills the link and um it's just you know this is something that is not about idea development at all it's just about tracking a project and making sure that i'm on top of it and if somebody asks me six months later you know what did you do this or when did you do this i can just go look it up on my on my project page and then and it's good i love the project hub and i you're able to show me this um offline before we went on but one of the the cool things here that just what you just said out loud was that you had links to all these external uh programs yeah and but you have this project hub and and um so thinking about ways i'm just thinking about all the different external links that you know i could set up in my own project hubs yeah yeah the trick is to be picky about the apps you use make sure you use apps that are url link friendly and you're good you know like omnifocus lets you create a url link for any project perspective task or whatever the devin think allows you to create a url link for anything in the in the database if you want to use native files out of the finder you have to use an app called hook because hook allows you to create those but you know most you know good citizens in this kind of space do have url linking and so does um you know so does obsidian you know if i hit command u which i just did i don't know if you see the the note i got up there in the corner but i hit command u i just copy a link to any note in obsidian i just added a keyboard
