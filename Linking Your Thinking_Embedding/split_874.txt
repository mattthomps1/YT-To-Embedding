 are based on zettlecostin ideas methodology so like atomic notes written in your own words and linked to other notes uh the problem i was having is that i really wanted that higher level view so that's what you know you would be familiar with as a structure note when what i realized though is that i wasn't just indexing information into a structure note i was actually using the structure note as the the the main note where i spent my time and this is why i called a map of content because the map of content sir mlc serves three different purposes assembly uh collision development and uh unification where you unify it with the rest of your knowledge so in that way i was finding that the my work was done mostly in the map of content i was going there to sharpen ideas against each other to ground them together and then i was getting all these diamonds um and i thought it was a little crazy i didn't want to share it with the zelda costume forum because i didn't think that would fly too well and it seemed like what am i trying to do like add all this structure back in but i think for me the big realization was it's not just structure for one it's fluid structure it doesn't get in the way it's not rigid but two it's a way to take my thinking to another level because of how i'm arranging these notes how i'm working ideas fleshing them out creating ideas i've seen where the gaps are in arguments and then creating ideas from there so um hopefully that answers your question a little bit [Music] [Music] you
