your level of understanding of what i'm all about and you also start to understand paste layers a little bit so now what are we getting we're getting some sort of triangle forming where we can use what we know about nick to inform what we know about paste layers over more time over more time with myself and with this concept we have a greater understanding a clarity of both of me nick and of this concept called paste layers and that is the triangle that we're going for in in this metaphor is that we want to have a great understanding of both pace layers and of me and why is that so important because now when there's a new concept out there new concept x and perhaps you hear me talking about it then you already know what i'm about these days and you know what i think about pace layers so that gives you a good sense already of how you're going to approach concept x because if you didn't have these two dots to triangulate around then you wouldn't be able to make sense of it so very quickly with concept x you can pull it into a greater a more balanced triangle using me as the pivot point along with yourself the two known points to extrapolate and understand a third point and that's the first power of triangulation using two known points to understand a third point let's go into the second power the second power of triangulation is to use two points to remember a third point before i show you what that looks like on the next graphic this graphic isn't from me this is actually from a little-known lecture by someone called richard feynman and he is using this graphic to show that
