ttle notes and things but it wasn't quite coming together and there's this archive of like the linear version that i started with so similarly like i put together this like linear version that looks ultra polished like it could be a real thing but then it just sort of ends at a certain point and i think i shared that last time so i'm like oh let me put these in obsidian and like just pull them apart into different notes and do that and i thought i was going to do that and that didn't work like i didn't get anywhere and so then i did eventually i wrote this one which was like a brainstorm of like all the reasons right i've been trying to write about this like reasons why the open song project i worked on failed ultimately and i want to share sort of those lessons and help people sort of avoid some of those mistakes but also like take benefit of the good things we've figured out right because there's some good things we figured out and it's also a way this is like a very emotional thing so it's also in a way for me to like come to terms with it also so it's like a mixture of like journaling slash writing lessons for someone else so that's trying to get to something i can share publicly that's the whole goal here the whole goal here is sort of jumping back and forth here this organization made by our bump the website's made by bump we essentially shut down this site in 2014 so there's like this content here and we're paying for this and we have to stop paying for this eventually and so it's sort of this thing where like we gotta stop paying for our dropbox we gotta stop paying
