 make it individually referenceable in obsidian it's it's not obvious to us yet how we would go and we would turn every single highlight into its own file i mean it is technically feasible but if i did it i would have 36 000 files in my vault so we just need to think through like all right what do you name that right like what do you name the file for this highlight is it just like the book name and then like dash one and then dash two and it just kind of indexes so there are a lot of product questions there that aren't obvious to us but if there's enough demand and people have like ideas and use cases as to how it can unlock value we can definitely do it we did chat with a fellow who was using some plugin where you can like create like a block reference idea looks like that at the end and was basically backing into block level addressability within obsidian but i'm not enough of an obsidian expert to um teach that workflow yeah i would i would heartily recommend to go against making each highlight an atomic note i know that might replicate some functionality in outliner apps but i think in the obsidian infrastructure i don't think it'll be helpful um and again your your main way to recall or retrieve information is likely going to be from looking let's imagine it's a book going to the book and then you have your list there so when you're trying to find something you that's the best way to go about it if they're all individual notes with their uh i mean it's a mess for a few reasons not to say it can't be done everyone has a different you know here are the disclaimers every
