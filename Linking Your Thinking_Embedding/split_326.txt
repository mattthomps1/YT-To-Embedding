ly just shared this in today's newsletter a little piece of this so i can see that right here at a glance and then here's this is the actual course content and i created a separate note for each lesson and then i have those transcluded in here and ellen was just talking about admonition blocks and i was like wait what's that so i don't know if that's something that could be useful here but that definitely caught my attention since i've created these kinds of blocks um but what i love is that you know in the course platform that i use and i think a lot of the ones that are out there you know everything's broken up into like you can see one section or one lesson at a time and this way i can see all of it in one place but also be able to just click into one other thing and then who knows maybe this you know becomes a blog post or something and so there's lots of ways that i can see approaching things from different angles and yeah i have lost track of time so i think i'm gonna stop there as someone who also has a ton of ideas and content new and old i really get a lot out of seeing amy talk through her process of managing content hopefully this showcase gave you some inspiration on how you can manage all of your content what is something positive you took away from watching this showcase let us know in the comments below amy's showcase is the 11th showcase i've been able to share out of well over 100 from the linking your thinking workshops there are so many more people i hope to share with you because they show how personal the process of personal knowledge management can be
