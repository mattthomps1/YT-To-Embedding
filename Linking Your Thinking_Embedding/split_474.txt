e start with um maybe your organization on the left and then maybe take us eventually into daily notes or something okay um i uh i think that i am not when i watch your videos and i see how shallow a lot of the setups are people are using i feel like i'm doing it wrong but i actually go really deep with folder structure and obsidian and part of the reason is it's my escape hatch you know if for some reason obsidian broke i've got this nested group of markdown folders that i could do anything with and i like that also in the early days before they had an obsidian mobile app i was playing with some of the third-party text editors and if you didn't have your files in a folder structure it was really difficult to get to them and i have a lot of files in my database i think it's over 1500 now um the uh so i have structure um and just kind of the root level daily is all the daily stuff you know and that's daily notes and i create subfolders for each month so i can kind of just keep track of everything um dlr is a project i'm doing with my wife it's the disneyland resort field guide and that's just a youtube channel we made just because our kids are getting older and we want to have some fun and i'm taking some notes in there this one ideas i like this one um because there's a lot of concepts and kind of the root of my whole database is what i call sparky os and i have an operating system for myself i mean as dumb as that sounds um i feel like you know a lot of things that are important to me uh are floating around my brain if i write them down they suddenly become real and it all
