on't i don't do it interesting yeah since i like brought that up the other thing i could mention is so i thought that there would be a bunch of like um spin-off things i would write about after why do we interface and then then that's also when i started realizing that obsidian exists so here i had this idea that i could write about interfaces that press you know bias and extract and i haven't gone really far here and i think it's a bit of because i got overwhelmed of thinking i do need to start documenting everything i'm learning so it actually just became a dump of these links because again i'm sort of lazy and i don't want to come make all these different notes for all of these things and so it's just this really long thing which maybe it's better than the alternative of making 100 notes here it's just like one note and it's just like a a bunch of things that are maybe related to this topic if i ever come back to it i think what's more interesting is my own writing here like i wrote about how i feel like zoom oppresses you and i sort of reflected on that or um you know thinking about nostalgic interfaces um so that's i think where the real value comes from never really on on writing about how something exists but we'll see my my big question is how will this be for me how will obsidian be you know uh 50 years from now that's sort of what i end up writing in here is like it's sort of a critique of rome and how there's all these like rome believers and like rome believers believe in it for five years to me five years is useless five years doesn't get you anywhere like i do
