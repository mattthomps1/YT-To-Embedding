n the uh obsidian forum um discord channel 
they're using para they're doing a lot of project   management and that's truly the big point here 
hey if you're a project manager if that's the real   reason that you're using your notes your digital 
notes then you probably yeah try to do that whole   par approach however that's not my main audience 
and i hope that's not you to any i mean yeah sure   we all manage stuff what i want to manage what 
i want to develop where i want to spend my time   is with ideas with memories with making sense 
out of things that's the beauty of linking your   thinking now if you just want to manage people and 
manage projects then you know project management   can happen in obsidian it can happen in rome 
it can happen in these linked networking apps   but it's just not um where i'm going to put 
my attention and because of that para makes   zero sense for me um and what i'm trying to get at 
is you need to make your custom system when it's   based on links links change the game so we have 
to you know consider everything from a blank slate   what's going to work best and that blank slate 
for me is these are some folders honestly these   folders could change maybe i decide i don't really 
need workspaces because i'm linking my thoughts but if i have a business then i might have a 
workspace just for those notes because those   things are tend to tend to be more together so i 
hope that answers without getting into it too much you
