how we can deploy   maps and that is for our final lesson 
very excited to see you in that one   because we're going to see how we can manage 
action in the same area in the same pkm system   as knowledge and we are introducing spaces so 
if i twirl down the spaces folder i'm going to   make this even bigger you can see that there are 
two spaces within this folder life and work now   for me work i'd use an acronym called lyt for 
linking your thinking but what do you do for   work can you use it as an acronym there was a 
time where i had three spaces all at once i had   my life space we all had that one i also had 
my entertainment workspace when i was editing   and then i also had this one that was starting 
to become something the linking your thinking   space so you can have hobby spaces with 
workspaces with life spaces and that's kind   of the flexibility the beauty of a space 
you might be asking yourself right now   well is a space just an area is it just like 
a an area for projects what is a space exactly   well they're for any big area in your life 
and so i want to talk about that a little bit   because when i twirl one down i think it'll make 
a little bit more sense so i'm going to twirl down   the life space and here you can see how in each 
space we deploy maps and maps is an acronym   for mlcs areas projects and support notes so why 
not go back to our favorite note home note i want   you to see something here in our home note there's 
a project section so i can click on projects or i   can plan and prioritize my work life which is the 
light space for me
