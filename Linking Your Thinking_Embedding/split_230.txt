king new knowledge to existing knowledge am i building upon my past knowledge two questions there what about the organized phase do i have a place to put things am i able to scale my system so my knowledge compounds in value so these are you know subjective it's not like a yes or no but you have to really ask yourself these questions what about the develop phase this is where i think the least work is done our society for even with knowledge workers i think the le the least amount of work but the most joyful work is in the develop phase and that's where you start to make these connections because you're connecting ideas you're organizing and so really these are all kind of plain at the same time and i haven't said this earlier this isn't a linear process and it's not a step-by-step process a lot of these are tunes are instruments and they're playing in harmony with each other so when we're developing things it's typically because we're organizing them and that's typically because we're organizing them by maybe connecting them in certain ways so ask yourself am i making leaps of insights am i seeing the patterns am i colliding ideas and am i enjoying this that's a big one what about express okay so where where am i able to express myself where are you doing that are you at all are you stuck are you am i emotionally constipated if i share my thoughts will they be treated with respect that's an important one and if that is an issue where you're stuck it's going to be really difficult to want to do any other aspect of this so any of these areas are things that if you get stuck
