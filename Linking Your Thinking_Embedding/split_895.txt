hat i'm going to do with the light 
kit at this point it's been downloaded 4 200 plus   times but now with obsidian publish i can just 
have a public file that you can look at and refer   to at any time that you want to look a little bit 
more into hey how can we use maps of content also   you saw the sneak peek into how 
we can do a choose your adventure   linked sort of journey i'm really excited to see 
where this avenue goes there's a real art to it   what i showed you wasn't much of an art with the 
flow creation choose your adventure but what you   can do i'm excited for or if you're collaborating 
with other people obsidian publish can be your   online knowledge base it can be the directory 
where you go to get all that information same   thing if you do have clients that you're working 
with that can be a place of documentation where   you show everything that they need to know it's 
so quick to edit that's the real advantage here so who is obsidian publish really for i think 
we're going to find out but my guess is is for   people that don't know how to program who don't 
want to mess with websites what they want to do is   stay with the signal and not the noise and what 
is th what is the signal that's writing that's   creating that's linking that's connecting 
ideas and sharing them with other people   so in my estimation obsidian publish is really 
great because you don't have to worry about   anything to do with squarespace with wix with 
wordpress with all this html and these pages   you just worry with your offline obsidian vault 
then you select the files or
