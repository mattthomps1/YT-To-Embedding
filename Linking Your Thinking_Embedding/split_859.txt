ode let's see what this looks like   okay let's go check out what the actual linked 
reference looks like for comparison so it gave   us this little paragraph now if we open the 
link here's what i'm referencing and i'm in   preview mode here when i hop into edit mode notice 
what's at the very end so the program has added   this little hex code the six digit code with a 
carrot so that's the basics of a block reference   now let's look at other ways that it can be used 
a regular link to the main block would look like   this so what's the in edit mode if i just if i 
don't want to embed the block reference but if   i just want to link to it same thing i'm going to 
type in mental okay arrow down to it in the pop-up   and then i can hit carrot which is shift six and 
then i can go down to the thing that i want to   reference hit enter and boom there it is and so 
when i go into preview mode no preview because   i exploded it here but we can still link to it 
here click and there we go so i click back okay   so why does the carrot right now i have pulled up 
why does this convert autocomplete to a hashtag   and for my limited tech knowledge this is so 
every url that you create let's imagine that you   want to use obsidian publish all of these urls 
are maintained so there's complete consistency and   you've been able to use obsidian publish to block

block reference now let's just explore a couple   simple use cases i know that you'll have a lot 
yourself these are a couple
