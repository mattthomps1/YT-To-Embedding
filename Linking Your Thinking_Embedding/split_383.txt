s 27 so i'm just trying to do you know what are these kind of um invisible um real what am i trying to say invisible uh ratios that start to form that give us meaningful value and is it's just one data point with one data set but i think it's interesting so if we just take that out loud these are the things i'm interested in so basically 78 1708 divided by 27 so 63 articles for every domain i know they're linked in multiple ways and they're they're fluid but i'm just trying to think out loud how how these relationships form yeah i mean if you go to the about page on the site uh it'll actually show you the number of articles and there are 18 000 links between the articles and the 27 domains and and it's it's the first time that i visualized this i actually tried to visualize the entire data set all at once and and just my computer was like nope there are too many edges like when when you look at network graph theory and then you have the links and the edges um the way in which um d3 initially uses these these svg graphics for the web and 18 000 links for an svg in a browser window was not going to work now there's different ways you could visualize that but that's too much data you know like like we don't have the ability to really make meaning from that many data points that that aren't structured but the way when you can break it down and organize it now you can make meaning through these large data sets but in these individual chunks yeah yeah this is this is pretty wild we have five more minutes until we're at the hour mark so if you're reading through these do you see t
