that i just kind of   ran into that i thought were useful so if part 
one was the general use of block references in   obsidian now we're diving into some interesting 
use cases here's something that's kind of neat   about how obsidian is handling block references is 
you can actually choose what the the code is that   references it all you need to do is add a carrot 
so let's explain what i just said because that   didn't make sense while i said it if i go to let's 
go to sources and we're going to dive into let me   make this a little bit easier for you we're

of these paragraphs i want to focus on this   anterior cingulate cortex as a part of our brain 
that's involved in behavior regulation and it gets   exhausted when we use willpower so let's explore
