ks of empty notes but if i toggle this on i'm able to see them and see just how truly dense that subject really is and by toggling it off i don't get to crowd my pkm system with empty notes i really like that feature i love doing that i came into this workshop in an inquiry of how to process my own ideas organize my own notes and also create content more fluidly because before this i didn't really have a system and my system was just haphazard i told nick that i'd think about something and create something and it wasn't going as deeply as i'd like to be able to go so one of the frameworks that we learned was about file structure and hierarchy and this is how i've set mine up my approach to file structuring might be against best practice of fluid frameworks because it may look a little rigid there's only a few here and it's quite clean but i like it it brings me a lot of delight in seeing a place for everything and everything in its place and i don't have to go through a mess of endless scrolling to find something and i can neatly tuck away things based on its status or category i will tell you more about that in a minute one thing i find interesting is that emoji has its own ranking system and it's ranked higher than numerical ranking so for instance if i put numbers on these they would go to the bottom of this folder hierarchy list this produces some friction because i'd like to keep my journal up top but i don't want to sacrifice the aesthetics and put numbers on all the folders so i'm hoping we can add drag and drop features to obsidian so we can move our folder harkey t
