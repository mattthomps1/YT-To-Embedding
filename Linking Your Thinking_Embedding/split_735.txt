 unfolded now using that same hotkey let's unfold this pair this with swapping lines up and down now i can tell you when i hot keyed swap lines up and swap lines down a light bulb went off because suddenly i could really outline as fast as i wanted to basically as fast as i felt comfortable thinking so maybe that was like 30 miles per hour but to me it felt like i was blazing so here's how this works if i highlight this line i don't even have to highlight the line but if the cursor is here i've hotkeyed this to command 1 and command 2. so i'm going to going to hit command 1 it actually unfolds anything that's folded but then it's moving up and same thing and i'm hitting command two i'm going to put it right back make sure i go back to where it was pretty awesome right i mean this is really cool because i may have decided and i did while i was doing this i wanted to show you indent and out dent before i showed you something a little bit more advanced which is swapping lines swapping lines up and down so where i had this before i shared it with you is that it was like this i had swap lines up first but then i was like no i need to introduce indent out dent first so all i had to do was highlight everything and then hit my command 1 command 2 and then boom it's there i love swapping lines why because when you combine this with kind of some of the stuff that we do with mlcs where we're mapping the gaps we're shifting links so quickly it allows us to work in this really fluid flexible creative critical connective way that really unleashes i think what i would call our best thinki
