 some drop of water from the neverending information stream that they never have any time to actually drink from it these people sure have lots of notes lots of containers of thought it's just too bad they've never enjoyed any of them instead of just hoarding information like an addict what if we took just a bit of it a sliver of something that is interesting or meaningful and we chewed on it savored it digested it to mix metaphors what if we wrestled with it you know got to know it in such a way that we could explain it to a friend and they'd get it information hoarders can't explain the ideas they encounter they might be able to regurgitate them and they would even probably be rewarded for it in today's world with more digital followers but what a corrupt value system that is they are choosing surface level regurgitation that deprives them the joy that comes from thinking itself they are trading a nourished soul for applause okay i'm stepping off the soap box but if you've read books that meant a lot to you in the moment but now it feels like you have nothing to show for it if you have years of knowledge that you've either forgotten or that you're not growing in value over time it's quite possible you're in the trap of note taking instead of note making here's a simple test for you look at the notes you've taken not yesterday but two to three years ago how many of them have you continued to grow and linked to other ideas and experiences you've had if the answer is none or it sounds like i'm speaking a foreign language then you might benefit from learning how to make notes
