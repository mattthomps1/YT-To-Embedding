 on the website you need to load the font from somewhere if you're trying to use a different font i see so so fonts um that custom css set you did you you got rid of this side well both sides and you just got ready got rid of the header yep and the footers you could say now you you also showed how to showed us how to get rid of those the links to this page the link dimensions so is that easy to do i mean i'm going to rewatch the video to see how you did that but yeah it shouldn't be a lot of this stuff isn't too bad if you sort of know your way around css so sort of like find i think it was a markdown note published container backlinks like i i have enough familiarity with their css to know like that's pretty unique and you're seeing that it's like highlighting the right thing on both as i do that and i just did a display num which is my favorite css line to write i'm not that good with html and css but i know how to tweak css that's already there so from from that you can you know it's funny i would always open it up in something like bb edit or just another text editor but you can just edit on the fly apparently so that is a temporary edit so that's like a preview so i didn't edit my css that just edited it in browser and as soon as i refresh it it lost that edit gotcha yeah so it's like right click inspect brings up like uh it lets you live edit the css but it's not saving it anywhere yeah you would have to go into your text edit file i highly suggest getting visual codes and and searching through it through there um yeah it's free on microsoft visual code is that vs cod
