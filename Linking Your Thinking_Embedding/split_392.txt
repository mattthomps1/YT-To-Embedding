y all tap into text files that i can get access to and then they use the information that you can see in those text files in order to do some dynamic things which is really cool so if i tap the current book button and brie is going to get a shout out here i see bree in the chat if i tap current book it jumps right into like the current file i've got on the book that i'm reading and that's no big deal right that's not very complicated everybody knows or or it is pretty easy and we can talk about exactly how to do it if you want an ama to create a link to a specific file an obsidian but that's not actually what i'm doing if i tap the books and i tap book lists it actually draws from a specific text file from a list of books and then it gives me this dynamic list and you see at the top there is that first book that i had opened around a reading group that's the book representing free and uh the knowledge architectures book club that brie and i are running and then the rest of the list is a bunch of books that i've downloaded and got set up in devon think and if i tap any of those buttons i'm not going to do it right now but if i tap them it'll open that book right up in devon think and i can start reading right away and that dynamic list is actually generated straight from a text file from a file from a note i keep an obsidian it's the same thing is true for my projects list if i and i didn't do anything so this is where the demo might not go so perfectly go away okay okay so if i tap the projects list this is like this is i knew this would happen shortcuts has this weird glit
