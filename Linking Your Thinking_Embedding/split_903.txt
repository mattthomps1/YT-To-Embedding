gather them into a map of content 
and you start to form them but level four answers   your question which is where the maps link to each 
other so instead of notes linking to each other in   level two the maps are and then level five is 
the home note um yeah um do you use citations i do but i but for my purposes since i'm 
not you know creating academic work i'm less   rigorous with citations but it can be done 
and it would be you know the process is   very easy to accomplish uh through linking your 
thinking i.e tags okay so anthony had a couple   i think how to max use of tags i.e 
tags and links seem to do similar work   they do but tags like i've been trying to 
to articulate are weaker links they they   aren't like family links they are hey 
we're both interested in the same stuff   um we can talk more about that how do you use 
tags and breadcrumbs so david that's another one   that actually i'm glad you asked so the thing 
is this is my home note and i'm going to dive   into one of my top 10 or so home maps so i go to 
mindsets and then i'm going to and see here's that   breadcrumb i manually put in this i kept it as 
simple as possible it only goes one level up but   let me dive into concepts and see what happens 
to this now i'm in concepts now let me go to uda all right so once we get to the individual 
note i want the content to shine this is a   personal aesthetic you might be different i want 
the content to shine so then once we're in the   singular singular note level then i have the link 
at the bottom but once we get to a map of content   links go back t
