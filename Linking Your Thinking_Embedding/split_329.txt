 line having the right tool is essential it doesn't make the writing better necessarily but a bad tool will make it worse i've written using many different tools in the past paper notebooks words scrivener simple text files right monkey i've slowly been inching my way down the mark down line because if you see the last two are simple text files which are markdown friendly and right monkey is basically native markdown i like that it's totally mine totally movable and that it's future proof sure but the problem with all of the above is that they are all linear they can help me put down the end result but do they make me write any better no and then i saw the obsidian graph and i started playing with it and the graph started to grow the problem was i might have become too excited about the graph i wasn't doing much writing so but i had an idea i wanted to connect all of my fiction the stuff i've already written and the stuff i was still yet to write into one cohesive library where i could then make sense of it find new connections because writing isn't just writing even though that's the most difficult part of the process it's also the easiest in a sense once you get started you just well right but i have folders upon folders and notebooks upon notebooks of different ideas various connecting thoughts that aren't connected for example i have this trilogy of plays i've been working on and i had a great idea for an for an ending when i started in 2015. this was the idea part one part two part three it was all linear but then you write the first part and you have to change bits he
