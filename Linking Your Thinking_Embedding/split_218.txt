 if i want to go back home how can i accomplish that one of two ways right now if you notice there's actually home right here or i can go ahead and click that up link at the top that takes me home okay now we've covered folders basically in a broad broadest sense we've covered where tags exist on the page and we've started to get our hands a little dirty playing with links now what about that fourth relationship builder that i've been hinting at and that is a query and you can think of a query as a saved search let's look at one together so in the area of playing with ideas if i've captured if i've collected if i've made note of things that i found online that i think are interesting i can jump into this thing called the cooling pad and this is where i can see some of those new things right now see this little table this is a table that is looking searching into this folder called encounters and pulling out certain notes from these interior folders and it's displaying those results auto updating live for me right here so this is a query it's a saved search sometimes i like to refer to that as a data scope because it's a scope a lens that you can put on all of your notes to surface the ones that are important to you in this context what's the context here this is a cooling pad so i might come across something interesting online and i want to make note of it but then what do i do how do i end up connecting that to other knowledge well that's the next step so what i would do is i'd jump into one of these notes and i would connect it to another aspect of my knowledge management
