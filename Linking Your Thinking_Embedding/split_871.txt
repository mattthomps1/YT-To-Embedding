t it tags to in my opinion hey if you feel differently then just switch the order uh no harm no foul once we get to um oh i don't include this one that's it's a little bit too much for the light kit but once we get to a map then i like to put you know this backlink higher level map above it um these are these are personal preferences but now you know why i do it eric asks will i have access to the six week course forever eric yes you will not only that but the six-week course will change in the future and you will have access to that not only that but you won't just have access to it you'll be able to participate with with the new cohorts so this fall cohort is cohort two the first one was the summer cohort which was the private version so in this uh fall cohort you'll have access to that and then to all future iterations and improvement plus the community so anything that you have access to now you'll have access to in the future which i think is pretty awesome not only is it valuable as a knowledge base not only is it valuable well i should say it's valuable as a knowledge base but it's also super valuable as um being a part of a community and you know i find that the community out here it's so inspiring and there are days where i'm not feeling as productive but the community helps me sometimes get to that level where hey i got that energy back all right and so i think in the same manner that having the lifetime access is pretty powerful gustav gustav you ask a great question i'm happy to answer if you realize an moc is built on wrong assumptions how do you go about deali
