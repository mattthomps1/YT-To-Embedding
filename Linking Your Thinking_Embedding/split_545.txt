the from inductive perspective so it's like more bottom up so rather let's stay with the final version and throw everything away i will have just one note which is not even none of those which is just the summary of my results but for research you want to say okay in the first stage my raw data in the circle stage how did i analyze what are the results and the link with the original raw data and then stage two how the did i cluster those things how they relate to the original so all those things have links unfortunately i cannot show them at the moment because it's still not published i would like to but for the capstone i'll create at least an example so you so you'll be able to see how i do that um so yeah then i think that the idea of moocs or the emergence is like if you are doing deductive research it's good to start from moocs or something more high level then you go breaking down on what you're trying to do and the inductive is always good also good but keeping these links all the way up and then after having written everything marked down in obsidian then the last step so i say like i create a mooc with all the ideas per section of the paper that i want to write let's say introduction those are the ideas which was something i was talking yesterday and then after i can even write each section of the paper itself as different notes in obsidian and then i can transfer them into overleaf because overleaf uh for for those who use latex i don't use words i never write papers in words i'm against writing papers and words because formatting is really hard in word so in late
