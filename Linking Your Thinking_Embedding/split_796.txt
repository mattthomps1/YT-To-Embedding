 this screenshot and then you can save it send it to somebody and start a conversation that way or before you're going to bed you can review this visual mind map to kind of make sure that you're seeing whatever the context is the big thing that you're working on but i want to talk about my favorite the one that i can't live without and that is sliding panes so sliding panes are so cool as far as i know this was made popular by andy matushak whose evergreen notes and working with the garage door open has really inspired a whole community of personal knowledge management users including myself from that i was able to track down the use of sliding panes back to something called federated wiki which was by ward cunningham if anyone knows the details behind that or how we got these sliding panes in the first place i'm always interested in the the historical evolution of these concepts but that's for another time back in the community plug-in list sliding panes is the third most popular download and just to show you what that does real fast is this the thing i do all the time you hold shift and then you use the scroll wheel on your mouse and you can just scroll from the left to the right very very satisfying sliding panes adds a few cool features now we can see the vertical bars on both the left and the right and if i click on a note let's say the home note it'll auto open so that tells me that that note is now in focus i use sliding panes all the time because to me it mimics me sitting down on a rustic workbench with my index cards in front of me and i'm just shifting them aroun
