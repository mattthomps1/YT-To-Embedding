e that a lot i know replication is a problem so it's wild though to see all the citations that have been mentioned that easily uh it just this blows my mind by the way research rabbit you're pretty nice yeah and then so you get this you get what's called a dot bib file i don't know if you can see it i can see that okay so then literally all i do is i go into zotero and i one of these will let me import them so zotero i think being open source it's funny we have to install these plugins that seem to give it core functionality like better bib tech and um you know the other two at least better bibtex seems like it's a really should be baked into the core but you know for whatever reason it isn't it's open source though which is awesome that it's even a resource that's available okay so you found it is that it did it was it was in the file import like should i should have done that okay so not in here it's in my downloads boom so it'll make it into new collection which is useful and then uh this little pin means that the site the site key can't change so this is the site key that it gets imported with uh this is like what research rabbit like gave me you'll note that it's a different format than i used yeah uh oh which is fine that guy i'm gonna fix it but uh the reason for this is that like most people's site keys don't bother with the title it's like when you're writing a paper usually you just cite the author in the year because that's all you need in order to find it like this is sort of like what you would do in that little parentheses in i guess i don't know mla chicago w
