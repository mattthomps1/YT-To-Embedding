that you take the lowest areas and you build your goals around that okay so i've been trying for months to figure out how can i recreate this inside of obsidian and just the other day i had the realization that i could use a radar chart so i'm using the charts view plugin and this is what it looks like and i absolutely love this so it's just like a little spider web type graph you know based on this fun and recreation is the area i want to address i have the ratings here and then kind of some insights here for i won't spend a whole lot of time here but one of the things that really makes this click and i've applied this to just about every area of my life my wife and i ask these questions when we do our date nights is these three things right here what should i start doing stop doing and keep doing ask these questions and then give yourself a bunch of time to let your brain unravel them and figure them out uh it's really easy for my personality to just try to add one more thing add one more thing so start doing that's pretty easy i can usually find a big list of things that i want to do but i force myself every single time i do one of these personal retreats to find one thing to stop doing and that creates space and margin to take advantage of some other cool opportunities and then at the end you know the different goals that i'm going to set from from this so this is i mean nothing technically uh impressive about this other than the chart view but it's just a place in this list i find like taking these notes uh the day of inside of obsidian is is really fun i look forward
