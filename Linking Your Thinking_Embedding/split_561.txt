of it and then you'll have more space that you can force in for sense making it takes a little bit more effort to get into this note making stuff so you have to create the space for it you have to create the environment and hopefully you know do it enough times where you create the habit the way i look at it though is it's fun it's so much fun once you kind of feel comfortable with the tools and the technology and so then that starts to supplant like i don't really care to look at random articles that pocket recommended to me there was a point in my life where i did i'm past that like now i i see something out there and it i it's what i call signal and my god yeah let me let me learn more about that and then i'll figure out ways to have conversations engage with that material much sooner and you know the consumption there's nothing wrong with highlighting but when you're highlighting the highlights of the highlights of the highlights you're doing the wrong work at some point you have to and very quickly you need to transition from this note-taking methodology that too many of us are trapped in into recognizing that you are part of this conversation so um hopefully that gives some perspective on it we have to do both but it's just you need to create the space where you can do your no making your sense making efforts and then it becomes a self-fulfilling positive feedback loop that you just want to keep doing it are the question prompts the same with just words being different or do you have a bank of more prompt questions definitely have a bank so this yeah this is the warmi
