 ways and i showed 
that in the concept moc right this is just   a version of a focal zeddle these ideas are 
lined up one after another but then i do it in   a different way right here so hopefully that makes 
uh some light bulbs go off for full result users   all right thank you so much for everyone who's 
attended we're just going to keep going i can't   believe that everybody is here and they're still 
asking so many great questions is there a way to   auto populate the backlinks in a non eponymous 
note uh i.e any time concepts moc is used   the note referencing it auto populates 
the concepts mlc node oh okay so basically   is there a way that i don't have to manually 
put the note in um that's what backlinks do   so if you're in a rush and you don't have the 
time to actually place a new note in your moc   all you have to make sure i'm trying to find 
an example of where this might be the case   goals law yeah this is okay so who asked 
that question sarah so sarah your question   it's as simple as this go to your moc and 
look into the backlinks section i'm just   going to collapse them and then you say which 
of these notes have i not actually put into it manually put into this you can or you you don't 
have to but a good example is gold's law it's not   in this anywhere but in gold's law guess what i 
linked to the concept moc so that means in the   concept moc there is a backlink or a better better 
term for it is a linked mention right here awesome   all right so we're on to david's question we're about a quarter of the way through 
the questions yeah i'll answe
