 so i'm definitely going to try to incorporate that well i tried to break stuff out into snippets and like the palace in it like half the reason i published palestine in the first place was to make it easier for me to share stuff like that that's the reason i made the roundup too was because i would read something like somebody's going to ask me this later and i'm not going to have this link handy so now i can just send them to the like oh i think i mentioned that in last week's roundup you should go look if i'm like on the flyer on my phone or something because like i'll you know i'll walk the neighborhood with my son and i'm pushing him in the stroller and like i don't feel guilty being on my phone when i'm pushing him in the stroller when he's half asleep so i'll be trying to answer a couple questions but you know you know what's on the phone because of your roundup i um something that emerged in my pkm system is a more robust way to track plug-ins which is about time but now because of your roundup i'm like oh file tree alternative i will try this out at a later time and i can just put it there and feel good about that because i mean there's map edit quick add meta edit i mean there are so many extremely powerful apps i have one of those too yeah it's just crazy um and what's fun okay something that i just think is wild and fun about markdown is right now we can just go ahead and like find that file we can share it we can share it with everyone on this call and just boom like put it into the chat a markdown file um i actually will do that if that's okay with my obsidian
