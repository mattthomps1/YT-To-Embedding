n it on now final two let's look at appearance we have dark mode and we have light mode hopefully that didn't hurt your eyes too much we're going to explore themes in a upcoming video and also we're going to explore custom themes that will be pretty fun right now we won't touch them too much and finally in an upcoming video we're going to look at hotkeys so we can do a preview like that with a touch of a button and really see what this format might look like when it's outside of the edit mode of markdown so the settings are just another control panel on your hovercraft make a few round trips first before you try to fine tune your experience that way you know what you're looking for and what you're trying to accomplish but it's not the settings for translucency as cool as that is that's not what brought you to an app like obsidian it's the ability to write and think and link ideas like never before so make sure your best attention is going to the writing and the thinking and the linking and if you like this video next up we're going to cover custom themes dark mode light mode and all the things in between so you can customize that look we're not going to dwell on it because we want to write think and link but that doesn't mean that we can't create something that looks a lot of fun to use as always thank you so much for watching i hope you found this video useful if you did enjoy it maybe consider subscribing if you haven't already or leave a comment down below i look forward to seeing you in the next video [Music] [Music] you
