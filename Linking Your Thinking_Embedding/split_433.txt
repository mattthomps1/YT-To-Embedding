 of i hope you're using this already but one of those awesome awesome hot keys is command p which pulls up the command palette and that way you don't have to remember the command what was it how do i find sync and all you have to remember is read wise very easy to remember and then sync your data now so command p or on a windows it's is it alt control okay yeah awesome i uh i come from the world of finance where i got locked into microsoft excel so i'm still on a windows machine to be made fun of by everyone on our team but it is what it is i get it i get it yeah so you know that's all you need to do to get started with the plug-in it obviously has a lot more depth from there if you want to go in and customize things to your bespoke preferences uh which if you're using obsidian you probably are that kind of power user that has a specific format in mind and there's there's no way to anticipate all of them so i think the major feature of this export is this ability to use custom formatting by default it's toggled off but you can toggle it on and what you get is a whole templating engine where you can go and tweak a majority of the output so you can get this dialed into your own preferences uh it was very interesting when we we first shipped the private beta of this just to get initial feedback uh we had no idea that this whole data view plug-in like yaml front matter thing was a thing in obsidian but that was overwhelming feedback early on so for example if you use the dataview plug-in or you use the animal front matter you can come down to this section here you know and begi
