 my randomness what would we call that like deliberate serendipity if that is such a thing i think it is i think you can have that paradox be a real thing that has a real value so what might that look like well if we search for a term quote so just this tag for quote right this is all i have that's showing up in our library that we're looking at right now so what if i want to now open random note from search this is what this plugin does and immediately it takes me to a random note that has the hashtag quote in there somewhere here's another one and we can see right here that's quote showing up let's just do a couple more here's another one a best practices note back to the poem back to this one let's get a little bit more random all right so you know here's kind of a standard quote and we can dive into different sources now what was that hotkey again command p and then if i want to hit random because that's the only word i can think of oh smart random note and look these creators are brilliant they're innovative and even if it seems like such a small plugin even here we have three different options so instead of just random note from search which is what i was doing how about open a tagged random note now searching all of your tags like develop which is pretty cool i can hit submit and then say immediately whoa the concept of cause and effect which is huge and i've been kind of maybe not wanting to work on it well hey why not work on it now because of that serendipitous feeling so that's the smart random note by eric hull next on the list advanced tables by tony grassinger
