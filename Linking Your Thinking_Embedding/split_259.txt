toring then in this note then i can just quickly throw in i'm just going to make this not clean not trying to do anything impressive out there but i'll just throw in the link here and i know whenever i'm back in this note i have these associated notes ready for me to work into my broader understanding of this concept now that might seem pretty abstract when it's called accretion but if it's called my phd research paper and you're compiling all these associated sources and you know they're there and then when you incorporate them it's quite easy to if you wanted to just to get rid of the tag then this will automatically update it's no longer there i can put that back so just trying to show some ways to allow the technology to allow slow burns oh here i'll finish with this eleanor and then i swear i'm done look at okay one of these associated tags is um a little presentation so what we're doing is trying to build call cognitive scaffolding so your ideas can accrete why why do this and it doesn't just support our active thinking it supports our future thinking and i'll give you three metaphors i'm curious which one you'll like the most astrophysics so notes can accrete gravitationally in orbit around a topic like the dust around saturn in the rings and they grow in mass and gravity or we can choose fire notes are thrown into these slow burns until there's enough fuel for a fire to break out or seeds notes are seeds that you plant so you can cultivate them in the future or you can choose your own but there and then i go into some other things but yeah just wanted to share that
