ike that so i'll uh i'll open it up i suppose i know i was very focused towards one uh specific things so yeah any other questions beyond that i'm happy to answer as well seeing jeremy's process is greatly inspiring but why is it so special well besides the fascinating topic it's because jeremy shows us a blueprint on how to take any topic and generate tremendous value from exploring it so if you are tired of over consuming and under thinking and you know there's a better way this blueprint offers a way out of the noise and back to the signal it's note making not note taking thank you jeremy for showing how to raise your thinking game as a note maker as always there are so many more fascinating and inspiring people i hope to showcase with you because they show how personal the process of thinking and managing knowledge can be and they give us glimpses and illumination into how we can take our thinking games to the next level if you enjoyed this just like one of the comments below and i'll see you next time
