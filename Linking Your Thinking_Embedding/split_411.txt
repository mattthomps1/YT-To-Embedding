o maybe we need to go back there yeah feel free but it's a way devon think was 15 is about 15 years old now it's a really early mac app that was really powerful and it lets you put files in there you can treat it like a note manager similar to obsidian and rome and so on but you can uh drive one of the more recent updates that they've done in devon think three was to allow you to add custom metadata to individual files so you can say have a pdf and list metadata on top of the pdf about you know what kind of uh paper it is that as it fits into whatever the project you're currently working in so it allows some more complicated metadata management that obsidian i don't think will do anytime soon but outside of that you can store files in dev and think and you can store notes in it and you can use it as a full text search engine of all those things so it's quite powerful and to answer michael's question more simply devon think index is my obsidian folder so i can actually i published a plugin a couple months ago called devin link and it lets you open the current if you index your obsidian folder in devon think you can just use the scripts that i provided and the plugin to just like jump back and forth between them so the exact same files that are in obsidian are in devon think thank uh you know all of the developers who've come before us for making plain text files a thing and devon think therefore adds a bunch of functions that once in a while i tap into so i like hypsidian as the sort of quick moving easy to navigate and organize uh system and then devon think itself sits on
