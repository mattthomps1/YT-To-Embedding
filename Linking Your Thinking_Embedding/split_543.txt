rather than having text i have a big text then i put what is the pdf document so you are able to see the pdf here and then the original source my summary some analysis something that i was trying to do today actually i don't know it's true enough you know what is the idea of embedded queries okay i don't know why it's not working now it was working two hours ago maybe my query now is just i just look like this so basically what it does just showing the back link so you can see all the notes that have linked to this specific uh paper so i would like to have the extracting the piece here but so far is just like the words that appear in the context of the link but i can still pass the the mouse on that basically the same thing that they have in the backlinks but i think it's good at some point they say okay this source where where where it has been and what is it so basically you just put as you are you are putting common block or like code block and you just write query and then you write query as you would write in this so you can write you can use path file tags lines you can remove things i was trying for example i don't want to have my my daily journals for example so i just say i don't want anything with the tag journal so my daily journals don't appear anymore so maybe i don't want my sources as well so i can just that's what i was trying but it didn't work i don't know i don't want my source now it's working so it do not appear other papers because i all i tag them always source or you can say everything that is in i just want things that are in this there are in this
