use it's something i was curious about um but like traffic can you track traffic to uh like your publish um because if you can do that um that would be kind of fascinating to see um how much how many people go jump from one place to the other to get there okay um and then another thing is tracking between i'm wondering if you can check between pages if it's just one um static thing i i'm really curious about that you're talking about like obsidian publish right yes yeah i think that's one of the weaknesses of it is that you can't inject code at all like that would also solve the font issue um so i think in order to track that unless they build as a feature you need a place to basically inject code and as far as i understand i don't think you can do that yeah i do know that some sort of google analytics integration is is something they're working on i know it's a privacy thing that they're trying to figure out yeah because i think once i'm sure once you open open something up for code that that allows other things to be um accessed potentially so i think they're trying to work through that but this is a couple months old info at this point and you know we know how fast they work but i think they're they're supposed to have some sort of you know analytics because that's been a big request from you know published users and one of the things i will say the the beauty of obsidian publish and the reason why it is appealing to me even though maybe i i'm not sure if i'll use it or not is you don't get caught up in fiddling right here i filled with this so much uh and i'm happy with
