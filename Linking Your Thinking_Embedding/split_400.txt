e is not not a new one i think that doug albart was one of the famous computer scientists from a long time ago i think he was originally one of the progenitors of these these concepts but i think what people ran with as they started so there were examples of ites i think through the aegis through the last few decades but i think what they always did was they tried to overstructure i think they tried to you know give people this really complicated sort of interface where you had menus and lists and all sorts of different pieces and they failed to recognize that people have been creating ites since you know we started carving straight and stone we've been ex representing our thinking somewhere externally using that to inform and then using that to act and to shape the world around us so a very simple example might be like the uh i forget if it's a tablet or the stone of himmerabi one of the first pieces of policy ever written down right that was some king the king decided that the world should be a certain way the king represented his thinking on that in a given on a piece of stone you put that somewhere for where other people could see it and be informed by that policy and then people had to shape their actions and if you did certain things you got thrown on a river because people thought you're a witch so it wasn't necessarily a great sort of model necessarily for the world but it was an early instance of an information system and of and a thinking environment but it wasn't integrated in fact it might not have even been considered an environment what we're getting now are t
