it lives for sure and they never do put it on my desk and i'll put it away because i'm like a very like organized neat folder kind of person so if it's in my root it will like it me until i put it away you know i kind of work in that same way actually where um on my route that's where any new note will go and it's not like i have to file it because i'm just going to put it in the same exact folder like 99 times out of 100. um which i call umami which is like the full mouth feel like that hidden sense because it's vague enough that anything can go there like where most people call zettles or that but i just like to see it one more time before i put it there that's the only reason i do the inbox method just because i can see quickly all that stuff from the past week or the past month because sometimes i'm quite lazy and and i'll wait that whole time and then i'll just kind of scroll through back oh what were all these notes i made and then i'll just plop them in you know one folder but at least i get one more touch just one more touch to kind of solidify some of those notes before they get lost or before i you know maybe i wanted to do something but i don't need to process them for my use cases but yeah anyways keep going sorry i got distracted and i was um i was totally listening to you because you're right that's a good system but i was like oh no i actually want to organize this this way because it was in my root and bothering me so what i'm gonna say here is misuse of law makes people change laws that's a claim i made a claim good job me so i'll use that somewhere probabl
