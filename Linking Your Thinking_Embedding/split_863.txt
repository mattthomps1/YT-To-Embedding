daily note and now we see just   the two headers are referenced so hopefully you're 
getting a little bit of sen of a sense of how to   link out these different levels of reference you 
can link pages which is just that or we can go   to the header level and link to one of these or 
now we can go to the block level so it gives us   this great flexibility in what we can do almost 
too much sometimes but it does give us flexibility   in this case i'm going to block reference what 
giovanni said about how he uses obsidian it   autocompletes to hashtag one because remember i 
put in the carrot one so now if we go back to this   hit preview and we have the quote right here we 
can link back we can click this button and boom   we're looking exactly at what was referenced a 
couple extra notes on block reference we can do   global searches now so if you hit let's see 
anywhere let's go here and i go bracket bracket   instead of just hitting the caret once which 
is only searching this one file if i hit it   again now i'm searching all the blocks in 
my library which you know that's insane   but you can do it if you know exactly what you're 
looking for and same thing now with headers so we   actually have the header functionality as well 
and i can search all my headers that works a   little bit better for me just another interesting 
note in version 0.9.5 we can now search headers   outside of block reference there are two things 
in 0.9.5 that are also worth mentioning which   is now there's a command to if you're someone 
who uses a lot of uh checklists you know you   have that
