ird one i'm gonna say man search for meeting by victor frankl just because i feel this is one of those books that everybody should read at some point in their life viktor frankl is kind of known as the attitude guy and this is kind of his memoir of his experiences uh being in the concentration camps and uh in the very just to give you an idea of the quality of this guy in the introduction he talks about how he actually had obtained a research visa to flee the country because they knew that nazi germany was coming and they knew where they were going to end up and he recognized that a lot of the people that he lived with were not going to be able to get out he's like if they're going to have to go through this i'm going to go through go through this and it's so it's spread into these different parts uh the last part is kind of his experience with people who actually made it through and had a hard time readjusting because they couldn't they couldn't adjust their attitude they just held on to this resentment the bitter bitterness so many life lessons to be learned from from that one really really hard to read a lot of unspeakable evil things that he experienced but i feel like it's one of those books you gotta take your medicine and uh you're a better person for having gone through it can i admit to something here uh in high school uh i enjoyed that book so much especially the the last section not especially but in addition at the end he has his logo therapy where he talks about meaning through suffering and i know as an impressionable teenager i never returned it back to my en
