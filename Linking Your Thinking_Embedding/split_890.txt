it seems just like last week i was sharing 
with you the new graph features in obsidian   and the two ways that they slightly changed the 
game for me here i am again because obsidian   has just released obsidian publish which 
allows you to take your plain text files   hit a button and immediately your ideas are on the 
web and they're not just ideas on the web they're   your linked ideas they have the same structure as 
obsidian offline so again this is like a subtle   game changer and in the following video i'm 
going to show you how to take advantage of that   and at the very end i'm going to show you 
how you can start right now doing this   so hey join me in the following video i'm going to 
walk through obsidian publish for the first time   and we're going to see the different ways 
that we can start to apply this cool feature   and at the very end of the video i'm going to walk 
you through how you can activate this setting and   start publishing your linked ideas right now 
hey just in case you forgot i'm nick milo with   linking your thinking where we talk about the how 
and why of making meaningful notes let's dive in okay so let's check this thing out we start in 
the light kit right i'm going to publish all of   this online so what you do is you go to settings 
account excuse me about make sure hey version is   0.9.2 or higher and receive 
insider builds is activated   then you go to plug-in scroll all the way to the 
bottom and publish let's toggle this thing on so   you probably saw this airplane note appear let's 
click on it it loads so i did this one other
