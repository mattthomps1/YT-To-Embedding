anage knowledge and action in the digital age   but first let's look at how we got 
here starting with microsoft word   okay check out this map before i show you where 
microsoft word is on it let's talk about what   we're looking at this is the emphasis of knowledge 
management systems so those two tensions that we   were talking about between knowledge and action 
that's where they are on the map check them out   knowledge is at the top of the y-axis and then 
action is at the bottom and this is a tension   that we have to manage and then same thing with 
the x-axis over on the left we see folders over on   the right we see links this is another tension in 
the modern digital age that we're trying to figure   out how to manage and when it comes to knowledge 
and action that management that tension that   we felt it has has gone up for as long as we've 
possibly been alive as homo sapiens so it's really   interesting to check out that tension in the 
digital age and how that relates to folders and   links so let's hop in number one microsoft word 
came on the scene and think about what microsoft   word is doing it is a folder-based document 
system and it's mainly to manage knowledge   that's the intention behind it not many people are 
using microsoft word to get things done they're   not using microsoft word to link out to a million 
different documents that's just not what happens   so word goes up here what's next wikipedia so at 
the start of the 21st century wikipedia bursts   onto the scene and what do we have with it we have 
online links and what is wikipedia tryi
