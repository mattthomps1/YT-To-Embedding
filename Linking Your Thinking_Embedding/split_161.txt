thing that i really like that she did was that she had a color coding for the level of certainty that she had around the ideas so ideas that she was very confident about that she had lots of knowledge about and so that she was almost 100 sure we're going to end up somewhere in the book she those would have a certain color and then some that were more like questions things that she's heard in the conversation but maybe didn't have time to do her own research about wasn't completely sure about and where wasn't sure they would end up in in the book where on a different posted notes in terms of color and she could rewrite them on another color depending on how she felt about them but i really like that process takes a bit of space uh if you live with other people they may not like the new uh decor that you're putting in the living room but i really like that too but i think yeah and pen paper using uh an online tool your wall um it's really the the the idea is still the same right it's just being able to have those ideas to be able to move them and to link them together uh if your method accomplishes these things it works that really makes me want to have the big white board and do that um i i don't do it often enough i've been whenever things get hectic though i return more to paper than ever usually when i have to like plan big big things then i want to diagram and just have a map of physical map that i can take with me in my hand and work with it how have you used combinational creativity in your work you've done so much uh we probably you could talk about this for a day but
