 captors of a folder only system we don't abolish the folder but we work with it more broadly folders tags links and a fourth one we'll get to in just a little bit so first let's jump into the guiding values of pkm i want to direct your eye to a few different areas the first one though is we're going to cover be a joy to use so when you think about guiding values of pkm your digital library should number one be a joy to use and that serves two purposes one knowledge should be able to exist on its own not as a means to an end to accomplish a project or a task or something else that by itself is soulless it's a soulless form of efficiency and that is fine we all have to make a living but that being said they should be joyful and if they are joyful then all of a sudden that efficiency that productivity that we all crave also becomes joyful because we return back to the systems that manage all of those processes and when we do that we're able to use joy as a tool to return and to actually accomplish those things where that we're trying to accomplish pretty cool i think i'll let you read through the rest on your own time the next thing i want to point you to is something that's happening at the top and so this is sort of the top link you could call it an uplink you could call it the light link linking your thinking as a best practice what you'll see in the majority of the notes is some version of at least one uplink because when you make a note a best practice is to link it to another note when you make that connection it means that you have a higher likelihood of recalling that
