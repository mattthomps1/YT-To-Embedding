but i think you can't help but kind of through osmosis pick up a lot through all the conversations oops i'm gonna have to switch my camera i think a lot of the conversations and all that you you can't help but start to learn about the process so yeah how do students use the sense making in writing their thesis paper well i think that would tie into you know academic and research sense making a good good place to start is definitely zonka ahren's book how to take smart notes just to consider the bottom-up process of accumulating information that you can then make sense of i do think the one thing that you'll want to add to the process is considering where bottom up grabbing notes randomly making new notes connects to the top down structuring information in such a way that when it comes time to to write that phd dissertation whatever it might be master's thesis that you have both all the ingredients and kind of a structure in place to manage these ingredients so then you can start outputting something that we call middle out using things like maps of content maps of content to structure those notes a lot of gobbly goop there but i hope something there makes sense uh jose you had your digital hand raised as an student how can we balance between taking notes in in homeworks and stuff like that and taking the value to our boat for long term knowledge management i worked on this process after my formal education so keep that in mind with my answer and just use it as one dot on a map of dots that you have to decide for yourself but i would say this you have a curriculum and that c
