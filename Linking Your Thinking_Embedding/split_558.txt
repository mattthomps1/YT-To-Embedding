 to put you on the spot or make feel like you have to i can quickly share go for it please please share yeah i just focused on frankenstein because i had nothing wrong with revisiting the other concepts but um it was just the first thing that that grabbed me based on uh some discussions of helen and bob and your mention of mycelium networks throughout the course so some of the questions yeah i kind of started with the prompts but just it's basically a lot of stuff from conversations that just flooded into uh an idea of what what is life and i think so yeah reminds me a little bit about some themes on cybernetics cyborg culture that seem to be emerging a conversation with you about my clm networks actually led me to a quote that i quite liked by uh by donna haraway that talks about how the smallest unit of life is a relation and um and then that got me started thinking you know like what is life how does uh how do these thresholds you know what is a thought how does information and thought interact or uh sort of bridges the boundaries of life where where does that threshold of information and life you know when data takes form in life like maybe like a virus generating instructions in in our body and then producing a sort of material reality and then how that so how information becomes behavior and information becomes culture and and so on so forth and then it makes me think a little bit about what is thinking even yeah that's really cool to see i mean frankenstein it seems to do that and that's what i was hoping to do with those examples is we have something like you know b
