some potential here and as you'll see as i get into some other parts i'm really interested in seeing how i can you know repurpose and use things that i already have so i'm going to go back here [Music] i have a whole separate moc for my podcast just because that's you know something that has a lot of its own moving parts and i can see at a glance kind of where things are at i've got links to where i these things live elsewhere and then this is transcluded in here a separate note and i'm not sure if i'm going to keep it that way but basically this is where i'm tracking you know what i'm working on with the podcast from here i'm going to jump over to the collective moc the nomatopia collective actually was funny jonathan has collected in the name of his project also um the nomiatopia collective is my online community for nomads and expats and so there's a lot of moving pieces here as well and i'm going to show you a couple one so i have kind of a similar you know list of pulling in ideas down here for a long time i've struggled with how to keep track of you know articles and things that i'd like to share with the community so this is something i'm playing around with is pulling in this i created as a separate note and then tagged it to share in the collective and then this is the date the note was created because sometimes things are really timely this one not so much but you know if i don't share it within the next week or something not really any point so this i'm hoping will help me stay better you know tracking what i've been pulling together and whether it's been shared
