that i'm going to say is my best practice is workbench because a new workbench is a place to sort discard and rearrange stuff and maybe it becomes a map of content in mlc maybe it doesn't but so here we go we copied all that content and then boom we paste check this out isn't this awesome all of these all these amazing details so now if i if i'm in edit mode like i am i can just hit command as i'm hovering over and then i can see what's inside so what i want to do now though is i don't want to just keep all this and we'll get to the one caveat the thing that you have to be careful of when you use this tool and it's kind of we'll get there though in a second so the first thing is as i'm looking at these i might say okay these are big maps i really don't need those i don't want those so what am i trying to accomplish here and then you make your category and you say category you know z and then you decide let's say you really really don't need that many so you get to this point now another hotkey that i'll just throw out there but you can swap these lines so i have it programmed to option or alt up and down so whatever i'm on i can move four virtues up and down so this is a really quick way to develop some relational positioning right and that's one of the beauties of these higher order notes like maps of content now there's a reason i call this initial copy and pasting when we use this new feature copy search results there's a reason i use the tag workbench and not moc it's because this stuff can get really messy really fast so i'll give you the super fast example you know re
