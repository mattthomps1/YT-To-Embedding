ould actually resource and pull from all of those things and stay organized and actually reuse some things also so i'm going to show a couple different pieces here and i have these highlighted just so i would remember what i wanted to show you this is my marketing moc and um this i think actually let me jump down here first so i'm using data view to just pull in things that i've tagged so this is everything that's tagged with the marketing um idea and i noticed too that because i have the i'm not sure it's called preview hover or whatever is turned on so even these that are just daily notes if i hover over it i can scroll through here and find this is a terribly long daily note but um you know somewhere in there is the part of with the idea for marketing so i can find that fairly easily these are ideas i just dumped in here from another note making app um but it's helpful to know i now have a place i can find everything and i know where to put things this i'm super excited about because i think for a long time i was struggling with you know like using spreadsheets or something as a way to kind of keep track of where things were in the pipeline in terms of creating content but then also the writing was happening somewhere else so i've been doing this for the last few months and i'm really psyched to have a place where all of these things can live together just in the last few days i started to kind of fall out of favor with this idea of putting the date at the beginning of the title my idea was then at a glance i could see what had been published um but i don't know if that
