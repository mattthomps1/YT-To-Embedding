danielle asks how can i use obsidian and 
note taking for college i'm gonna put this   here does it work oh thank you um yeah well i 
kind of wish i was a college student right now   so i could apply a lot of these methods but 
long story short daniel you want to do this   whatever subject you are studying it's been 
decided for you the best thing you can do   is to pre-develop some mocs like a skeleton of of 
ideas that you can then a skeleton of big concepts   and then as you're in the lecture you start 
to fill in these concepts you branch out into   other notes as you need to but you have your 
mlc pre-built and and that's sort of magic um   so hey we have 10 minutes left i'm 
going to try to answer as many as i can   and then hopefully the zoom session continues   if it continues that's good but let's just 
plan for 10 minutes and see where we go when creating multiple notes from a book do you 
make an mlc for the book yes so that answers the   same question as the previous one is that i'll 
make yeah mlc for the book and then with each   chapter with each section whatever i might you 
know write my own notes and then make new notes   outside based on that i mean there's not one way 
to do this by the way um so it might change it   just depends on your situation carl asks how 
much does the workshop cost i think i answered   that like two two two minutes after you asked 
the question so hopefully you're good there   what are your rules of thumb if you find a 
vault that has so much information that other   vaults may be needed to prevent file size issues
