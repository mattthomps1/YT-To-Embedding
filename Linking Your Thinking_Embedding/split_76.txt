ll you what it was but I have this hotkeyed to command D on a Mac or Ctrl D on Windows what's so nice about that is no matter where I am I get overwhelmed all I need to know is I can hit command D and immediately go back to my daily note in this case I might be keeping a daily log or I might have the three big rocks that I want to accomplish or I just want to journal something maybe I'm doing interstitial journaling or it's the end of the day and I just kind of want to reflect on how everything went there are plenty of reasons to open a daily note now what I also find useful and where periodic notes comes in so handy is that you can actually jump between daily notes now in the past if you were to jump between let's say today's date and go to the ninth it would create this note to the 10th first which was kind of annoying but in this case let's just close everything really fast now if I open today's daily note I used hotkey if I jump I can hit a different hotkey and immediately jump back to the ninth or I can jump forward to the 11th or I can jump forward to the 24th so look at that and I can jump all the way back to the fourth too so being able to quickly when you think to yourself oh what what day was it well I don't quite know but it was around this area then you can just go ahead and click in that area using the plugging or the calendar plugin and then using the periodic notes plugin you can quickly jump through different notes now for that I use the plugins the commands that I've chosen are the semicolon and the apostrophe they're next to each other on the keyboard so i
