 the folder that   you want to publish you hit the button and 
boom your ideas your thoughts are out there   you make revisions you make changes great that's 
fine hit the button boom those changes are pushed   online and then after a few minutes those those 
revisions are out there so it's pretty wild   you might be wondering but is it private hey 
i'm not a programmer i'm not a coder but what   i've heard reassures me that your notes are 
still private they're still protected and   if you have any doubt at all you take the notes 
that you want to publish online which obviously   aren't private if you want to publish them online 
and then you just move them to a separate vault   that's being triple safe i'm not that concerned 
so i'm just going to select the notes that i   need to uh that are the light kit and i can 
just hit publish on that but the question of   is it safe the answers that i've heard reassure 
me but because i'm not the most technical person   i can't explain them to you right now so 
there'll be more information that comes out   and like i promised at the top of the video 
i want to share with you how you can start   sharing your ideas with the world right 
now not just ideas but your linked   ideas your linked thoughts so what 
we do is we go to obsidian.md pricing   and that'll take us to this window and what 
you want to do if you're able to and you want   it right now is support the team i'm not a part 
of the team i just think the team is amazing and   i love supporting them i love what obsidian has 
done for me so if you can and you want to take
