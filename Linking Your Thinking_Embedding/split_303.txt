 our way down strikethroughs look like this so let's see i can go here and strike through right there and you already saw the highlight which i'm pretty excited about it actually glows it pops it's a highlight but it's also not in your face so i think there's a good balance there and yeah we can see the command palette if we type here i think that looks pretty gorgeous if you're asking me and then here we can do the same thing so a lot of great action i must say going back and that's light mode i'm going to repeat myself just a little bit but if nothing else i hope you get some ideas about how you can use color in a digital format to help deepen your sense making and maybe even encourage a fuller broader form of thinking you can use color to help you with lateral thinking to make leaps of insights between different domains and genres a good example of that is if you're just talking notes and all of a sudden i make a link we can see how this link stands out here there's so much that you can do with color and i hope this gave you a few ideas and i'm so excited to continue playing around using obsidian but with this amazing theme and if you get half the joy i get out of this then i think you're going to have a lot of fun oh and because this is a first take i keep forgetting to show you things but if you look at this what i want you to notice is the tighter line spacing oh you know when the line spacing is so tall we can't see all the information we want to and it actually impedes our own ability to make sense of the text in front of us if you enjoyed this video if you enjoyed
