e cases which i eventually want to ask you about you said something interesting that you use project in obsidian you use it mainly for project management which was surprising to me because you're such a thinker and i thought you know where are you developing ideas or maybe you're just referring to it differently because it seems like you're you're taking information you're crafting it you're working with it you're refactoring it to make sense of things so i'm guess is it just semantics are you like where are you doing your sense making if not in something like obsidian honestly i think it's something that it's just something that i'm bad at do you know anybody running any courses on exactly how to you know practice i know it's yeah it's uh it's just a lack of attention to it so far i've been when i started using these tools i was looking for a way of managing my projects and you know this is this is the tyranny of classification what i'm calling a project is actually a deliverable that is a thought product arguably of a bunch of ideas that i'm putting together and so uh it's maybe an example of of what i was just talking about but i still have a habit of writing big pieces and that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is like i have i'll have a project note and the project note will contain the kind of writing that i'm doing and the tasks associated with it and the other relevant projects and the thought products that are going into it and what i like about that is i used to use you know i've used every task manager out there and then i used to use every writing app out
