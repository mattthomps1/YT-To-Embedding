ng and you know their views towards the open web yeah good points there you bring up another one too about the the intention of how something should be read which is a whole nother like you know what is art how should be consumed makes me think of netflix they i think they added the feature half a year a year ago to watch content at 2x speed like up to 2x and you know if it's a feature film it's by christopher nolan i don't think there are any christopher nolan films on netflix but the point being is that's somebody who really wants to make sure that you experience his work in the theater and all that and so so that yeah the interesting side conversation that we won't go down that rabbit hole because eric asks a great question from a data protection standpoint is all the read wise data pass-through from example kindle to the end user or is it stored in read-wise read-wise's managed platform it's stored in read-wise the thing we didn't go into is kind of the core functionality of readwise which is this whole daily review so we really have two value props uh the one value prop that we focused on entirely during this conversation is kind of our zapier syncing value prop where we import from a variety of sources and then we export to a variety of destinations but the core functionality is this like daily review where it becomes this very beneficial habit that people find very easy to maintain in contrast to like zettle casting or slip boxing or whatever where you know it's kind of like a new year's resolution everyone rushes in like oh this is gonna be my year and change it you
