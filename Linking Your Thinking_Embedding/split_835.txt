 fast so my apologies there but yeah i would just quote it and i might just do that or i might even go just a step further and just do wiki because in theory i'd have all my thoughts right here as i was going and then this just gives me a little bit of a reference um yeah i would do something like that and i would try to keep it about this short and i would and i would probably like rewrite this or make sure that they're the best quotes that i think are are the most important so that very good point though that when in doubt add those those quotations oh and you're also right too what you mentioned is you can just as easily do this i just find that sometimes then i have to you know it's just a markdown thing where you might have to do it for a couple other notes but it certainly looks nice that way so especially when you you're writing in line so i actually would say that what you showed there is a pretty good approach so both quotes and um the quote syntax would be the ideal option only if i want the quote to stand out though i'll put that little caveat on it because you know i think that kind of gets to where where i want to focus a lot is not just to heavily link everything where it's unreadable but figure out ways we're telling stories so each note should really direct the the viewer's eye to where you want the the eye to go and when i say viewer i mean your future self and any outside audience so it's like do i want for for my theme do i want wiki to stand out this much well i obviously i don't but so i'm fine with just the quotes so that's another little aesthetic con
