industry so it's very sort of you know this is yeah this is the serious stuff and that's not really what i want my showcase to be about because as you'll see i really try to make my vault my friend and that means that as a friend you know it's not just work but it's play as well so the projects the courses and my writing they all feature like past present and future things that i'm working on have worked on will work on the who am i not yeah this is a it's like a gel of all trades note for anything me related that i want or need to keep track of life by date i'm not really sure i'm gonna keep i'll quickly just open it so this is based on how i or maybe i can show you this instead so when i do my daily journaling i kind of link by the year by the month of the year by the month itself and then also by the date of the year but like by the day of the year so i like this because i'm able to kind of click into it and you know see what i was doing on previous days or months or whatever so the life by date is kind of the catch-all for this but i don't think i'm gonna keep it but i'm parking it here and then if there's uptake you know whatever let's see it's a complete work in progress every day of the year so uh the deep dives yeah this is really uh i like obsessing over things like really obsessing over something for a short period of time and then i move on and so this is kind of here because this is the latest thing that i'm obsessed by and then once i'm done with it for the moment it goes into this wake the hungry bear and that's where it hibernates and waits for me to love it
