 allows those neurons to connect a little bit easier a little bit more efficiently and that's what allows us to remember and recall even better so yeah we just go through and we kind of improve the notes as we go what's note star for the sake of it we'll just say that note star is under the people tag and now that i have a few i can click this one and see that we have never note note star and victor frankl so that's another way that we can kind of use those weak relationship builders tags to our benefit now this is one list and finally we're going to change these up which is a tiny bit of formatting but you can see that this is an auto numbering list as well so this is another form of the same thing and here we have it these six most important keys to typing and markdown the final note i want to make on this that's really important is there's no formatting bar at the top why is that it's because for text that we create the most important thing is the idea that we have that we want to get on page that we can externalize that we can articulate that we can put into a place that we can then return to and grow so formatting is out of the way and we can focus on the most important value creating activity which is actually thinking writing out those ideas and expanding those thoughts i hope you found this video useful see markdown really isn't that intimidating if you have these six keys at your disposal you'll be off to the races and riding fast and efficiently just like your mind works so if you like this video if you're not already subscribed please subscribe below next in line
