cific opinionated 
ideas to these stars like anti-fragility that is   a concept that i did not come up with uh naseem 
tele came up with it um so i just kind of want to   honor that with my own commentary but then i can 
have an evergreen note that says something like   anti-fragility is a smart way of thinking it's a 
bad example but you see how that then becomes the   evergreen note that links to the concept which 
is more of this like pillar and so in that way   um my library of ideas isn't all atomic notes 
because i don't want that to be the case but i   want some to be opinionated and i want some to be 
um i shouldn't say that they i'll take that back   my library is a hybrid of evergreen 
notes with very clear statements   and then concept notes or manual notes right 
that are less opinionated but have information   that is important more like fact like and then 
opinion like that's kind of the two two extremes   are you familiar with christopher alexander's 
a pattern language it represents proto-pkm for   vernacular oh cool well i'm i'm familiar with 
the title and that's it so i'll throw that in   there do you have access to a markdown exporter 
i'm concerned about my links being future proof   um well see the beauty of those links i 
don't have access to an exporter and again   i think other people can answer that question 
better than i can because i'm not too concerned   with exporting importing right now but as to 
the pattern length of pattern language i've   heard about that book recently so it's 
probably something i'd like to read to   understand more and
