tion acceleration you know think of the large hadron collider in switzerland it is smashing you know subatomic atomic particles together some of them merge to form a new note so to speak others fall away and these are these discarded notes but what's happening with that those type of collisions is this massive um massive work massive progress and i just find that this is the best way to go to get that done at the fastest rate at the funnest rate at the rate that has the most flow so if we go back to what are the steps to creating a map of content there are two ways you allow ideas to emerge naturally and then eventually you get to the point where you want to start i called the mental squeeze point you know you get to this mental squeeze point where you're about to become overwhelmed by whatever notes that you're working with and you need a way to work with them uh where you can offload the cognitive burden and this is perfect because i really want to add i'm going to come back to this note but right now i just want to make sure i get chunking in here because mental squeeze point and chunking are tightly related and why not let's just see what happens here let's publish this change and then eventually we'll we'll check it out in a couple minutes on the obsidian publish feature which is just so cool the point being though is when you're in your notes as you start to reach the mental squeeze point that's when you create a map of content or you know what you want to talk about already you have a preconceived idea right like um we want to get away from that all the time but ther
