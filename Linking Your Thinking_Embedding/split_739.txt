to a numbered list let's see what that looks like one two three four five quite nice right now for the most part i prefer just to not number unless it's very explicitly needed also side note before you tell me that these features existed already in vim mode or in emacs or in whatever app that's fine that's cool what i want to show though is a simple way to do it for simple people who don't know the advanced stuff and that very much includes me i hope this helps you become a super fast masterful outliner and left-handed keyboard ninja and that takes us two additional features so let's unfold additional features and it's the export to pdf functionality which is pretty cool it keeps your theme so if we're in the cybertron theme i already did two exports and the first one will export my colors which i don't quite recommend so i'm going to show you how if you are using cybertron or anything that's sort of dark mode you might not get the best results so what i would prefer to do with this exact file like hey you want to share this with somebody you want feedback you want to keep a pdf copy whatever it is send it through email so let's go to appearance really quick and i actually have adam and i'm going to go light mode this is a theme by cognizi let's see if i can pull it up yeah it's right there so this is a nice one if you want to export to pdf on the fly so i just quickly change it and then under more options here it is right at the bottom export to pdf and let's go ahead and export i'm going to save it on the desktop and just give it three now let's see what we have i guess i
