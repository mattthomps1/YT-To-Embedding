 trying to get at here 
is i've just created manually a block reference   that is actually descriptive it's descriptive 
to what it's showing me and maybe i put an a at   the end just to kind of give it some arbitrary 
numbering system so this is pretty cool and it   is now a block reference why that's important 
is because i decided years later oh i want to   reference this in my note on bean and flow not the 
best example but you kind of get it so now if i'm   in this note i want to look at this title which 
is source and i give it a date and all that jazz   so let me explode because i want to embed this 
bracket bracket it saw that i was looking at this   so i can put this oh put that note in 
there i'm going to backspace hit a carrot   and now what was that in neurocognitive okay so if 
i go down in neurocognitive terms cool if we look   at what that reference was cognitive robinson 
2010 a and we can see it's referenced here   so if i go to preview mode we can actually 
preview this and if i click on the link   it goes directly to that block and that's that's 
one of the powers of block reference so if you're   used to my other videos this is way more advanced 
you don't need to use this feature but it does   provide some value if you know what you're 
doing and you really need to reference blocks   i want to show a little bit more of a paired 
down example of referencing blocks using obsidian   just today i was on twitter and i found something 
kind of cool so i want to open up something i saw   giovanni okay not that but giovanni said something 
about block reference
