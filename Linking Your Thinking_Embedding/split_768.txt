r me to talk about it but this this book is a phenomenal book and there again it's like each chapter is just like you know two four pages most maybe one page for a lot of them i think there's a few reasons why i like it because it's it's very readable but it's also a lot more approachable for me as a writer that's not very good at writing books to try and imagine that i might be able to write a book one day if i if i keep it like that one of the things i was struck by andy mathusa's website is i you know was interesting and fascinating and and mesmerizing but i always had the sense that i had to wander around which is is good and cool and everything but what i like about you what you're doing here is with this micro book is you're you're going to invite me into your website and you're going to curate your links like nick has been saying and you're going to guide my attention and and give me a course and path through what you're trying to say and do and i i think this is very impressive i i i really like what i see here thanks appreciate it yeah i think i think andy's uh site is really cool i don't think it's trying to even be a cohesive thing i think that's the beauty of it his i think this is a little different i think i might do other projects that are like that about like design in general but this is to me uh a case study so how would you do a case study case studies tend to be linear in their sense but if it was linear i would maybe lose this you know ability to like um capture like this insight like a pretty bold claim like why you should always charge money for chari
