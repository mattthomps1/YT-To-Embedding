e in this list the quote is it's very handy i like it because i was actually working on something completely unrelated i was working on taking notes about art so when i i was writing a story about the cult of valor i could describe them your turn nick that's good oh my god well thank you all right well thanks you can pass it over my way and uh i'll share my bit and then we'll kind of see where we're at we're starting to get a little bit of that buzzing again it's it's crazy so um maybe i'll share my bit and then we'll do after hours on zoom for whoever else is yeah sounds good okay so in the meantime we're um there's a link so we're not going to use this link yet but i'm just going to get it into the chat so it's started or dan if you're able to the un unseen dan he's here though if you can throw that in the live stream chat the zoom link we'll get there eventually i'll just um i'll start sharing a little bit uh okay so i don't okay when talking about note making a lot of people are not familiar with the term or don't know where to start so my goal was to provide a helpful framework for them and that framework became the seven cs of note making and so do i i won't use this all the time but this was an example that kind of seemed to make a lot of sense so actually using accretion for this um this is a word i wanted to learn more about and so the first c is you create the note and then it's created and so then c2 is the connect this is the first thing i want to do with any concept in my world and it's going to be different for other people but it's just to make the connection
