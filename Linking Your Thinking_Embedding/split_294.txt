he price so there's not really that much to show yet so okay so let's do the walk through words so if i click in here the first thing i do is i can start with any word that catches my so let's do genius and so okay now i have a quote and this is you know any quote that has caught my attention and when i put it in here i link every word so as you can see a lot of these words are not yet linked and that's part of the deliciousness because the next time that i'm in here then i can you know put a new quote for that word but then one of them at least is and so i can click into that one now i have a new quote and i have all these other links a lot of which have not been fold so i can just kind of keep on clicking into different links with different quotes it's not the the key here is not really saving quotes i do that elsewhere and it's not really to understand kind of why i care about this note right now or you know why is it significant to me it's like an open invitation and anything can happen here and this is what i what i really love about this all right so let's forgot to pin the other one so let's just go way back so i'm here and then the last thing is i'll take you on this weird little ride and like i said you know really just to emphasize this is so much about play for me if i start wondering kind of why i do this and what the what the meaning and the reason is then i lose the charm so this is usually something i i just have this random sentence that pops into my head and then i'll make a note and if i click into this note like as you can tell this was like fridge poetry
