aybe grandfathered it out but they have this my mind node service where you can publish it to the web so this is an iframe the other alternative to this would just be to export it as a pdf and drop that in i've done that in the past as well but i do like these uh these iframes so this allows me to zoom in zoom out and i can basically like navigate through this like i would um here is the uh the luminal thinking chart that i was telling you about you know reality the unknowable your experience is based on top of that your attention that's really what you're able to focus on just a random step from this that stuck with me we can we can take in 11 million bits of information per second but the amount of information we can focus on is like 50 bits it's like a crazy small percentage so that's basically what everything else is built off of your theories your judgments your beliefs and then at the top is the the bubble of belief and kind of how you change that is you you test things and you embrace the the learning loop he explains that a little bit down here you know your needs your beliefs drive your actions drive your results you get feedback and then you just kind of rinse and repeat so uh this is what the mind node file looks like and this is the the basis here so then i publish this as an iframe another thing you can do with my node is you can export as a markdown file so i export as markdown and then i just copy paste that markdown throw notes on the top of it and then the rest of this is just straight out of mind node so it's all broken down by the different level headers
