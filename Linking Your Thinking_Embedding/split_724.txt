get to recipes later but a couple of of different ways i could i could use my library and i like having actionable paths yeah then getting getting more into the meat of it this is like the growing ideas section so a lot of it for me is is about faith um is yeah about meditating on scripture and understanding the implications so yeah i've i have a couple of overview notes here a couple of big mocs like i pulled put the bible into obsidian yeah so in here of all of the books of the bible can jump straight into one but also have an overview kind of on on each books and like big big impactful events that i can get linked to in other ways yet so just to show that like here's all of it put in and i can always navigate to the next chapter but also jump back to the overview note um and then there here are a couple of of different mocs on on different topics yeah both like more abstract but also quite practical thinking about i'm married uh even being 22 thinking about marriage and and living that out well a quick question for you joshua yeah when you were in genesis i was just curious how you were handling the the verses on the left-hand side yes that's how you handle the categorization yeah so that's um that's just some some custom css and so these are all um like heading six headers yeah i think thanks for jumping in there and to make reading a bit easier i yeah i pulled it to the side so if i was to create a new note um i could quite easily just reference um a specific scripture and then put a verse in and if i want to embed that it seems a bit in the way yeah so what is great u
