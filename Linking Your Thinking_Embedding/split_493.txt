 finder whether i'm using hook or devin think and then i have what's the reason this is on hold you know and i'm saying you know waiting on form and um and i've got more yaml forms i'll show you in just a minute but so i add those links to it and i add an explanation and then if i go back to the kanban board i can see here you know what why is this on hold well it's on hold because i'm waiting on the form you know i don't even need to open it up and then over on this i'm not going to use this because like i said there's some private stuff in here but this if i click this button it goes to the omnifocus project i click this button it goes to the devon thing folder if i click this it goes to the air table where me and the editor are working and this goes to the base camp for me and the team working on this field guide and so i can get in addition to jumping to the obsidian node i can also get to all those external links right from the kanban board and the way i do that is with this kanban plug-in if you scroll to the bottom you've got the ability to add metadata and i just added separate metadata keys for all of those things error table basecamp why is it on hold and then if as long as i add them to the yaml it shows up there and i know i'm kind of like rushing through this but you get the idea yeah i love what you're doing there with the the apparently kanban board i'm going to have to i'm going to say it incorrectly a lot and yeah apparently it's a japanese word yeah yeah it is i know it's japanese but i didn't yeah thank you for that actually i mentioned it i can't think o
