scholarly academic world um don't get me wrong there's some overlap there but we're not really experts on reference managers so i can't really speak to that okay um yeah that's a tough one i know there are some other tools and the good news is with obsidian's architecture you can use things like the plug-in md notes by argentina and some other things and get a good zotero workflow going on for those pdfs that's great here's here's a good one that i was kind of wondering myself also from david thoughts on using a web plug-in highlighter versus highlights in instapaper so for example let's this new exciting read-wise plug-in versus highlighting in instapaper really comes down to personal preference i've met people who supporters of the open web are pretty dogmatic like oh the author made the page a certain way now obviously this person is writing on sub stack so it's not like a whole lot of craft went into shaping how this looks but there are people who believe that it's like betraying the author somehow to pull the content off and read it in a in a different app so it really comes down to personal preference i personally prefer reading in a very consistent calm space you know that tries to remove distractions and just focuses on the actual reading experience that's my personal preference but i mean just like the way people use obsidian and you know some people want to use dashes for bullets other people want to use asterisks some people want block quotes i think i think this is in the same vein it really comes down to the person what their workflow is like what they're readi
