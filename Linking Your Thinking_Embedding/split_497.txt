rita is is you know you may never get there but so long as you're trying you know that's that's the game yeah what a beautiful word so much from the yeah i know i i love it and it's like if you if you really dove into my database you'd see that it's all over the place because that that concept is for me that that's the cornerstone of everything you know and there's something to that too of those cornerstone concepts in a database like this that you always refer to yeah part of the part of the operating system um yeah for me for me that one's like a positive feedback loop or just thinking about how um whatever you focus on is the kind of wherever your focus attention goes is wherever meaning will grow and uh i'm always fascinated by that that concept another question let's see here do you consider obsidian sync to be safe for your law practice data yeah i pay for the end-to-end encryption so it's using my date my password and nothing is stored on cloud storage uh you know a mistake you make is they'll do end in encryption but then they'll store it on icloud or dropbox and that's a mistake but everything is stored locally and i have indian encryption enabled i think it's it's more secure than what most people do you know um that's the way to do it and just finding out so yeah that's also known as zero knowledge um only which is like only you it depends on where you're saving your your information but only you have access and no one from obsidian can touch it yeah yeah i mean because i i do think like i was talking to someone recently who said i'm using nd encryption but then
