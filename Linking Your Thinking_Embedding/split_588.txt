ke my those 500 word articles and my synthesized longer articles and my story like that it's not like i'm not synthesizing things into my own words i just don't want to lose these source notes yeah so i organize them that way and it kind of organize them in a vln a very long note right and then and then from there you can pull them out here's a related question how often are you using the zettalyzer for a source node is it just once because if you do it more than once will you end up with duplicate files duplicate files if you break out atomic notes more than once that's a great question i only do it once um my my flow is once i pull it in i have this dumps thing and then once i am done processing these i like i i'm done processing it and anything that i go back and add i can do manually like this analyzer is to save me time it's not the only way to do it it's just you're automating when you're doing a whole file because you don't need to automate if you're not doing a whole file that makes sense yeah yeah so you make your your 20 or so whatever it is one hundred headers heading three and then use it allies once yeah so some of these files are longer than others like i have i i was working on this one last night because city walls is the upcoming topic for the newsletter and i don't have time to do it when i'm trying to prepare for two newsletter articles and also my kid is sick and also i have this zoom planned so i just didn't have time to do it right i'll fix it later so much so much what theme are you using i think it was answered in the chat but um if you just want to
