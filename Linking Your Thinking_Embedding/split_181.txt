ople born five decades before you they're old enough to have already made their greatest contributions most likely and those contributions have been vetted as long as you've been alive on the other side they are young enough to come from the same cultural understanding meaning you are able to see how they lived their life in a cultural context at least somewhat similar to your own so we're not going all the way back into the ancient times we're just going back five decades okay let's talk about how to use the five decade rule take a moment right now and think about the big idea influencers in your life make a quick list five people maybe more but at least five now go online and find out what year they were born now let me say this clearly it is a big big problem if everyone you learn from is in their 20s the best and most enriching way to learn is to learn from people of all ages from every decade and the majority of those people you learn from should already be dead i know that might sound a little morose but that's the way it has to be if you want to have a full mouth feel of experience of flavors of umami when it comes to how you are learning because if you're only learning from people stuck in one decade you're cutting yourself off to so much more okay rant over let's go back to the exercise let's imagine by now you've identified your idea grandparents and you've grabbed their birth year my next question to you is do you notice any patterns emerging what do you notice let's keep going after this exercise take a moment and recognize the extra questions you started asking
