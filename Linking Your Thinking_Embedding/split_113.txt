horizontally duplicating and just basically moving around let's go back to this big canvas how do I see everything again you tell me oh that's right it's shift what is it shift one okay now we see everything I need to zoom in a little bit though so how am I doing this well let's go to secret Maneuvers and find out these are the secret Maneuvers to supercharge your canvas experience the first one to know is being able to zoom in and out so on Mac I'm going to hold command down and then use the mouse scroll wheel to scroll around I use this all the time this is this is where it's at you combine this with the next one scroll horizontally hold down shift and then scroll with the scroll wheel that's going to move you left and right okay this works in Google Sheets this works in a lot of different apps these are the secret Maneuvers that work in all sorts of universal applications and if you get comfortable with them when you try out something new you'll be surprised to recognize that if it's well designed you can probably do these things already and so what you learn here can benefit you in countless situations yet to occur so now let's just combine these two and see how that feels this is how I always navigate I'm always thinking about having a hand on a thumb on the command control and I'm zooming this way and then if I want to move over to the right I hold down shift and then I use that scroll wheel and then I shift over this way I go over here I zoom in I zoom in over here I scroll I zoom in and out beautiful stuff okay now depending on how you use things you can move around
