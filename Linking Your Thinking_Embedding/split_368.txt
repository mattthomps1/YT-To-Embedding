ant to get beyond those limitations and and those exclusions and how one way you could do this is now you're at feminist philosophy of law and now you can get into the critical theories and all of these different articles now we can get into this is going to be on about ableism and now we can get into the part of the encyclopedia where we're getting into the critical theories about the tradition that we're both exploring but also now we're critiquing and that's i think one of the things that makes the stanford encyclopedia such a powerful tool because i think they're very aware of now who has been excluded and now they're building out additional sections so there's much more information on non-western philosophy and chinese philosophy on feminism and we can then start to learn from within the tradition those critiques of the condition itself yeah absolutely which one is much needed everyone needs to have a voice at the table that's how those diverse perspectives allow us all to be more enriched and and two it's i think i forgot my two so i'll go to three which is i'm so happy that these topics are being included especially going back to another point you know i'd run into somebody like uh mencius a chinese philosopher i'm like that this person is saying things and i think plato's probably said similar things but i don't quite you know i'm an amateur here i don't quite understand how to make that link and and this is i'm so excited to jump back into it explore that that person from long long ago mencius and and understand you know where he falls into this this great conversa
