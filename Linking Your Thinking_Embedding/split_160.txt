t took a lot longer than it should have to get there from my opinion and and that i think ties in overall to something that i think we're not completely there yet which is the visuals so we have all these ideas and a lot of them are still text based i mean i'm in obsidian every day and that's 90 text so how can we use combinational creativity in a more visual way we have the the concept map that's probably the main one but are there others that you've seen so i would say that the concept map would be probably the most effective one simplest one as well because you could use tools like cmap but and there are many many other tools if you just look it up but uh you can also do it on paper it doesn't require any complicated tools to actually do it a pen and a piece of paper you could be on the bus on the plane or wherever and just pull your notebook and very quickly start mapping a concept and combining ideas together to do a mini brainstorm on your own that's very easy um one of my friends who wrote a book she did it uh with post-it notes on her wall uh and it uh it looks really nice too it looks a little bit crazy a little bit like in in those um murder movies kind of scene where the detective is trying to find out who committed the crime but um she basically has a white board and she put the post-it notes on them and then she links the positive notes by just writing on the whiteboard and she can just erase the lines when she wants to move stuff around she can just kind of pull post-it notes together that allows her also to play with different colors for different themes some
