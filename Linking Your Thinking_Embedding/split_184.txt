[Music] triangulation is using two known points to find a third point now this is actually something that we do all of the time every version of sense making that we can possibly do every moment of every day involves us triangulating information triangulation if we could personify it it would say i'm the ultimate sense-making mechanism to both the known and the unknown let's break that apart there are three powers to this thing that we do every moment of every day and that is we use what we know to make sense of stuff number two we use what we know to remember old stuff and last we use what we know to actually create new stuff that kind of sounds almost self-explanatory but it's pretty profound once we break it down just a little bit more so if we were going to rephrase this it would be we use two points to understand a third point we can use two points to remember a third point and we can use two points that we do know to imagine a third point so now let's go into examples visually to see what this might look like the first power of triangulation is that we can use two points to understand a third point so what does that look like exactly let's see this is you you've met me i'm nick over here and i'm this circle and i'm saying things about paste layers but if both of those things me and the term paste layers are new to you then from your perspective there's not much of a triangle and so you can't really get a sense of depth or any real perspective on these two things me and pace layers however as you become more comfortable with me i become more clear to you and closer to
