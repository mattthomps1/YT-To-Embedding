but i think the problem is when um people will read a blinkist review and then oh i read the book no you had a conversation with somebody who read the book but you didn't have a conversation with the actual author so there's a lot that you're you're missing there just to hop in on your metaphor it's almost like you're going to the gym and you're watching somebody else work out yeah i mean it's more value than that but um but it's maybe closer to that yeah yeah i got really offended one time with somebody who i've been trying to get to read books for a very long time is like hey this person is making me read this book uh what do you think of the blinkist summary of this and i'm like get that out of here you reread the book [Laughter] nice uh somebody had asked about obsidian versus ulysses because i had done the the core set the sweet setup for ulysses ulysses is a is a really really good writing app there are always been a couple things about it that have bugged me one is the non-standard markdown that was the thing that bugged me about rome research too it doesn't have standard markdown so i've kind of always been looking for a replacement for ulysses for myself and i've been able to make obsidian be that for me however if you're just looking for a writing app ulysses is amazing especially with it being part of set app i can't recommend setup enough it's a 10 a month service that gives you access to a whole bunch of really killer mac and ios apps my note is part of said app ulysses is on there and then like 200 other really great apps it's kind of like netflix for quality
