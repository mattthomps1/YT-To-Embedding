 love it but if nothing else maybe you got a few ideas from cecilia's amazing design i mean look at these gradients on the headers i mean i just fall in love with that i guess the last thing we could do is go into outline mode and then maybe let's jump down into some of the formatting that's also present here so if you look at the different headers you can see how we can derive meaning understand exactly where we are by the color of a header what is emphasis what does italics look like we have we're using this yellow bold is the purple and then you can combine and have a white there if you look at the lists here's what a bullet looks like and this is what's wild nowadays is we can just edit right here so there's nothing holding us back from editing and looking at something so gorgeous we look at block quotes we talked about these already inline quotes we have backticks that we can see if we click on this actual note the tasks if you're somebody that uses tasks a lot it's not typically me but what's so nice is we can just enter start typing and then we can hit our little hotkey and doesn't that look pretty nice so we worked a lot on check boxes to make sure that they would be appealing and not really get in the way where it feels like something you have to complete but it's there for those who really want to use it tables is a little messy but if we go into a preview mode and jump back down into tables you can see a little bit of the formatting here so the headers really stand out and then we can see that there's a little bit of a difference between each different row moving
