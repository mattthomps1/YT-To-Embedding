d people mapping you can do this process too here's how it looks one day you can be note making notes on people that are of interest to you for whatever reason it is one day i was doing that for carl sagan and i decided let's try to put people together make them this tag people and then the p here stands for prominent so this is essentially prominent people in science so i decided to do that just a simple tag there and then organize by birth date i thought this might be cool because at this point i had a lot of dots in my map a lot of different people a lot of different dates and i finally wanted to understand a little bit more about when they were born and what that meant so what i did was i created a new note called prominent people we're going to open prominent people up now here we are prominent people so what i did here is i wanted to see these people in various ways to pull out some insights so you're going to see 87 people apparently that i've given a tag prominent people sorted by the date they were born roughly right we don't know everything for sure and let's check out where carl sagan is i'm really curious here one of my favorite thinkers on my mount rushmore of favorite thinkers 1934. so as i looked at this i was like oh well who else is on 1930. no way mihai and that is when the epiphany struck me there's something special here there's something special about 1934. what is that well it's roughly five decades a little bit more than that before i was born therefore there's something interesting here just out of curiosity who else is born around this window of tim
