verything relates to one another versus i don't know another way to write the only other ways i've seen of writing are like file folder ones and so i'm just very intrigued and impressed by how you built that out and you built out a system to to do that for for fiction writing i'm kind of excited to see if i can maybe like replicate something like that for a very short story thank you and well that i also thank you everyone and thank you nick and thank you for the discussions i i used to work a lot with files and folders because that pretty much was all we had even though scrivener does wiki linking it's a little cumbersome to use so i only ever used it when it was really relevant so i was working with files and folders and it was horribly messy and it needed a lot of work and also anxiety because i i yeah i can i can share this on the on the top of my desk i have words from elizabeth george uh which i have uh which are taken from her old journals and it goes this way uh the writing i'm scared i have so much to work to do i'm feeling afraid i'm feeling as if i don't have an adequate handle of this on the story that's the truth i don't but what i'm going to do with this i'm going to move the novel forward by five pages every day and i honestly don't know a writer who doesn't feel like this and because it really feels like we never have an adequate handle on the story which is kind of normal some extent because it's creativity and we don't really fully know where we're going but i always thought gosh would there finally be a way to just have everything in my head a little more
