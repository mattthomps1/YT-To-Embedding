ng better and you know i want it the the term mac power users is aspirational i mean i want listeners to come on to the show saying hey i'd like to be a mac power user and listen and become more of a mac power user and the um the whole idea from the show from the get-go was we're going to pick one subject each week and we're going to dive deep on it or we're going to bring in a guest who dives deep on something and get his or her story for the audience and and katie you know katie my co-host at the time joked with me she's like we're only going to get 10 episodes out of this show because we're going to run out of stuff and i felt like that's fine you know if we only get 10 episodes so long as there are 10 great episodes and now we're we just rounded the corner on episode 600 so we had more than katie thought but the uh so it's kind of you know the idea was to make something that would give a listener a lot of good information you know in a short amount of time i mean my my real goal with that show is anybody who listens to it learns at least one thing they can use in every episode and uh that's how i measure success you know when i hear from a listener who says oh i always get something good out of it i feel like i'm doing a good job if people feel like they're not getting enough out of it if we ever hit the day that people just consistently tell me they're not learning anything new i'm gonna shut it down you know so um but so far we're doing good well that's one of the things that i definitely appreciate about you among other things of course but it's just your clarity tha
