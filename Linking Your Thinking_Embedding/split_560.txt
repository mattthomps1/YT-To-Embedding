ot externalize it into a note then it came up in a conversation that i mentioned this thing to somebody else i was like wow this really means something to me let me like throw it into a note and then really start to link it to these things that it reminds me of and then you can start building this personal custom meaning through that process so i hope that answers your question this is my first time i use a sense making zoom session is this a thing well it is now we've done these for the the linking and thinking workshop and it's my favorite activity as i'll say no one else is i'm aware of is doing things like this obviously you can see where it's rough around the edges with technology but we're able to do quite a bit we're able to create an environment that forces forces you draws you into it and forces you to think for yourself and not passively consume so how are we doing that well we're doing it through note making so just kind of like broad umbrella sense making is what we do every moment of our lives just by living you know we can't help ourselves note making is a very specific exercise that can help accelerate and improve how we make sense of things so yeah we do these during the workshop and i'll probably i don't know maybe sometime next year i'll do another one just publicly but it's also something people can just do on their own too there's no reason not to how do you find balance between consumption and sense making sessions everybody by and large if i'm going to generalize in today's society they're consuming too much so whatever amount you're consuming do less
