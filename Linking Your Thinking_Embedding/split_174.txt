e the decade in many ways i think going into the 20s i know i'm simplifying things going into the 20s though i think it's really ideas around combinational creativity and being able to cross disciplines and genres and our thinking that way because we have systematic problems to solve a yolanda gibb who's speaking later would classify these as wicked problems we're not going to solve them if we're only focused on this particular tiny field we need people who can make the connections who can combine and talk to each other in combinational ways so all of us here have almost responsibility to practice this a couple more and feel free to play off i don't ever mean to jump in um danny hatcher who is speaking on friday what does creativity mean what does it look like feel like how do you identify it this is such a big question i feel like people have spent thousands of years trying to answer that question um i'll i'll give it a try uh i don't pretend this is the definitive answer to such a big question um but to me and sorry if this is going to sound very um philosophical but to me creativity is when i felt most alive in the sense that i'm not just here existing and passively experiencing whatever is going on around me it's when i feel like an like an active maker of the world i feel like i'm shaping the world around me i'm contributing something and the world is slightly different for me being in it versus than me not being in it so it's very philosophical but at its core i think it's about being an actor in the world whatever that looks like to you whatever you create whatever y
