ent ideas tie to this one idea and it contextualizes those ideas to this idea specifically so even if i made this article about or this note about spatial awareness and digital environments without thinking about this mystical computation i was actually thinking about a different topic it ended up living here and then i gave context to why that note in particular lives here and then on top of that i've just got a bunch of links to source notes that i've taken down here so i'm a very source driven person i start most things start for me by reading something listening to something having a conversation with somebody that's where i find a lot of the ideas emerge from for me um and the way i end up generating these notes up here is just by seeing something in two or three places and then naming it and saying like okay i saw this in this article i talked about this in this conversation and i heard about this in this video whatever i'll give that thing that i'm noticing a name and then sort of start to clip out the pieces of those lit notes so for instance down here we've got sources so these are all the source materials that were useful to me and thinking about this but instead of just linking to the source note like here's a documentary i watched called all watched over by machines of loving grace and i have notes on it and i could pull up this this is kind of a shorter one it's just got headings for each of the main ideas that i encountered watching this documentary and then a couple links out in there to other places some of my own thoughts written out in here too just mixed
