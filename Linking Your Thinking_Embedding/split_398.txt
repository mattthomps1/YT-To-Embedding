it really funny when pkm started to get popular sort of again really when became started to get popular about a few years ago it wasn't being informed by information systems and yet there's a whole bunch of study out there on exactly how we represent worlds in computers in information systems and that's kind of why what i'm drawing on those those areas of scholarship and and practice and this might seem silly but again i'm just going to reiterate that when you have a thought when you have a thought in your head and i realize my writing is not great so hopefully this sort of takes you back to like a college math professor and you're trying to scrutinize the board to figure out what exactly that x really represents but when you have a thought in your brain it's a little sketch of a brain and then you actually put it down on paper or on digital paper and in an ite in what we're calling an integrated thinking environment integrated thinking environment well you're no longer actually talking about that thought it's a representation of that thought and that representation interacts with the thought that you you had yourself and so you never have the same thought twice you never represent the same thought twice because the thought's no longer the same and neither are you right and i think a lot of what nick has been practicing and linking your thinking and with maps of content and so on is actually kind of about this it's about representing and breaking down the thinking that you're doing and then letting that thinking provide you a map right and that's the inform angle over here
