and and then we'll have whatever data we think is relevant and then we can have it as part of that table at the bottom okay i'm just talking out loud no no yeah i mean that's that's sort of how i envision it in my head basically how i have over here like where this is a tag with where i'm gonna put it it should be possible the only thing is my lit notes are really long and like yaml has to be at the top so i don't know i i haven't really dug into it there there is definitely potential there particularly with like real atomic notes like this is the downside of doing it my way is that if you have actual like just like so like you would do it with your this stuff right like i could have this have some kind of metadata at the top that's like and i have a text expander don't mind me it's hilariously hard to make this okay there we go my my dash dash turns into an m dash and i really need to change that um okay so we would want this to be tag right and then what we would do is to be processed you want some kind of dataview thing that does that's not it there we go okay that's so we want some kind of data view thing that does this where yeah okay gotcha i'm actually like i don't really use yaml a lot so we're gonna pretend that's right okay actually just for the sake of simplicity yes keep it in quotes okay okay so we don't have a current status we just want a table we're just to do it real easy for now that should theoretically work hey it worked look at that except we actually want to list look at that look at me i did that first time and look it like doesn't even look weird rig
