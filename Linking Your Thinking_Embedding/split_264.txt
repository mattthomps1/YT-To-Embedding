e this approach versus um versus a tag so i use this where you use tags and like i suspect we have basically opposite systems um because all of my tags are this is something i need to do i need to go edit this i need to expand this i need to plan out that novel i need to turn this story stem into a story oh golly that's not the button i wanted to push i need to turn this into a newsletter i need to write this article i need to write this article of this type right like my my tags are very specific to my workflow i basically use them as a kanban board and this is like i need to finish reading these and then i have like 211 notes i haven't processed because i've been very busy um and like my ultimate goal is to have zero tags like every one of these tags is something i haven't done whereas your tags are almost more like categorical i think in nature they perform all sorts of things including like the example i was showing which is more categorical or classifying something and i don't think there's a wrong way to use tags some people use tags instead of folders i think that's fine um but because i used tags this way i needed a different way to query all of my outstanding questions and i needed a different way to query all of my ideas that i could follow up on that aren't quite i should turn this into a newsletter like it's just a different oh golly that's that's a that's a unwise query i meant to do that query so so i guess why this why this seems like it could work or i could find some uses for myself is one of the things i try to always leverage when i can is autocomplete be
