kind of like i don't know the funnel where everything pinches down and then it enters into the new library so that stuff is waiting for me to process but it's still accessible and that's that was this one so i just need to kind of make sure that that data is is appropriate for entry um so i have a like i would say i have three volts i have the light kit i've my working notes and then i have my archived notes that i'm slowly bringing in and i prefer just to be down to two just this public kit and my personal kit if i could help it although for the workshop we're going to have a vault which is how we're all connected as people and talk topically it's it's really going to be a cool way to for us to get to know each other and to understand like oh who else used a space photo in their introductory message on in the chat group and kind of understand like where our interests are aligned daily task management is a burden to me can the light kit help mark asks you know it can but this is where i'm i'll i'll be straight with you is i try my best to keep task management and idea management separate and uh and i think it's because task management has low basically no long-term value and idea management does we can grow these ideas we can evolve just like growing a human being who is growing throughout life we we gain texture and flavor and that's why the idea management resonates and why i don't want to muddy that with with task management so it it's my it's my feeling that you don't want one app to rule them all you want to keep obsidian separate from or i should say whatever you're u
