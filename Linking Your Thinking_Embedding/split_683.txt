ll said yeah i haven't heard that before but but you know now i have a note that i will totally be able to find again if i'm ever looking for article and blog ideas i have i use dataview to uh help myself with that so i have an index that i don't have to manually update because as much as you know maps of context indexes are interesting and useful i don't enjoy manually updating them so i use the new dataview plugin and it just pulls every single article that i have filed as a article what it's for where i'm gonna put it for i write for a couple of different outlets or you know aspire to write for a couple of different outlets but i also use the backlinks pane um we probably should dig in a little bit to data view sure data is great yeah i am curious to see how that's being used i know it's powerful that's all i know fair i i like i only just started using it i actually i had to get help today but uh you know you do your part for the community and the community helps you that's right that's the economy yes it really is so this is how dataview works let's just make that go away for now you have a bunch of yaml metadata at the top you you set this however you want it so i personally chose to differentiate between articles blog posts and some other thing i don't even remember what it was and then the reason i do that is because for world building magazine i write blog posts and articles and they're like a totally different format mostly i write articles that are actually blog posts but in that particular niche thing i they're different so okay make this however you want it to
