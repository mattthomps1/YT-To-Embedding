in the world and we decide say his his work is often around uh crowdsourcing and observational crowdsourcing so say you've got this project where you're looking at birds in the wild and you have this system that lets people see a bird and then they say that's a robin and so they say i saw a robin but uh what if that robin was sick you know or what if it for some reason was doing a dance and uh it's the first time ever that you've you've seen a robin do a dance that any ecologist in the world has seen a robin do a dance well your system only lets people say i saw robin so you're actually missing all these interesting attributes of the observation you're actually missing all these ideas that because you're structuring too early you are losing them and so if we decide that a note about a book is to contain these kinds of information then we aren't necessarily thinking about all the other pieces of information it might contain and there's a there's a tension there there's an issue yeah yeah to that point i guess personally what what i attempt to do is you know so bottom up doesn't allow for that structure when we make notes and we have we put whatever's currently relevant to us about an idea and we capture it into this container but then as that stuff starts to come together then we want to apply some structure and hopefully it's a little bit earned at that point and if that structure can remain fluid then it allows conversations to continue and you we can take it in different directions theoretically and practically i think that is a working model depending on some people's us
