ake new notes out of other things that i actually found find helpful um so that's kind of how how i process books yeah i i like using using templates for different things so yeah i have like specific metadata for for books i put in the author the year published and then like when i read it in a month so i can compile that into the months um and have a couple of of other templates on different inputs or outputs just to keep things um standardized and i think like doing it right in obsidian the most straightforward way um is probably just like having if i have my book template here every time i create a new book note just i'm copying that um in there if you don't want to work with with templates or explainers but yeah you guys are going to get get more into that as a bit of a last fun thing um i started putting a couple of recipes in in obsidian yeah so i can browse that by um by tag um i take things by ingredient or or by recipe so over here just a couple of different ingredients and let's say i have a lot of dried beans in my pantry i can open that up and i really like that i can straighten put some instructions on how to how to in that way and prepare beans whenever i need that and i already put in like some some use cases uh nachos for example but yeah i can also go into the backlink section and for yeah whatever i use it refried beans or tortillas or nachos um i can see that straight in in there and i think that's a really fun way to to see whatever i want to come up with um or i browse it by recipe and and can see the the couple ones that i that i put in there and that'
