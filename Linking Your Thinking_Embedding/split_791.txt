m waking life by richard linklater it's one of my favorites and the way i've split it up is with a write-up of my own analysis and then a breakdown of each of the scenes with a clip not each scene has a clip because you can't find that on youtube unfortunately but they do have a script and they're followed with a scene interpretation and some final thoughts as well as some related links that lead back within the brain forest or elsewhere other projects that i am working on are more along the lines of brands branding and marketing and the nature of our perception of reality which i am kind of excited to go into all of it has to do with connecting different themes back to what i know about brand experience and branding for anyone who is interested in this i'm really excited to release this at the end of january one of my goals is to talk about this with at least quite a few different people at least 50 who can share this with the right people who will enjoy it as it grows and develops and emerges and i can do that with help because for anyone who wants to get in on the brain forest or get lost in it per se they can go to my website and make a donation and shoot me an email and i'll reply with a link to this pkm thanks again nick for creating a really fantastic workshop experience i can't say enough great things about this workshop it's been great to go through the material with a very enthusiastic teacher in a very warm and inviting community thank you for letting me share this with you i hope to see whoever is watching this inside the lighter obsidian forums and if you have
