tually create plugins and extensions that help accomplish those things without needing the hacky workarounds so i would love to just like tap a button to open only my project files and use metadata in the project files to dictate that because it is a pain in the ass to use these different symbols and to explain them to people whatever they ask about them and so i think that's a i think we'll see this sort of cycle where users do these neat techniques and then developers see them and say hey we can do that a little better and build it into the software with this plugin so that's a dream that would be that would be nice and and this hits on two things and i actually i was talking the reason i was talking with joel's because i hope to do a lighthouse with him more so like in october or november time frame but because he's huge into auto complete and and as far as retreat again i'm speaking for you so i'm gonna cut it short joel but just the the value how one symbol can help with your auto completion and retrieval but then the other side of it is collaborative purposes where if you're working with people in this collaborative environment can we agree upon uh symbols so we can communicate within a small team or whatever that this symbol means this and or but to your point that's where smart developers might solve the problem again without having the need for us to rely on on such things and we'll be very interested to see interesting to see how that gets solved the collaborative questions yeah they're very unresolved in my mind i think like lots of people are excited about colla
