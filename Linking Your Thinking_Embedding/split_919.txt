s hotkey so that's a command click so 
where's another one adversity paradox command   press command and click boom we're there okay 
let's now i'm looking on the side and let's go to   the next one so number two toggle preview so 
this is edit mode this is preview mode how   am i getting there i'm hitting command e what's

keyboard hold down command and you can toggle   back and forth when you're in preview mode as you 
might expect it looks nicer but you can't edit   when you're in edit mode you see the you know kind 
of the behind the scenes formatting of markdown   and you can edit so that's number two 
number three open the quick switcher so   once you do want to start typing bring that 
right hand off of the mouse and hit command   o and that opens up the quick switcher then you 
can start typing whatever word comes to mind   i'm thinking note star but i can't remember it 
so i was like note and then n-o-s for whatever   reason and then ooh note star i hit enter boom we 
get taken to the note so that is another extremely   valuable hotkey let's throw in the next three 
boom number four search this is command shift f   see what happens here it takes us to this new 
pane we were at file explorer but when i hit   command shift f i just can start typing and 
in this case i'm going to type in for never and i can see the two notes populate immediately 
maybe i want to search for a hashtag so then i go   concept and i have these three concepts 
and i can see it was used twic
