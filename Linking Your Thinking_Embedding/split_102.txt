ne but chat GPT is already better it's often quicker and easier because it does a bit of the tedious work for you now let me explain I wanted to know the story of Don Quixote so here's the search engine way off to Google I go search for Don Quixote then I have to decide what I want to read out of that whole list now often Wikipedia is a good choice but that's job number one you have to decide what to read then I have to read it and figure out its meaning that's job number two and what you get on Wikipedia varies a lot sometimes you can just read the first paragraph other times like this you've got to go deeper into the article at this point I could go back to Google and read a different article in which case I've wasted time with the first article and now I'm just rolling the dice that the next article will be better with chat GPT these two jobs they're gone I just ask it to tell me the story of Don Quixote and I got this paragraph and that's all I need with a single question I got what I wanted AI like chat GPT can help inform you [Music] next up I want to know which character came first is it Don Quixote or Shakespeare's character Hamlet now this task is a little different from the first one job number one I need to Google Don Quixote and find out when it was written job number two I need to Google Hamlet and figure out when it was written then I can decide which one came first now instead of this bit of boring legwork I asked chat GPT which came first and it just told me done and then I can copy and paste from here and then I'll throw that into my note on Don Quixote so
