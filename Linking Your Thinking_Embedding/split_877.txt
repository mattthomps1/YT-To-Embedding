p-up window pretty cool when you're just going down these bunny trails but you don't want to lose the main point right so if i just kind of hover away the main page is still here so it allows us to quickly hop off to explore bunny trail and then we come back to the main point and then we're back where we want to be so we don't lose our place we can just quickly travel and then travel back so i'm finding that to be pretty important now here's something that's really cool i'm going to hover over refraction thinking and actually i have the page right here as well so this is refraction thinking and here's what i did i put in a checkbox i can check it right see that testing surely i can't just click on oh my so what's going on so if i hover over refraction thinking i can actually look at that i can actually check the box off from the hover mode there are some workflows where that's going to be pretty cool pretty valuable i'm not huge into the check boxes with my idea management but a lot of people are so that's two down we covered save workspaces and we covered all the new features of hover preview now we're on to that sneaky one that actually packs a powerful punch and what is that it's copy search results so let's check it out so checking this out the first thing we want to do that i want to do i want to change my workspace so i hit my hotkey and i'll go back to the base workspace all right so what we want to do is go to search and let's check out i i know what i want to search for i want to search for flow because whenever i can get a chance to plug mihai's work this is mihai
