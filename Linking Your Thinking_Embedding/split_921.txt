in this pane but if we command click over here 
on a node let's see what happens command click on   this node it opens a new pane and these might be a 
little tight so in case you weren't aware you can   find the edges and drag these however you need 
to so you can see them so now we have two windows   and remember what i can do to see preview 
mode i can toggle that with command e here   is me toggling preview mode again now let's say 
maybe i don't want to look at red pill blue pill   so what i'm going to do is quick switcher what 
was that command o and i type adverse oh there   it is and i hit enter and i'm at the adversity 
paradox so hopefully you can see just how powerful   this application is especially once you know the 
markdown especially when you know a few basic   settings and especially especially when you 
have a few hotkeys at your disposal so if you   like this video and you haven't already please 
subscribe below and especially in this video   please comment below i mean these are just 
eight hot keys i'm sure if you have any   experience with obsidian you may have found 
your own hotkeys that you really really enjoy   and i'd love to see what those are below so 
please comment down there and i hope you've   been enjoying these videos guess what we're on to
