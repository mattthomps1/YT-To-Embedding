of notes let me make this a little bit easier to look at but if i add a second one like commentary then that list goes down so i mean there is a way to very easily to to kind of filter by using more tags and everything the only thing that um so so i think they're an extremely powerful tool and the way to look at them is remember i said earlier a link is just a relationship by another name tag is a relationship by another name it's just a weaker relationship right you're just kind of saying like hey these two notes are they have the same hobby that they're interested in whereas a link is saying they are related like they're blood relative essentially um so i think yeah the tags are really valuable the only the only thing is don't you can get in the trap the the the trouble of over tagging just like hey can wha what could this possibly relate to so it's important to to define how you want to tag like descriptor tags um in my home note i try to show like i show right here that my most important ones and then if we jump into a note like writings you know i show other ones that i can use so when in doubt i use that top down fluid home note to direct me on how should i be tagging my writings like okay yeah yeah this is a journal um what else is it uh oh eventually i published something well journal and output wouldn't really go together but journal maybe it's a letter too maybe it's a letter i wrote to somebody personally so then these two go together but this allows me to understand these home maps what tags have i kind of validated i want to be using you can go crazy with descr
