y but you know and you don't have to append mlc here i just it's a little bit easy for me to find it as i look but then you know you could let me copy and paste this again give that a title and then i might just quickly outline uh i won't call it heading but um topic one moc and then you know i'd have link something like this and they just come right because you probably have these notes you're not starting from scratch i know that so then you can just start putting them in place and then you know let's say link 20 is also you know that's the nice thing about a map of content you can have a link in different places and so i think it'd be about considering how you can you know this would be the top-down approach where you're starting with your topic you're starting with the title and then you drill down to topics i mean think like five paragraph essay perhaps you know just different um templates that you skeletons that you can use outlines which which one is going to work best for your you know research for this project and uh something important is making sure if you're working with others that you you kind of figure out what topics that how they see things too so you can kind of decide what these topics can be and how they can look i hope that's somewhat of a helpful beginning okay i know this is a quick demo and you weren't focused on creating a real chunky note if you were how would you indicate that the wikipedia entry is not your writing yeah i totally would indicate that by the way so thanks for bringing it up scott let's go back to chunking yeah i was working way too
