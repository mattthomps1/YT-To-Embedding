 wanted to do it that way and probably pull in like yaml metadata like i do for the bookworm ratings and then the search target this is so the tag that it's looking for in this case daily questions slash exercise and then the start date and then these are all settings pertaining to the line itself so the rating um basically what's going to appear on the graph if i you know see right here on the y graph you know the rating and then a minimum and maximum value and there's different types of charts that you can use with this as well there's probably a little bit of overlap and functionality between this and charts view but this was available when i was trying to solve that problem with my daily questions and so i just kind of stuck with it okay well this is pretty fun so we didn't even do an introduction which was kind of um intentional just be a more casual chat with this um the idea is just mike and i are chatting with each other and trying to ignore all the people in the audience um yeah so anyways but now we're going to transition into that okay a list of all the plugins that i use uh maybe it's easier for me to just screen share this part real quick because to be honest i don't even know everything that i i use uh i've been playing with a lot of different plugins so i'm just going to go all right auto backups uh i had 500 gigs worth of backups in my dropbox folder so that one's no longer there um better word count i like this because you can select a portion of the text and it gives you the characters and word count you can also do something kind of like the writing goals
