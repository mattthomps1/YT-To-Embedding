day before and then bring in what is important to obsidian as well and just let me look at the time now it's still time i'm i'm talking so fast that there's still some time left and so what i really love about this um clean space because when i as a writer i just start to write very fast sometimes i just wanted to show and when i have ideas and even maybe links and create some new notes i can just have my yeah emojis there this would be my thought emoji oh i can also show you my emoji cheat sheet but what i was just wanted to show is that it's really easy for me to um yeah clean my space so when i have at the end of the day several notes here they show up here and i can just move them at the end of the day here and so i always have this clean space but i also to make sure i don't just put stuff in there i also have this open a random note and go back so i really want to stay in contact with everything i do i don't want to just throw stuff somewhere and never work with it again and i think what i like to do as well is go to the graph you can also see here the those are all my novel projects they are very separate from everything that's just because they are and this the big thing here is all the non-fiction stuff what i really like to do is also go here to the stuff here and see if i can make some connections so i really go also every day back to my notes and see if i can make new links and if i can delete something sometimes you also can delete stuff yeah and i have an emoji cheat sheet just to let me see yeah where i they also can quite see this is still again the um folde
