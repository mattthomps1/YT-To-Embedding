 plugins that i'm keeping track of which don't go for me go to me for plugins because i'm always like two steps by two hubs two steps behind you're very busy teaching people how to use them i get to just mess around with them but for fun that's just kind of how i'm thinking about things so i just shared that in the in the chat and everyone here who's using obsidian can just quickly open that up or use a different tool if they don't want it opened in their vault so we're getting a little tight on time i wouldn't be surprised if we go just a tiny bit over but we'll try to keep it fairly fairly tight so there was a juicy question by uh joel one of the things i struggle with is that if i have a note title that's a commonly used word i use a lot like mlc or china then outgoing links find connections to too many notes any ideas on how to make it clear that a single word is a standalone note something like babylon for instance okay so there was there was a lot there let me open up which one of these was new pain control enter okay sorry i'm still terrible with hotkeys but i have gotten a lot better than when i started out all right so the question was how did like differentiate between like when you're using the same word a lot yes especially when that same word is a standalone title like you have on screen with china and babylon okay so um what i tend to do for this is just own it uh like i don't maybe i'm hang on here let me paste that in the chat yeah like can you can you show me the chat we're getting better i'm just i'm so much better with reading it's in the chat now but joe
