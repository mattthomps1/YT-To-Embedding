take us off to different jumping points they're like little portals that take us to a new area as you get into flight school one things we cover are workspaces so if i were to open up the map view well those are those four notes laid out in sliding pane view for me so i can see arrival here i can see checklist hanger and then if i want i can go over to map so let's go back to the core view with the main view you start with which is arrival now how do we rate this through the lens of the lean forward learning principles so i just created a note i'm going to open it up let me pin this and then open this up into a new pane and how does this work with curated yet non-linear i hope you can already see that a lot of intention and design has been built around making it just like that so in that curated and non-linear way we see that we have an arrival area and there's a curated way to go about things and that's the core experience mainly in the hangar but if you want something that's non-linear you can go wherever you want you can go into the flight school let me pin this real fast you can go into flight school map and then say well let's go into uh preview mode you can say i want to jump into obsidian core maneuvers what does that even mean what are the core maneuvers of obsidian and then you can kind of see where we're going with that right here and then you can look into the simulations maybe you want to start with a simulation and then see where you're at maybe it's a little bit too advanced for your current um skill level so then you have to go back and then start going throu
