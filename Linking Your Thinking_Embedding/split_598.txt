 yeah okay you can so uh there's a workflow that i posted on the forums i don't know if flow is the right word but uh my my system is very based on the length of the title so um if you noticed some of these are very like short and almost all of the short ones are more like what nick would call an moc although i i think mine are a lot more structured than nick thinks is totally appropriate for an moc sorry nick but uh so i i it's kind of why i called them indexes for a long time but i i recently this is what i meant about making my my slip box flatter i recently merged all of my um topic notes just into the mixed in with the xettles because i started noticing that i was having like an moc that referenced another moc that referenced another moc which i think is the point um of all of the network thought and it just got to be like kind of messy where this is a this is a top level thing for this thing that's also kind of a top-level thing for this thing like with domestication and then domestication of animals and then animals uh so i kind of just shoved it all into a box and stopped worrying about it which like i know they told me to do like six months ago but i didn't want to until i was ready for it but now i'm ready for it and the the naming schema of a lot of stuff is that things start out not very atomic and then they become more and more atomic so i'll start with china and then there's these um notes that reference things for it and they become sort of more and more narrowly focused as i go but i can delete the single word do you delete the single word uh note at the end
