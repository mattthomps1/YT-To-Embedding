uld have um some people will have a collection for every paper they write and so it's like you might use the same article for multiple papers does that make sense it does okay good yeah it does yeah i mean for me it's the gmail labels and and how i use those label folders to to add multiple tag like label folders to each one so this is good okay i'm not sure where you're going to go eventually i'm curious where the site key comes in from zotero side but yeah oh okay so let's talk let's talk zotero for real not just my city involved right so zotero has this thing where it's an add-on which is is basically a plug-in so in order to make this like work you need to have three plugins you need better bib text is where you get the site key from and it like sort of automatically does some bibliography thing in the background that that is magic and does stuff and then there's zot file which does a lot of the um the pdf like so oh so the cool thing that zotero does um is there's a web clipper and with the web clipper i just go and say i want this in my list of stuff it's like a little it's a browser extension and then it will plop an entire website or article or i think you can even do it with youtube videos if that's not too meta maybe i'll try and like do it in one of the youtube videos [Laughter] and then it just it like it links up with zotero on your computer and it will just magically import it and rename it and pull all of the metadata for you like i i don't not i didn't i didn't find this stuff myself really i don't i don't care but it's useful to have like left to my own dev
