that problem was taking the idea of animal intelligence and planned intelligence how are they similar how are they different if you take an animal brain what does that look like for a plant uh if you look at fear the emotion of fear in an animal what does it look like in a plant then just comparing and contrast trusting like this those ideas across two different domains is also an amazing way to come up with new ideas so those are my three main techniques and to bring them all together um something i really like to do is build a concept map which maybe some of your audience are already familiar with but if you're not it's a bit like a mind map where you're putting um different ideas on paper and linking them together what's different about a concept map is that you actually define what the links are about so this arrow in this direction means that this idea is impacting this one in this way this arrow in this one means that this one is stronger than this way and you just write it down and it's a really nice way to chain and and cluster compare and contrast your ideas on paper and kind of see patterns emerge in this way love the concept map and when you have to define the relationship that is again being active in the process and that's helping to make better sense of things so it seems as though you are a fan of words that start with c you've got combinational creativity and then the three c's right i'm sure you're quite aware of this uh chaining clustering comparing contrasting um and they're all just amazing uh the chaining i i did not include that sort of question in our
