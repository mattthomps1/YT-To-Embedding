advantage of publish now then hit the catalyst 
option and it's just a one-time payment of 25   and then you can play around with this 
really really cool feature now long term   there this will be an add-on service so obsidian 
publish will have a monthly cost to it and   this is how obsidian i mean the question was like 
how are they actually planning to make money the   app is always free all these core functionalities 
are always free so how are they making money   and obsidian publish is one of those ways so 
instead of using squarespace and paying whatever   that amount is what instead of using wix same 
situation the idea here is that you use publish   and the beauty of this this route is now you 
can use your notes your linked notes in plain   text and use publish and they look beautiful so 
that's really the value proposition here i think   they're going to be quite successful i'm looking 
forward to see how different people use publish   because as i mentioned i only have a couple ideas 
and it'll be very exciting to see where it goes   as for me as i've mentioned i'm a big andy 
matushak fan so i'll be doing something similar   with the light kit it'll be public and it will be 
iterating updating and hopefully providing some   some ideas for everyone who visits it hey so if
