 something that looks like that looks like this right like this this is a raw data dump and what i normally do is i go through and i turn it into something that is much more like this and as i'm going if i'm like why did i highlight that that is a useless piece of information i will absolutely delete it i have deleted things before but even when you've even when i've like deleted stuff i wind up with like it's still here it's still 7 000 oh i see yeah it's still long yeah totally but i mean you can see like i i have notes to myself of i had a question useful for contextualization useful for this useful for that this is interesting because like this is all linked stuff it's all my economics notes and it's how nice this looks though i mean i have to say there's it's a you have a pretty nice theme here it's palliative i made it specifically for this because nobody else cares about the little quotation mark on the block quote which is there specifically for when i paraphrase stuff because if i have a long quote i'll paraphrase it and i still want to differentiate it from my own thought so i have a little code block that um here you look intrigued so i'm going to show you i am i am so i have a block for um here you see how there's not a little quotation mark i paraphrased it wow okay so gotcha that's really nice because the paraphrase is that strange area yeah i didn't want to misquote it somewhere that i didn't want to like claim it as my own and if i use this as a reference for something i want to know like that i didn't just pop off with that or pull it like i don't want to i
