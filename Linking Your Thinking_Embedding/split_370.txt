 a certain uh default intuition that that might be a stronger relationship between those two articles it's not necessarily the case because there are going to be different editors and different people on the board at different times and different authors so it's not something that you can say is a canonical example of relationships but i think it is something where it is interesting when you look at who's linking to what and how and that does tell you something it might not tell you everything you think it does but it tells you something interesting about those relationships and it's something that you've you can't explore i mean there are articles that have you know zero bi-directional links and there are articles that you would think that would be linked together that actually don't share one so it's it's it's it's not a perfect use case like for example the article on david hume human kant are related in a lot of ways kant has this really famous saying that reading hume awoke him from his dogmatic slumbers that hume's critique of metaphysics and epistemology really spurred kant to develop his own critical theory now the human article doesn't link to the kant article directly so that's something that that's an expectation that if you already know that then you're like huh that's surprising so these aren't perfect but there are enough opportunities for overlap and intuition building and coming together then even though they're not perfect i think they're still really helpful yeah absolutely and and good analysis of their about how we can approach it here and then and perso
