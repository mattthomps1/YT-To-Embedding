 library and the interlibrary so for example if you see those books that i have here they are mostly my auntie library which means like things that i have created and i say i really have interest in reading them they are good quality but i haven't read them yet so they are on the things that i will study where the things that i have processed that i have had thoughts about them i took notes they become my library so i have this concept when i work with research and it's important to have an inbox where it's just where you just throw stuff that you saw like ah this paper may be interesting you put a small note and so then i'm trying to this is to unorganize it in my case so i use evernote and pocket to to do the inbox and after processing the inbox something is going to the interlibrary and when i decide okay i read this paper now then i move that into my library using obsidian so i have here one uh folder which is for files and i put all the files in there so i have like people i have invoices that have papers here so after having those things in obsidian i do a backup always with everything is synchronized with my google drive so i always have this on my phone or other computer and then comes the process okay now that i'm i'm reading that whatever do i get the pdf which i can read on my phone i don't know how to pronounce shadow or preview on mac and i have different colors of highlighting meaning different things and then from that comes the first part of extraction which i do in obsidian so one example of is this note for example so i have some bibliographic information
