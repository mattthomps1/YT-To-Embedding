ble and like well there's got to be a better way it was actually when i read steel like an artist by austin cleon that that's where this started because that was tangentially related to my belief that i was not creative uh because i play music and i like to write songs you know i would write a song and then i would realize that i stole the chord progression from this other song and when i heard it on the radio i'd get frustrated be like oh man i just can't create i don't have that gene i can't make up anything completely original and when i read steel like an artist by austin cleon he basically said that when you create something you're really just connecting dots there's the connection to the graph view in ways that haven't been done before so the dots themselves are not original and at that point i was like aha creativity is a formula i just need to connect or collect better dots and then my brain will connect them whatever comes out is the natural output of this equation and i don't to judge it anymore it just is what it is the only way to influence this is to just figure out how to collect some some better dots so that really you said that really well i just want to take a moment to kind of you know remind myself to watch this point because that's so well said you know somewhere in society someone where we're brought up it's the idea of the creative you know genius who like comes up from scratch these ideas and um that's harming more people than i realized i think you know being in the pkm community i was like oh my gosh like it's hard this idea that oh i'm not creative
