added into my moc um with still like marriage i'll i don't like to just have because this isn't just a list right lists are worthless i have a list over here my my list is my files um i want to know why it's in this list but like i don't i'm not always the best at updating it as i go what i want is a thing at the bottom that's like unprocessed and then all of like it's like a to-do list right so i don't have to find it in the back links pane with all of the things that are linking to it to say do this and also linking to it because it's useful yeah relevant like i want to separate those things out and dataview basically lets you search it lets you give yourself a to-do list without having to navigate to it yeah no you just nailed it there that that makes the perfect sense perfect sense because then we haven't done it again okay so the way to use i'm just saying this out loud for myself um the way to use data view for mocs is um as a as a curated backlinks um a temporary curated backlinks list potentially i'm not saying that's the only way but that might be a way to experiment with where it's at the bottom of your mlc note you still have all your custom contacts that you've manually gone through the the fire to create and you figure out all this nice structure they've had interactions conversations and you say okay we'll start with why here get the definitions down then we'll go into some details relevant newsletters relevant newsletters atomic notes questions references okay so that's our mlcs and then below all that we'll have the unsorted stuff that's related to marriage
