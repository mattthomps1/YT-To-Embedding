s name so i'm a little nervous about this actually but uh you know enough people ask me questions about it that i i thought that if there was an example they could they could poke just like you're like okay but not as sort of oriented towards teaching me how teaching people how to note take like that is you are much better at that than i am but if you want to poke sort of an active vault you you can i just feel like a lot of the stuff online is great like your light kit but uh not always a working example so the teacher in me just kind of wanted to share a working example if if people wanted to to go poke what an incredible incredible resource that you're pr providing there i will be poking around i'll be getting lost in the maze poking against all the walls and seeing what doors open um we're going to kill two birds with one stone in in the next question which parts of your vault do you keep private and could you show on your end how publish works like on the obsidian side because they're yeah show which folders that you select i'm sure yeah so the stuff i keep private is um here i can show you the like it's it's in if you look at the structure note this note on the vault like i i tell you what's in all the files right like but i don't feel comfortable sharing other people's notes to me about my stories like that feels rude so i tried very hard to remove anything that was like a raw dump of a conversation i had with someone on discord about something that like i have notes about that but it it like felt rude to put those private conversations on me if not for money um and
