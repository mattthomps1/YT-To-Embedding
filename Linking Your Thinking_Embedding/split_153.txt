s i just get goosebumps because the idea that you can learn by by chewing on concepts by colliding them by i don't know maybe getting them to combine in interesting ways it's just exciting but with that in mind let's go to the topic what is combinational creativity well i just love how you just linked it's very meta but how you just linked the generation effect to combinational creativity because there is actually a link um so i think a good way to understand what combinational creativity is is to look at the kind of traditional definition of creativity a lot of people think that creativity is basically this idea of having a muse that comes and whispers in your ear ideas and gives you inspiration and this is a very old idea because you can go back to the work of ancient authors and poets and artists and so many of them were complaining about the fact that their muse are silent has abandoned them and that they have no ideas their creativity is gone and a lot of them in fact were using chemical substances opium alcohol whatever it took to get them used to come back the good news for everyone listening who wants to be more creative without having to consume any opium is that you this is not how creativity works and all creativity is combinational in nature there's no something that just materializes from thin air any kind of creativity in essence is taking two or more things that already exist and combining them together to create something new and so this is really what combinational creativity is um so what's really nice about it is that it means that it can be controlled it
