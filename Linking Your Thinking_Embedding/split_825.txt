map of content or another metaphor is imagine there are these big house parties where all of these notes have gathered people having conversations and by click you can jump into a different house party that's kind of how i also can view a map of content and that means it's easier to find an evergreen note but because if there's just islands floating around somewhere you can find it but it might be hard to to to make that happen 32 i've seen brian jenks oh yeah he's a great guy discussing the idea of links to empty non-existent notes as a form of tagging yeah no i i love that concept i think i have let's go to the graph view and existing files only let's get rid of that let's make this a little bit more viewable don't pay attention to this calendar thing but um we're looking for purple purple notes so that's not included in the light kit what's a good example ah thought unpacking that's a term that means something to me let's keep going to a better concept point being is i can see these notes that haven't been created and then immediately work on these notes um i have a graph the graph view video on youtube is probably my best uh demonstration of how to use non-created notes and different things to to really spot what you can work on in a hurry and and then yeah then you can just ping out to ideas and not even touch them it appears all your notes you keep all your notes and a central vault is that correct um all my notes in a central fault yes no well not all my notes i have my uh the archive library that i'm slowly integrating into the obsidian library which it requires um
