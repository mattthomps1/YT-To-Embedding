o do well side note before we go into that we can also fold lists in preview what does that mean that means if i fold these lists hold on just a second i didn't auto fold but if i fold these lists as such and then i go back to edit mode and i go back to preview mode we have the folding in preview mode that remembers wherever you left it and that's quite nice so if i untwirl hotkeys and i toggle to edit mode and then i toggle back it remembers that so that's a kind of a nice feature and same thing we can also fold headings just as easily in preview mode and it remembers that okay now if you press the three dots those ellipses we can unfold and we can always fold unfold here as well i kind of prefer this just because i can toggle it that way but wouldn't it be nice i don't know if i didn't have to hover my mouse directly over this to get a quick fold or unfold well let's explore what we can do there and that is a hot key called toggle fold is that the official name so if i hit if i search for fold okay so toggle fold on the current line toggle fold on the current line so toggle fold and now i've mapped it to command 3 and i'm going to explain why later so what can i do with that well if i just click my mouse quickly over here then i can hit command 3 and start to toggle fold that i can toggle fold this that allows us to quickly collapse information expand information as needed now what did i skip fold all headings and lists i can do that and i've mapped it to command option left now on windows that would be control alt left left arrow so if i hit that button everything collap
