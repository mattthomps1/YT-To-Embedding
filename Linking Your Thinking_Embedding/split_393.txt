ch where if sometimes if you don't act on an action from the um home screen it sort of gives up and then you need to reboot the device so i'm not going to do that i'm just going to go in here and tap the projects list so this is going to do something similar it grabs a list of projects that i've got in obsidian i can show you what that looks like and then from there yeah seeing shortcuts has given me trouble from there try it again obsidian click the projects button it gives a dynamic list of projects that i keep okay so it's a kanban this is the file that that shortcut actually draws from and what i did was i said split up this file and give me a list of all of my projects and the cool thing is that if i move these objects around the kanban then the shortcut that i just tapped will actually dynamically change so i manage all of my projects i actually give or i manage my projects and my i use obsidian mostly as a project management tool less as a knowledge management tool which might uh be something we can talk about later but if i manage my projects from here it actually will dynamically change how that shortcut that i just launched shows the list of projects that it'll show it and the topmost one is the one that corresponds with the current project button over here so it's a similar idea for the books if i change the order of books in obsidian and i tap the current book then i will jump right into that first book on the list what you're showing you have uh the advanced workflows that you've set up that lead you you're creating an environment and this is kind of a nice jum
