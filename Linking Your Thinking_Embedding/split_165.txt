se sometimes i'll start writing the outline and realize that oh here's a gap i didn't see with the concept map actually so maybe let's go back to this and explore a little bit more or um sometimes i'll have an idea and i'll find that there's everything i need in my note-taking system already because this is something that i've probably been interested in for a long time whereas sometimes it's something very new and i need to do a lot more research so there's this kind of method to the madness but it's i think from the outside it would probably look a little bit messy and but i think i think this is part again of the playfulness of it i don't try to apply a very rigid system to my creative process i really try to make space for ideas to emerge for um for for creativity to happen and uh and i really follow my cursilly this is really the compass that i'm using to decide what i'm going to write about next it's it's really similar because we're uh we we say a lot of the same phrases and when i hear something that you say i think wow wow um it's really in the air it's really in the air it's in the zeitgeist so to speak and it's just cool hearing hearing things like ideas emerge and and then something else though is that the the process because i always think i'll start on paper to get off you know like get out the noise then i'll go digital but you're actually saying well some you know go digital like see things but then i'll take it to paper concept map it and it's not always linear like you said but then then you can go back and then yeah google docs for the final output do you
