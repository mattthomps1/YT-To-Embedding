our like yama and stuff and i don't because it's a note like i can tell what type of note it is from the title of the note i don't need to like tell myself to type in a tag or anything and how about you yeah i don't i don't do that other i don't do that as well the thing that i do like to do is say if there's an action i want to take on a note and i don't want to forget about it so then i can just give it a very simple like tag so that you can see all these boat notes these are notes that like there's this this i've heard about this guy but this is all i have it's just reminding me to go back when the time's right and look into connecting this lonely boat floating in the ocean all alone to some other notes so there's there's a connection so that's i mean like even mihai is under the boat note because there's so much more i can say and i don't have any that many links but if we go into like develop then these are probably have a few links but i'm telling myself there's more i can do here and uh but they're just fun like that's the thing it's not a to-do list a seed box is kind of a it's an opportunity box really it is yeah when i'm bored at nine o'clock at night and too tired drawing an entire article i go poking through my notes to look for things that i could like you know be inspired by and then i maybe add stuff and then i maybe accidentally write three articles exactly exactly but it's not like what i set out to do because i had to do something it's just ah man i'm tired here's a list of things i meant to do something with i don't know i don't want to work on a project
