 a few launching   off places it's very a very practical way to stay 
on top of your notes and stay in a creative mode   so let's just explore the graph mode a little bit 
further here's another concept now i've put that   in i hit enter or click that button to search so 
these are all the notes that have hashtag concept   in them and i toggle on existing files and so i'll 
toggle off and let's explore which note i might   want to jump into so if i toggle them off and i 
can say okay seasons this concept of seasonality   and i want to make this easier for you to read 
seasons it connects to two notes that have   that haven't been made yet the enso and 
the oroborus if i'm saying that correctly   so those are oh and dragon and phoenix so 
certain concepts here that have a cyclical   seasonality to them and if the time is right i'm 
like okay let's approach this concept i can dive   in i know exactly where to focus my time and 
it's pretty cool to go in that respect okay   okay next up let's explore one more hashtag with 
this concept and this is a a note a hashtag that   i use for notes i want to explicitly develop 
further and it's just hashtag develop so let's   search for that and i can see existing files only 
and then very quickly what i'm going to do here   is toggle that off and now i can see all sorts 
of notes that i might want to develop further the movie groundhog day leads me to bill murray 
leads me to another show that has that groundhog   day concept russian doll right here and it 
can take me to the buddhist concept of samsara   we can go in so many direction
