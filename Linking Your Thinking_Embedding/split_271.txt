was getting to be like oh golly i have all these backlinks and then i have all these times when i talk about pigs and you know there's there's a bunch of like the breadcrumbs made it kind of a middle ground between every time i've ever mentioned it and having to manually update everything for my map of content whereas this lets me do it as i'm down talking about vivisection of the ancient world i can just remind myself hey this is part of the pigs are useful for medical research chain this is useful like this is about animals because we're talking about medical research with animal experiments so it lets me kind of just dump these concepts down and then move on cool and so i see your bookmark that's an external link to a paper or something yep and then uh cool and then if you had a question you could just do an indentation somewhere and throw in a task icon check box and somebody somebody asked earlier if you can query those with dataview you can't yet but it's on the beta branch you can of the data view plugin like like the developer is working on it but uh my note structure is a weird edge case for how he thought people used task icons because he didn't know about the icons he hadn't like you know it's a cutting edge thing um so he had set it up so that any bullet points were part of the metadata of the task and no longer part of the metadata for the note which caused some problems so he's still working on that but you know another month or two and we will have figured out a path forward that hopefully doesn't require me to refactor my entire vault i thought it was alread
