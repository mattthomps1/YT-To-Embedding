 try not to overuse my tags a whole lot uh in the because the file explorer is almost always open for me in obsidian i try to just have i see like common groupings of things i'll create a folder that's basically the gist of it so when i have a whole bunch of uh sermon notes and i'm like oh i think i should put those together i'll first put them in the sermon notes folder and then when i get too many in there i break them down by year and month and things like that so i just kind of how it how it makes sense uh to my brain visually but it's really not that big a deal because i use double brackets to link to the things that are really important i really rely on like the local graph when i'm looking at a note to see the the connections between different things so i don't think there's a wrong way to do the folders uh let's see have you read a book since you instituted the practice of a three cent summary would i write another three cents summary uh good question i don't think i have rewrote a book that i've added a three cent summary i do reread books um specifically books that have been very impactful to me like essentialism by greg mckeown is one that i will go back and and reread from time to time i've reread gtd several times although the more i read that now the more i i nitpick you know little holes in the system and i've kind of evolved it to meet my own needs and so i probably would not go back and reread that at this point i think if i were to reread a book that i had a three cent summary for i would just update the summary if needed but i i wouldn't necessarily feel
