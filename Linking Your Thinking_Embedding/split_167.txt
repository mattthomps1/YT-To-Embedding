se microsoft words which is horrendous and it's funny how i feel like it also impacts the way i'm thinking and writing i tend to be more calm in google docs my sentences are shorter uh is is just like less verbose whereas the the environment of words makes me feel like i have to talk like a researcher i have to write long sentences it has to be complicated so it's more effort for me and very often i end up downloading my articles from words uploading them to google docs to do the final editing just to shift that mindset and go into nest labs writing kind of mode and then obviously for for twitter just because you have those restrictions in terms of length of the content the fact that if you want to write longer things you have to break it down into discrete units of ideas like if you do a thread each tweet has to encompass one idea that also makes you probably think in a more bite-sized structured way um so this is yeah this is why i would probably see a difference between people i know some people write their threads outside of twitter and just copy paste them afterwards whereas others write directly on twitter and i don't know what the effect is but i wouldn't be surprised if there's a difference in tone and the way those tweets are presented in the end depending on where the tweets were actually crafted yeah there definitely would be i'm absolutely sure of it if it's in twitter it's going to be punchier shorter more uh like declarative and then if it's if it was done in a journal if you're writing in cursive i don't think you're going to be making the same statements and
