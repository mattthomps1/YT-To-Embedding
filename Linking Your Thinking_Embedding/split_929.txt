to see that these arrows they're   pretty tiny on the screen but they exist and we 
can see sometimes they point in both directions   like this one and sometimes they point in a single 
direction like this note to this tag okay cool   now we can get into let's let's take away the 
linking and i hit enter to go back to everything   okay cool now let's go into the layout we 
just turned on arrows node size it starts   around one and now we can make the nodes 
really big i don't think you want to do that   let's go back to one i find it's really good 
just to keep it there link thickness again i   don't think the thickness really helps maybe you 
want to go with less thickness it starts around   one so maybe we take it to let's say 0.7 ish and 
just make those lines a little bit less thick   pretty awesome okay now we we are going 
into some really neat gravitational i don't know meters that we can control so the 
first is center force so if we turn on center   force what's happening is the gravitational force 
is becoming stronger so now all of these nodes   are much closer to each other right probably 
a little bit too much let's back that down   and let's just for right now we'll take 
it we'll keep it at well let's do 0.7 okay   repel force so this is you know how much 
they're pushing away from each other so if   i turn that up they start to push away then we 
have link force the strength of the actual links   and then we have link distance so how close they 
are versus here let's minimize minimize minimize   move out now let's look at link distance so 
this best way to d
