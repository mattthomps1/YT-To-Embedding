hink maybe the most underrated shortcut and obsidian is commando because you just type that in and then type any little bit of any note title and it shows up and your one you know carriage return away from being in the note and um i know that's silly and basic and everybody probably knows that that uses obsidian but i mean i use that many many times a day it's not silly it's kind of perfect because yeah left hand right hand both on the keyboard commando yeah start type i mean it's really magical yeah and that's one of the hidden powers of these apps these that are out the tools for thought is just autocomplete how powerful autocomplete is yeah yeah exactly not not only with the finding but even just creating the links and things like that yeah all right so now over on the left on the left here right so i have this thing category this folder i call ideas parentheses for now and i just like to remind myself that nothing in here is in concrete or carved in stone and i have absolute ability to go in and change my mind about things and that's just kind of a little reminder and it makes me smile when i see that you know that you know whenever i get to the point where i feel like i know it all then i know i'm in trouble and so i i like this is a little humble reminder to myself these are just ideas for now and these are all just various notes on things that i've been putting together and i've started actually organizing those into subfolders but this is like i say a work in progress and i still have have work to do on it but just to give you an idea one that i i feel comfortable s
