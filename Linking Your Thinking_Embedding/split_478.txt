haring i have one here um uh is this interstitial journaling which is a little rabbit hole i went down recently um the idea of journaling throughout the day and um you know what are the benefits i've been just kind of writing down what i've been doing and just as thoughts occurred to me with it i've been keeping track and then i found a couple articles uh at nest labs and a couple videos about it that i watched and then those go back to like media resource notes um let's see what this gets me yeah this is a youtube video by dan silvestri that i found at some point back in june and just kind of i made some notes while i was watching it but you know these i this is an example of just one of the little notes that i have in the ideas and i imagine if anyone i'm curious your thoughts on the interstitial journaling because you do so much of it as a lawyer when you're logging notes for each client so how is how are you taken to just this interstitial personal journaling side of things um you know one of the things that's funny is i did journal you know there's a honeymoon phase with obsidian where you want to turn it into the everything app and i think that's a mistake ultimately um there are very good apps that do things better than obsidian but obsidian is very good at what it does and um when i first started using it you know because i have historically did my journal in a paper notebook with a pin and there's just something about the practice of sitting down especially for someone who spends as much time looking at ones and zeros as i do to you know have a minute to get a pin
