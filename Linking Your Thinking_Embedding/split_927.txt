i'll be straight with you for the past several 
months i could care less about the graph you   in in linked networking uh note-taking apps i mean 
to me it was just kind of a gravy on top the icing   on the cake right like how are we really using the 
graph view but in version 0.9.0 the game is subtly   changed once again the developers have added a lot 
of interesting features and they do two things for   me that i've already noticed they increase the 
level of joy that i have with working in obsidian   working with my notes making new notes and number 
two it increases the level of of frictionless   creativity so in the following demo i want to 
show you what i found so far and this is just   hot off the press so what i found so far that has 
improved my workflow two major things coming up   okay so let's hop into this new graph so here's 
the main overview first thing i'm going to do i'll   collapse this side just to give us some more space 
let me open up graph view it loads i'm collapsing   the left hand side as well and so here's my graph 
i'm just going to center it maybe zoom in a little   bit new features check it out upper left filters 
and layout there's a lot going on here so let's   just break it down let's play with each option 
and then we're going to get into the two workflows   that i've already that i can already see these two 
workflows are going to help my creative process   i'm very excited about that so hey let's look 
we have a search window where we can search for   any term any term so let's just blinking 
i know this will come up a lot i hit enter
