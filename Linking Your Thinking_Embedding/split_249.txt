e another screen share screen one second and i chose i guess i'll start a little early on the seven seas just to talk a little bit about that all right so sharing my obsidian window yeah this one shall do okay so we're talking about accretion a little bit later and there are some c's if you ever encounter some sort of concept that you find interesting uh trying to make a mnemonic so i made the seven c's of note making and these are a few of the c's each of them have a prompt and you can go through these prompts to kind of figure out how to make sense of something in this case i was curious about the word accretion because it seems similar to accumulation but it's also different so i wanted to kind of figure out those differences so this is something i did elsewhere but let me make this bigger there are a few prompts and the first one is connect so the first thing i want to do after creating the note is to connect it and so within this note i'm trying to make connections and one of the most powerful prompts that i find in existence is this reminds me of and then i might also say it's related to and really important is a forcing function to say the most relevant link for me is blank and that becomes the top link or the actual linking your thinking link and that usually will go at the top of this note so this is the before eventually we'll see the after oh we have eleanor back excellent so let's do it let's um pause this one for now and we'll we'll close this loop in a second so let me remove that how are you doing i don't know am i back you're better you're better i i'm sorry
