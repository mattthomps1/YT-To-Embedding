have you ever tried to copy text out of microsoft word or evernote or even email and it comes out as a bunch of unusable gobbly goop have you ever tried a shiny new writing app for maybe a couple weeks or a month thinking you'll use it forever but then a couple months later you know that you're not and then your writing is kind of stuck there and you have trouble getting it out writing in markdown solves this problem it might look intimidating with hash and asterisk symbols but i promise you there are only six keys that you need to know to be writing like a pro with the confidence that your best ideas are not trapped in somebody else's program let's dive in okay so let's begin first thing i'm going to do is hit that button the new note button and this creates a new note we can title at the top i'm going to paste in the six most important keys to typing in markdown i'll paste it again in here now i know what you're thinking it's just bold or italic right well no maybe in traditional text editing in word we would think bold and we would think italic but in personal knowledge management we need to think how to connect ideas we need to think about how to link your thinking with that in mind we've already discovered the most important part of markdown which is the link and that's where we hit bracket bracket and then all of a sudden we have this list of our notes you know programs like obsidian are really smart so if i type no these are the notes that remain and if i hit s there's an s in note star then i just have to hit enter boom now we have that link that's pretty wild right
