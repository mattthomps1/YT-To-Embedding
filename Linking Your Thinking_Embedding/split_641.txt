ian fault like mine is it is like my root dropbox folder it's my everything like i i have i have my medical paperwork is in here like i i think the whole thing you have a full you have a whole folder for people you've dated i see so that's that's interesting no no no no no i'm kidding my uh so uh the reason that would have been plausible is that uh my husband and i joke i i tell time and boyfriends so i don't remember the year that things happened like oh yeah back when i was dating jeffrey oh yeah back when i was taking sean and now that my husband like have a baby he's like we're like we're gonna be married for a long time like eventually that like the dating system of one like you know of of which boyfriend you were dating in that you know one to three year period is not going to be a useful metric of when a thing happened and i was like oh but it's you know when our son was a baby and when he was a toddler and when he was in preschool like this is gonna work fine for me because i um i'm terrible at remembering numbers i like i it took me three or four years to remember my husband's birthday uh so it's like i don't know if something happened in like it's not oh yeah back in 2013 it's oh yeah when i was in law school let me do some that would have been 2013 okay it wouldn't it would have been like 2009 but uh but yes like i don't i just i'm not going to numbers gotcha there was a scenario in which i really did have a folder for people certainly not a not a root level folder but uh so um so i don't do anything with the pdfs and i'm saying i could people do um you you can a
