shop has six live team this okay yeah i see the workshop has six live team sessions 90 minutes each i live in the southern hemisphere are you able to say what time those live zooms classes will be we are going to solidify that time my best guess right now is that it's going to be um eight or no excuse me 9 a.m pacific time so that's the time right when we started this zoom session except two hours earlier that's the most likely zoom time there is a possibility we split up into two sessions depending on location we did this in the private cohort one so if there is really this big split in the hemispheres and we need to we can approach that so i'm very very open to do that and we've done it previously i think it's best if the group can be together but let's see what happens oyster sauce do you recommend writing x number of notes every day no i think you should write them as the opportunity comes up now if you are a serious professional knowledge worker well then yeah then you you have to put in the work it just depends like what you're doing in life um a good metric to consider um is this how many evergreen notes did i write today and maybe you just you want you want to get above three it doesn't seem like a lot but three times 365 you're doing a lot of work so that's something to consider this is from mike braddock thank you mike um can you talk about the conventions you use and follow and how you developed them that is a little uh vague but i'll i'll try to think about it from that zettlecostin um background the conventions i use uh i would say is this the conventions i use
