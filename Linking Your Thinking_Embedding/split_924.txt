here   i don't want to go into all those features but 
we're just exploring the themes let's check out   one more dark theme and then we'll go into light 
mode check out a few themes there and just kind of   show you what's possible so this theme um this 
is a pretty cool theme what's neat is members   of this community and you know typically any 
community they're creating themes that they enjoy   and so here's another one by a member of the 
community and you can see the different headers   are different colors so that's an important thing 
if you know for this theme it's an important thing   let's see what other colors there are 
so okay pretty cool yeah i can dig that let's stay in edit mode and let's go to 
appearance and we're going to switch to light mode   and let's check the community themes for light 
mode so we've dealt with a lot of color and this   theme as it happens is clean theme so let's 
check out clean theme see what this looks   like so i mean if you're just used to dark mode 
it's like wow you know the irises are blown out   but after you get used to it well maybe something 
can be done with the graph view but after you get   used to it it is uh going back to this attention 
note you can see here's bold here's the tablet   and we can see the different headers the 
links that we can go to different nodes   so this is a pretty minimal theme the 
idea with the minimal theme is it's   great because it's just you and the text so you 
can actually just work on your ideas and write   that's what we want to do we want to have 
a little bit of fun yes but then w
