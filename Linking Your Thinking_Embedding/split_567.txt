ecause good example would be today's session um i wrote this big long thing on frankenstein and i want well let's not use that one let's use let's say i want to just make these sense making takeaways their own note so what note refactor does is i just made it its own note and it links back to the note i was working on it's like whoa this is so powerful and you know five years from now ten years from now it'll be second nature it'll be like hitting a on the keyboard but for right now it's mind-blowing this is how it should work when we work with text like their ideas and we can just move them around so that's pretty cool however note refactor is not needed as much because there is a chord plugin called note composer that you should also get to know and a good way to use that would be on frankenstein here where i'm going to select this text specifically and using the core plugin i'm going to hit note composer and i actually have a note on frankenstein i don't even remember what's in it but i'm going to merge we're not going this isn't a tutorial on uh obsidian but if i did merge it let's look at the frankenstein note oh okay see that's no note composer i'm a little new with but what it did is it actually pulled in the entire sense uh session in here so not exactly what i wanted but the point is we want to be able to shift around text so there's sliding panes and then there's no refactor that are community plugins i definitely recommend you don't have to use either of those the other one that i find really helpful is tag wrangler which allows me to really quickly go to my tags
