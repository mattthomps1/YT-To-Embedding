going to eventually make one but right now everything is feels to me like the only way to really approach is the way you're doing it is um of you know kind of weekly you're going in and updating it frequently with your your videos or like mike and the sweet setup are doing where they're updating videos um but right now i i just feel like it's too early for me to go into that app but i i will do one eventually i definitely feel that things change rapidly the one i'm still trying to figure out myself is you know how will i be using yaml in what capacity um yeah let's see these these questions um thank you to deirdre and helen along with daniel for kind of organizing organizing these a little bit can you explain more about setting roles or what is your process of setting roles rather than setting goals yeah i mean the uh i learned originally that you know the top of the pyramid or you know or maybe the the bottom depending on how you think about it is goals you know like you have a goal and then you design your habits and your your planning around that but i always found that as kind of empty and you know the problem is what happens after you achieve the goal does that mean that all that doesn't matter anymore and mike schmitz and i talked about this on focus where he's talking about when he ran a marathon and then he got to the end and he's like okay now what you know i achieved the goal you know but i think the thing is um when i was in college i studied political philosophy you know it's kind of weird i was an aerospace engineering major that switched to political science b
