o is to just look at one link   and then see if i turn it on the link distance 
expands if i turn it down the distance   decreases it shortens so for the most 
part i find that this layout information   you'll just want to adjust it once and then 
you'll kind of find the settings that work for   you so let's spend less time with the layout and 
now dive into a couple use cases i've discovered   i think you can discover some too that will 
work for you but i want to point out these   two because they are awesome to keep you creative 
they are awesome to keep you in note making mode   so we're not just mindlessly wandering around 
this uh magilla universe of notes but we're   actually diving in we're using the graph to our 
benefit and we're making actionable steps forward so now let's start with hashtag habit i 
know i have a lot of notes with this and   we can see i'll get rid of the tag 
actually so i can see all the notes   get rid of orphans existing notes only get rid 
of attachments so these are all the notes i have   that have a hashtag habit in them and i have 
a couple moc notes these are maps of content   i have a lot to share about 
these in different videos   but what i want to point out is existing files 
only so this is where we start to toggle something   and it's important to toggle it just like i'm 
doing so right now these are only existing files   i toggle it off and you notice now we have these 
grayed out nodes these are notes that haven't been   created but i've linked to them so let's let's 
imagine i'm focused on or you're focused on   this project yo
