eal   world that lead to real outcomes real results and 
allows us to survive in a world where you have to   provide value and get compensated for it 
so how do we balance the tension between   ideas and projects that's what's happening here 
what's another tension folders versus links   we've had folders forever we're relatively 
new with links how do we manage that tension   and then the third tension that we're trying to 
manage is structure which folders provide a lot   of versus the chaos which sometimes we can feel 
in a environment completely filled with links   the intention around the access folder structure 
is that we get the best of all these worlds we can   manage knowledge just as effectively as action 
we can use folders and the strengths that they   provide as well as links and the strengths that 
they provide we can have both structure when we   want it and the chaos because the chaos is where 
some of that beautiful bottom-up energy comes from   where we start generating really unique insights 
and we can really tap into our creative selves   how does that accomplish it well let's kind 
of twirl these down the first place is called   encounters because generally speaking we encounter 
things and then we express ourselves in between   we do something called thinking but mainly 
it's encountering and expressing and that's a   feedback loop and we just go back and forth 
between those two things so the first folder   after we encounter something this is where we can 
put new ideas by the way and then we have a place   to access some of those maps of content s
