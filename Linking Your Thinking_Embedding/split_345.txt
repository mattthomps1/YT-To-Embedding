in rodon and beethoven in fact i think they're both in here is verdan um no i guess he's not yet so i'll add him later and then oh mash there was somebody else um well i think picasso is another interesting version of this slightly different but these are at least a few people that i want to start tethering to this concept in my mind because i don't know when you when you look at people's great works sometimes they knock it out of the park when they're really really young but usually it's something that has been flavored and marinated for a while so anyways that was fun now let's go back to the graph view and see where that takes me next so i mean this is it folks this is some note making this is me making sense of things making connections i don't remove the develop tag from either the two notes that i've worked on so far because frankly i'd like to develop them further and they're really not getting in the way they're actually kind of all mixing together in this melting pot that we see in the graph view here so just little bits and pieces i kind of hit a wall mainly because i'm narrating as i go but it's a nice start so i'm i'm kind of happy with that okay where to go next let me think oh i like this one because aliens are fragile what does that even mean i'm about i'm about to get into that oh gosh but i remembered one okay great works are flavored by early works how could i forget because i really have been just he's one of these guys um herman hessa oh looks like i already have a link on him so maybe we open up herman's note i don't have anything there if you did have
