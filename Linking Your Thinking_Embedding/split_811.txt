[Music] this is a public service announcement from linking your thinking what is a note a note is any container of thought pretty broad huh let's think about it note to self yes sir noted sir a note could be a sticky note or scribbles on a napkin that maybe you've kept around for a few years pretty cool huh a note could be a single idea or an entire library of thoughts it can hold the data about a person or log the phases of the moon the contents of a note are only limited by our imaginations so if a note is indeed any container of thought then that means the internet has more notes than any one person can read in their entire life a thousand times over so let's tighten our definition of a note so it's more practical for you and me when we talk about a note we're really talking about containers of thought that means something to us that means it doesn't matter what's on the entire internet and that is such a relief because we don't have to be overwhelmed by all of that stuff what matters is what notes we've taken personally the notes we've personally made take note a note is a container of thought that has meaning for the person who made it so a note can be a bit subjective one person's trash is another person's treasure and at their best our notes are treasures at their worst our notes are overwhelming adhd riddled collections of thoughts we've never actually read that act as this static noise that distracts us and discourages us from spending more time with the meaningful notes this is the collector's fallacy and it's practice by the information hoarders so scared to lose
