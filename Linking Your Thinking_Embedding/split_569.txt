 community plugins do you check the github repos of the plugins yeah so that's that's a really important question and what is handling community plug-in security so essentially the way obsidian works is anybody can create a plug-in and then you might download it but that plug-in's not safe because they have something hidden in the code so there are a few factors that prevent against that for one on the two developers look at every plug-in it goes through a review session before it's approved they are pretty pretty good they're pretty good at what they do that's the first line of protection the second is the community itself if there are zero downloads somehow and you happen to beat everybody to it don't download it wait for the people who who are the very early adopters to try it out and so it becomes community proof as another form so yeah you can check out the github but the obsidian discord forum is really where you can ask these questions about hey what what are people's experience with this plug-in does everyone feel like it's safe and then you'll hear opinionated responses and if it's out there it's going to be safe that's how i feel but you know you have to have your own privacy policy and safety policy with different plugins do you use prompts in your note making process well the prompts are training wheels and they're also kickstarters after you are used to the process you no longer have to read the manual to just get going so sometimes you need a kick in the butt though and so let's go back to the prompts or you need to overcome the big wall in front of you so hey
