then that third that the fourth thing the fourth thing that makes these notes apps ites is that they are highly extensible you can customize them with the community's development of with all the plugins and extensions that the community has developed and so a very quick example of um one of those ideas is i built and published yesterday or the day before what i call the qualitative analysis integrated thinking environment and the idea is that if you're doing research that involves qualitative analysis that is you're reading text you're deeply reading text you're trying to code that text for ideas and for content for topics and themes that it contains conventionally you would use something like maxqda or atlas.ti or nvivo which are expensive huge pieces of software and i suspect that people often don't use many other features in them and so if your use case is relatively simple and you're not used to those apps you might actually be able to get away with just using an obsidian vault so that's what i did i built out a obsidian vault that uses a set of specifically defined features in the vault specific plugins specific ideas specific workflows and then you can use that to accomplish this dedicated goal of doing qualitative analysis so i think most of what we are actually talking about today is a specific type of ite focused on knowledge management right focus on on managing a bunch of notes but you can actually think of ites as a variety of other tasks focus on a variety of other tasks and so another example of that is uh uh or sorry calistorian mark robertson's uh talked a l
