tes to other references um yeah i think like here on god's drawing joy from his labor that's where i reference this specific verse and then like give it the different alias um or so so i i know where where this is said actually okay i see how you've done that and how you've linked that to genesis on the side there however when you're reading genesis is there a way of actually going from genesis to those notes yeah so i think i hope i understand you right but yeah that would be the backlinks here on the side yeah so talking about like the note of the creation account that i just showed and here it shows me the back link to god destroying joy from slaver god so it was good yeah thanks very much i think i've got what you're doing there yep thank you yeah cool great uh yeah thanks for jumping in yeah in in the forum i like in this self i i posted like there's a thread on on how people organize the bible and there are a lot of great great thoughts in there as well in the script to get all of this in here yeah but but it's a constant way of figuring things out yeah great um yeah for in interest um nick introduced this this way like structuring it in different ways and i like um here that's an embedded bible verse so i like for kind of every every area that i'm interested in actually pulling in is scripture and because i want the text to be quite central to my life so i i i want to see what um what the bible says about every aspect and make it very practical yeah so in here are also a couple of different mocs and notes i'm not sure what if that is so specifically interesting right
