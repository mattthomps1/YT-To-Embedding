e it's updating I use this a lot I think anyone who's writing or even if you don't consider yourself a writer when you are writing and you want to stay within certain lengths it's very important to know how long you go random note see this dice over here we can start opening random notes dare me to do it now I will I'll do it all right workspaces projects my top three plugins each go into something else let's see what else recent files delete current file plug-in file recovery I'll remember this daily note that we made let me go ahead and delete that because we don't need that anymore my Snippets this is another one let's get something more exciting all right we've got some queries that's at least a little bit more exciting file recovery ah here we go opening a note so now you can see a little bit more of the action in some of these notes should I roll the dice I did this is one of my more favorite ones recently is how you can quickly manipulate tabs within obsidian and then we talk about each of these as a command each command oftentimes has a video we talk about if it's a universal hotkey or if it's not how you can use these all in sequence and it's very important that you can manipulate and I mean that in a non-person to person sense but as in using your digits your hands to manipulate things like someone would manipulate clay right so that's what we mean here and the better you can do that like an ace pilot the faster that you can think the closer you can get to the speed of thought okay cool so with that in mind let's go back to top 44 and let's finish this out publish
