better and that's the idea here is that once you know how the knowledge process is encoded that's an acronym it becomes clear how you can improve yours so let's break this down into something practical so before this video is over you're going to have something practical that you can leave with some questions that you can ask yourself to see which of these areas you might be able to unstick yourself just a little bit so now let's look at that acronym this is the knowledge process and the becoming process and it forms the knowledge loop it is encoded e is for encounter note is for noting things that you come across connect is c o organize develop is d e is express so that forms the word encode and then all of that is driven by our final d very a lot of different factors i will cover that in a different video on the becoming process so this is encoded and that is the knowledge loop the same simple loop i want to show this one more time this is the knowledge of loop two right information touches us and then based on that information we react and then we have new information that's all it is that's all this is the knowledge loop is encoded and what's cool about that is then we can break it down to really simple language what happens in the encounter phase of knowledge we can just say something what we say all the time hi that's it hi hello hello new idea hey let's have a conversation hello person let's have a conversation whatever it is and then when you stumble across something with the n note what does that mean i'll make note of that oh i'll take a note there what do we say
