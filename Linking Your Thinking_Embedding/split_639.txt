ot of research is not open access and available so so this did find three open access pdfs which i think is cool so i'm going to move these into my open access collection i'm going to move the ones that are not open access into my restricted folder and then i'm just going to delete this collection because it's no longer useful so now we have a bunch of stuff this is in a language i do not understand so i'm going to delete it because it is not useful to me and then let me i should have done this a second so let's see what some of these were covenant international i think this one was israel and the assyrians zotero all right here we go this probably came from that utopian moment solomon the queen of sheba and the negotiation and the utopia and some other stuff okay so this is about negotiation probably in the bible and the cool thing that file did is this is now in my vault okay zot file we which i don't know if we've mentioned so we did better to bibtex we've done md notes citations and zot file right so it like from literally just from that bibliography file that i got off of research rabbit i i imported the whole thing into um into here and like you can go through and delete whichever ones you don't want and like you could have i i could have just unselected the right i was just proving a point so you pick which ones you want and then it'll make a big file of the ones that you checked so don't feel like you have to like i i could have done a better job of checking which ones were in english first but you know it's hard to think of everything when you're on camera hi folks
