for many people block reference is a killer 
feature a superpower it's what allows bruce banner   to become the incredible hulk but is that always 
a good thing sometimes it is sometimes it's not   but before i get into my hot take on 
block references let's explore this   exciting new feature in obsidian just as a 
reminder i'm nick milo and this is linking   your thinking where we talk about the why and 
how of making meaningful notes let's hop in   i have made a new note with today's date block 
ref test i've made a couple sentences this is   me testing out block reference let's talk about 
the mental squeeze point so that's another note   i know there's a nice paragraph block that i can 
use here so let's start with an embedded reference   to the main block of the note so starting from 
scratch even though it's below i'm just going to   explode it with an exclamation point bracket 
bracket so that's the notation then i'll do mental   okay so it auto completed i'm going to arrow 
down to it so now with it kind of highlighted   in the arrow down i can hit the shift six block 
references like you know it's a little bit more   to take in so just keep that in mind this is an 
advanced use you certainly don't need to use it so   i can hit shift six which will insert the carrot 
now it's looking at all the blocks in that note   i'm going to choose this main paragraph note 
that i want to use and let's see what happens   cool so the carrot changes to a hashtag and it 
gives it this hex identifier so i really don't   need this for reference anymore now if i go into 
my preview m
