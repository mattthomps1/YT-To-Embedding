 of having this kind of true north node my approach was very chaotic in the sense that i would open my vault and 100 bottom up i would get drawn into whatever note i happen to see or open or create and so this really functions as a sanctuary where i can you know come here and this is what i do so the first thing i see is i have these sort of quick start like a little small hack and this is really just because i have a varying capacity for noise so sometimes i am able to get into the vault you know kind of click down into things but often i really just want to see the bit like the absolute essentials so i toggle the below based on kind of how i feel and what i want so this why am i here section which is modeled after the what it was called what i want this honors the fact that the volteverse is such an all-encompassing space for me i enter it for many different purposes as many different version as versions of myself so it really tries to be respectful in helping like different knees navigate kind of what's here and and what what you know where i'm at and where i want to go so the first one what i do when i get here okay so i need direction and then i go to the daily moc and this is really just what's important on any given day and so this is kind of like a mvp for living so just the bare essentials that i need to get by when i need to anchor myself this is where the snapshot comes in so it helps me get current so the work moc is you know where the serious stuff goes down i can maybe quickly go in there so i kind of have things here grouped by like company by a role by like
