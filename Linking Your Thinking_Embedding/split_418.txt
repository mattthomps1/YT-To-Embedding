 the previous paradigms you know just realizing that you should wake up earlier in the morning might be an innovation if it depends on uh something that you're something important to you but all innovations are driven by what i called a prompt so maybe you had a need maybe you had maybe just had a spontaneous idea that's cool too or maybe you had a question or a challenge that you're trying to resolve and so there's a chain of events that happen between that prompt and then actually applying it actually using whatever you do in between having a prompt and applying it to change the world change your world change your local world or change the the bigger world and so i actually would argue that janitorial work to bring it back the janitorial work can be fiddly can be useless if you're not driving it from a prompt if you're not driving it from a good challenge from a good question or a good good uh sort of issue that you're trying to resolve so i think we should be managing knowledge and this is the controversial part we should be managing knowledge for the purposes of innovation we should be in managing knowledge to try and respond to issues and problems and ideas that we have in our lives in order to do something different in the future that or be more resolved in whatever we're doing the same but it should be making a difference it should be for some given purpose so you're liquid it's fiddly when you're doing it to procrastinate i love where this conversation has gone because i think it's we're hitting on so many neat topics and knowledge innovation knowledge development k
