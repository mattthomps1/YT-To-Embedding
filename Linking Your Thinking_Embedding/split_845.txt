n do you want to track information chronologically and so i can think of let me make this even bigger for people looking on their screens when would i want to do that for me it would be meetings we can consider this a meeting you know like personal tracking you know anything that's tracking logging is a perfect opportunity to to timestamp and why not use a that'll cost an id or you know maybe you you say that you don't really need that level of depth that's you know an aesthetic purpose and to a large degree it's an aesthetic purpose i understand that these little costume ids will never change um and that's that was sort of the beauty of them early on um like in the archive now with uh with rome and with obsidian links like file names auto update so if i were to change the home note um and just add some nonsense to the end of it then i can see that it was updated immediately as a backlink in all those files so i'll just take that back that kind of makes the the this specific timestamp as a unique id less valuable to me because i i believe that this auto updating file name is the new standard i expect it i feel comfortable in its future-proofness but if you don't then certainly use this for for all of your notes if we do feel comfortable then it goes to when do we want to track something chronologically and anything like that is a perfect place to add you know some sort of time stamp something like that okay let's see and 42 okay this is try to fly through a little bit faster let's see do you consider it appropriate to describe in the home page and mlc not only the relations
