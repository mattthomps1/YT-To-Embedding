hey cadet and welcome to obsidian flight school let me show you what this is all about here's the walkthrough after you download flight school it'll show up it'll be a folder wherever you download it to you open it up through obsidian which i've already done and then will look like this flight school arrival welcome to flight school and this is sort of your engaged hands-on orientation and so there are four ways to orient yourself this arrival note and three others checklist hanger and map so depending on how you want to go about it you get to choose your own adventure now i prefer that you go through the flight school hanger and we can see what that looks like and let's go into preview mode and yeah you are here because you want to improve how you can pilot your linking your thinking ship which i would call the light ship that allows you to fly around your pcam planet your personal knowledge management world of information so what does that look like well if you go through the hangar there's a basic training wing and there are four legs to the program there's obsidian formatting there's an obsidian setting section themes and my favorite area which is the core maneuvers just by mastering the core maneuvers you're going to be so much faster with using link-based applications specifically obsidian then after you get through the basic training wing let's fold and collapse that you get into the piloting wing and this is where you really take things to that next level we work on the interface working with text navigation and some other keyboard combos supporting those two wings
