rt of most important things that i thought were most important at least okay and purple this is like this is sort of the what i learned tyrion purple doesn't need as many snails as people think do you know what you probably don't want to talk about i'm intrigued though so uh tyre was one of the um one of the really important cities in the eastern mediterranean and their big uh trade good historically speaking was purple uh purple dye so you probably heard of imperial purple and you're probably familiar with the fact that like wearing purple was a sign of royalty and part of the reason for that is that in the ancient world um this like very particular shade of of purple slash red it's like tyrion red serum purple it's like a really rich imperial purple color um was was made from like the shells of these tiny snails that that lived in the eastern mediterranean near the city of tyre and they had figured out how to like turn them in to die in this incredibly intensive process but uh it's like they've recently learned in roughly 2007 so like not that recently but from the perspective of all of the years of history that have that we've had this notion about syrian purple it doesn't need as many snails as you think because you can sort of like cut the dye you can like you can it doesn't have to be pure in order to get the color gotcha gotcha very cool and for a long time they thought uh oh there's a there's a person in this painting that that is wearing a purple dress so it it absolutely must be that they traded with tire and they were very wealthy and extravagant and that's just
