ll the mystery or the muse whatever you want to to put behind that i federate the small questions into higher level uh questions which are also maps of content and the big idea of this is to understand the order of the answers i have like this big unknown and where do i need to tackle things uh where does the first where do the first answer come from and also but it's also very fluid and it enables me to tackle the book not through plot or not through characters or not through the world but through anything depending on the need or the feel sometimes a plot takes precedence the plot takes precedence for writing a scene sometimes it's more atmospheric and the breathing scene and it's the characters sometimes it's tackle it's it's related to my whole project with this world and then i will have to to tackle things through the world i have not enough became followers at the moment i have basically the daily notes i have workshops which uh where the the project of the book and future books live and i have also the light light kit the the light workshop and also i have my two main worlds which are like uh also big workshops but they're important enough that they need their own their own areas and but everything can be linked as i'm working on the book five of the series there's a lot of links going to the areas with the world itself and and and lots of back and forth and i'll be in the two years i'll be working on a third big science fiction world so this is where it's going to live as well uh i'm using daily notes as inspired by nick and some of you for journaling and seeing co
