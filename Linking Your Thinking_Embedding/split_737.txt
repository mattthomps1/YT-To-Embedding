come a left-handed keyboard ninja and what do i mean by that it means that i keep my left hand on the keyboard and i keep my right hand on the mouse as much as i can like if i'm navigating around i don't need to type things i want my right hand on the mouse the only way that works if you want to take advantage of some of this amazing functionality is if you make proper hotkeys so you have to really think about this and that's where i've had some deep experience assistant editing and editing tv shows where i would literally lose sleep at night because i was thinking about how best to program the keyboard with hotkeys that allowed me to work really quickly and if you have any knowledge of the entertainment industry then you would know that the majority of tv shows are not made on final cut pro they i mean there are reasons for that i won't go into it in this video but what we use is a software called avid media composer and you better be able to program your keyboard you better be able to set up really good keyboard shortcuts and so i'd spend hours lying in bed at night trying to figure out the best way to make myself as fast as possible as efficient as possible and a lot of that same mentality has now come into play here so when i set up my keyboard shortcuts i wanted to think about the moves that i make a lot within this app and how i can make that happen more quickly and i also don't want to make things too complicated so i just kind of want the basics and now if you like to outline if you like to brainstorm quickly then these do become the hotkeys that you do want to map
