ember from previous videos this is command P this is a really important hotkey you can see at the bottom of my screen when I hit command P that's what I'm hitting if you're on a Windows it's going to be control P I'll do my best to say command and control but just know if I'm saying command that's for mac and the equivalent is control on windows so now I'm just going to start I don't know what I'm looking for I'm just going to start typing canvas oh there it is create a new canvas awesome so let's create a new canvas and now we see the symbol here and we can call this test canvas live that's a good enough name and now we'll look through all these different buttons So eventually this test canvas is going to start to look closer to this final product so really fast I just want to show you all the stuff that we'll be going through so it's very exciting let's go a little bit deeper so we got canvas set up we created a new canvas now I'm going to go back to settings one more time because you might forget to hit command P you might forget to hit or like to start typing canvas so let's give it a hotkey of your choice so for that we're going to go to settings hotkeys over here now start typing canvas and if you've upgraded if you have access to Canvas now you can give it a hotkey I hold down three modifiers and then I Hit N so you'll see that show up if I do that now and boom we have a new canvas but I don't really want this one so I'll just delete that one later here we are so now what's next let's talk about moving around the canvas and for that I'll go to this final example here
