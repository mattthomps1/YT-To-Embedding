out and and you know the slowness of writing actually i think helps you think more but i for several months i tried to do it in obsidian and that's when i was really exploring interstitial journaling where i could just hit a time stamp and just logged the whole day as i went through it at the end of the day i felt like it was more trouble that was worth because you know i don't need to know at 10 o'clock i worked on the smith project you know it doesn't doesn't matter that much and uh but what i do in turn what i did take away from it is my paper journal now i don't wait till the end of the data journal if if i'm feeling something that i want to think about or write about i'll i will put in a handwritten timestamp you know 10 you know colon zero zero and then i'll write some stuff underneath it and then so i will timestamp by hand as i write in my journal and uh that so that's what i took away from so i'm using it a little bit but not as much as as i thought i would when i started you know researching it interesting yeah very cool so where does that take us ideas for now yeah inbox is just um that is uh right now i don't think there's a whole lot in it i've just got a couple things here but the um sometimes i just don't have time to process something like i'll take some notes you know after talking to a client or watch a youtube video and learn something from i'm not sure where it fits i'll put it in inbox and then every weekend i clear out all my inboxes and this is one of them so that's just you know a processing box uh max sparky is like the mother lode for max sparky yo
