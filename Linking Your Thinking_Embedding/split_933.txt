can you see the power of toggling   existing files only so once your library 
expands this becomes really powerful   now the next one is toggling orphans so i had 
mentioned this earlier boat notes so boat notes   are blocks of atomic thought if i create a new 
note and i haven't done anything with it i'll i'll   put it as a hashtag boat and this tells me this is 
a new idea but i haven't connected it to anything   so it's it's basically let me turn on 
toggle orphans now oh cool so these are   my boat notes they're just floating around 
in the sea of our digital note libraries   ready to be crafted to be fleshed out to be 
fully formed and connected with other things   so if i'm in that mode where i want to 
review these these isolated boat notes   graph use fantastic boat and we can toggle 
orphan on and off okay let's zoom it back out   back to the whole graph let's turn off tags 
existing files only let's not show the orphans   and so this is the graph as we'd normally 
see it i hope you found this useful   this is hot off the press so i'm sure there 
are other uses that you're going to find   please share those in the comments below so we can 
all grow together but yeah if you like this please   subscribe there's a lot more to come and if you're 
curious about what library i'm using here this is   the light kit and this library can be yours i'm 
going to be doing a webinar soon it's going to be   pretty pretty cool i think pretty helpful too it's 
been downloaded i'm not sure over 3000 times so   it's provided a lot of help to a lot of people 
and we'll be going ove
