 with a plain text enviro i mean these are just plain text notes which are which are really cool but it's not the unreal engine uh powering the latest video game so but it is however a self-contained world and once you're there you don't have to leave is it measurable there are timed tests and you can share your times it kind of works i think it gives you something to strive for if we want to look at one other test let's see let's go let's go into the interface obstacle course so i'm going to open this in a new pane here's the new pane and you can see there's a start there are five parts to it and then there's a stop and it says go back to the interface and record your time so if you went to the interface note you could record your time and see how you compare and you can see am i an ace pilot if i was below eight and a half minutes i'm an ace pilot if i'm between 8 30 and 9 30 you're solid if if it's 9 30 to 10 30 decent 10 30 11 30 okay if you're over 11 and a half minutes the recommendation is to try again and you can put your times here so this is a way that we can have something that's a little measurable so now let's go back to the rating system and last multiple avenues of engagement and this is actually the weakest aspect of flight school now it definitely gets the doing part down all these repetitions strong doing so you're definitely doing reading doing watching and especially the doing but where it's a little weak is in the lightweight forum component which there exists a forum component where people can ask questions or if they get stuck with something technical
