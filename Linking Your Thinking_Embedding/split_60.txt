nd of a graphs I draw really quick this morning just to Showcase how my thought process and creation process evolved and just to show a little bit like in my note-taking system what does that mean fully system what does that mean you actually do more in moving a lot of pieces um at the same time forward um in parallel so this I took a screenshot of a note I had in uh January 18th I think is it last Wednesday or something anyway it's a weekday and so this is the stuff I've been working on throughout the day and I'm still working during the work hours ago five and so you can see other people's work only reduce to 20 percent and the rest it's all my stuff green part is my writing the orange part in yellow part is either my learning or my life piece and so you can see you even see my notes about hey certain box I only pack half of that I didn't even finish but I just label hey this is a book box and so I mixed that with the like stickies on the box and I can just flip my phone and search all those information seriously like if I'm going to do those two big goals at the same time still working uh during the daytime it's going to be super stressful but then the results is I don't want to show the results right after uh line nine um I applied the learning and I gave a speaker event um and all the content was produced actually during the same time when I was learning the line nine and I did this and it was tremendous um feedback coming back and I got because of that I actually got a lot of invitation for this year so now I want to show you you know after 64 days what does that look
