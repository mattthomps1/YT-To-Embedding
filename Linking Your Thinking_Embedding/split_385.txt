re but that in this also i see another comment from john a little bit later on uh two days ago we had on ryan j a murphy and he was talking about integrated thinking environment so you must be familiar with ides integrated development environments since you can program and then so he's saying there are these integrated thinking environments such as obsidian logsec rome those type of tools that allow us at least from a personal knowledge management position to create these environments that help our thinking and they can do so many things they can do whatever we need them to do it's very exciting time and it does seem as though what you're showing is possible with these large data sets other ways to kind of create these integrated thinking environments what i like about it and this i'm just trying to like kind of tie this into john's question at the top there joe that you can see but um it's we have this information there's no there was a time when it was hard to get your hands on a book it was hard to get you know access to things we're not there anymore if if we have access to the internet we're not there we have too much and so it's really about knowing where the signal is that's part one but then part two is kind of and there's a responsibility from people who are sharing this information in a way to kind of evoke the audience to lean forward and somehow engage and wrestle with the material doesn't mean they will doesn't mean they will but that's i think one of the fun challenges that we find ourselves in is how to present information so it can become personal knowledge
