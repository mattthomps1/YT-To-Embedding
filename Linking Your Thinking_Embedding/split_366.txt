ut it thank you yeah and i completely agree and and that's one of the things that when i was building it i was really trying to figure out how to make it make a fun and pretty interface but also one that was powerful because you know when you have your own aha moments in the shower or you're walking down the street and a car goes by and the screech of the tire then makes you think of a song that you heard and then that song that you heard was like oh you know what i have a problem at work that now i just figured out how to do it because i i was spurred through i didn't figure that out on my own it wasn't my my my free will sitting down there and figuring out that answer it was this intuitive creation at that moment and for this site itself i really wanted to build in those intuitive moments so you can explore it in an infinite number of ways you know how you want how you want to go around that russell graphics you want to look at wickenstein or you want to look at more or you want to look at something in epistemology and logic your own individual path through the graph is going to be providing context for you to have new intuitions absolutely that's a good way to look at it too then those new intuitions i like that a lot because it's the opposite of being told what to do whether that's by a top-down curriculum or in the world of like task management if you have too strong of a task list that's telling you what to do and then well hey great you don't have to worry about it you know that anxiety goes down that's nice but you also lose something you lose that intuitive ability
