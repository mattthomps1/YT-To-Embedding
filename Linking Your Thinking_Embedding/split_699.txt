 you're putting together you're not just saying i read this and then that that's uh that's lazy in that bad sense because then it's less um solidified in the mind and then i like that you do have a a monthly review obviously so then you can go back and like you said with the space of a month or whatever that that space is and you can look at it with a fresher eyes and kind of see what really you know stood out so this is okay so what parts of our process are we currently of your process do we still need to cover or have we yeah i mean i feel like we've covered everything that i that i do for like i mean like i'm not gonna sit here and make you watch me write an article right like you you've you heard me opine on the topic of an article under normal circumstances i would have opined in such a way into my phone which would have outputted you know voice to text into obsidian mobile and then it would have become a thing that i edited so i think we've hit all of the stages and you kind of just do like you opine like you just did on this call right like during that uh new uh moc no when you're just talking out loud and quizzing me that was essentially what you're doing you're asking a lot of questions you're asking a lot of whys and um you're you're you're digging into it you're you're having a conversation yeah sometimes with my phone it's more fun with you yeah the phone doesn't talk back as much the phone does not talk back nor does my son not not yet sounds like that's going to happen pretty soon though yeah so yeah i mean i guess any questions like was this helpful well this
