u have it so we can see that we have italics in this section how did that happen markdown reads these asterisks to single asterisks like that to give you um italics now let's take that to the next level the number four most important key to working a markdown you got it it's bold so how do we do this so bold is typically like typically i will use this when i want to bring attention to big nouns and what do we do to get bold in this case double asterisks on both sides and that gives us big nouns excellent now we're almost there now we're going to get into the formatting and cover lists so we've been making a list now what's that look like if i hit dash hyphen and and space then i've created a list and what i'm going to do now is delete so then i can enter and software like obsidian is smart enough to know that a list has began so now when i do this i'm starting to make my list and it's naturally forming so now we have formed a really cool list and that's how it's done and the sixth and final thing that we want to do to get a handle on markdown is to understand how to use headers so let's go through the notes and explore this a little bit it's actually hashtag but then you hit a spacebar this gives us that title and there are six levels of this so let's explore in some of these other notes adversity paradox i usually like to have that here so i'm going to hit hashtag and then adversity paradox doesn't that look pretty nice already and let's imagine um we wanted to hit related here and make this something new so we hit three hashtags and look at that it's smaller it's a header
