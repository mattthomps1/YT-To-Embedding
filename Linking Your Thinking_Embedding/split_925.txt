e want to   get back to writing thinking and linking 
so let's check out maybe just one more scrolling through why not this 
one buy another obsidian mod   and this is the light mode version of it so 
we see let's check out the different titles okay all one color which is an off black and 
then we get into our text if there is a link   it's a lighter color and let's jump back to this 
attention note here's bold here's italic so i   think you get the idea like this can be fun you 
can lose hours in this you can design your own   but it shows you the versatility 
and the power that you can have   as the graphical interface in which you interact 
as you take your notes as you make your notes   um hopefully you got something out of this 
video it's a little bit different than the   other ones because i think those other ones a 
little bit more practical this one's kind of   you know fun you can mess around with it spend 
almost too much time but it does hearken to   one of the really important reasons we 
do all this is that we want to have fun   we want the experience that we have as we manage 
our personal knowledge we want it to be a joyous   experience and i have to say when i go back 
to my cybertron theme which we'll do now this brings me more joy than it should let me 
update that this for whatever reason brings   me a lot more joy than it should i enjoy 
working i i'm more creative in this mode   but i know it's not for everyone it's you 
know it's definitely an acquired taste   the point being is a theme can allow you to 
be more productive but usually you waste a lot
