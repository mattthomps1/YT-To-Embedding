 do that let's do the monsoon world what is the monsoon world if you had to guess based on only things i've taught you in the last 20 minutes based on what you've taught me uh the monsoon world is indian ocean and it has to do with the seasonality of the currents and how that affected trade between africa to you know india into china that would be my guess it's a good guess based on the monsoon winds allowing trade between china the swahili coast and i'm not making a link for this because i know that page doesn't exist and if i wind up doing something weird like this while swahili coasts or swahili coast people or just swahili i don't want to mess up my links i want to go into the backlink pane i keep pointing at my screen like you can see me i want to go in the backlink pane and click them and have them automatically do it based on the aliases that's why i i avoid um links to uncreated pages like it's my job i know other people have a different method but that is my method that i haven't seen a lot of people talk about so i'm going to mention it because they don't it's not like wikipedia or media wiki where you can do a redirect you can't redirect an obsidian have to make it right the first time talk with my hands so it was between the spili coast and india now i i know i have a note about the harappan civilization because i usually don't care about india per se so i am going to say harappan parapan i actually don't know i'm a bad person i should learn that so there you go in this valley civilization and like if i were wikipedia this article would actually be india and it
