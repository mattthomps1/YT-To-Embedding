 oh this was um tremendously helpful i um i was hoping to save a few for the end but then i couldn't help myself but interject questions while we went so i'm trying to think uh as i did my best to just ask as we went along because it was um so inspiring that way another thing that stood out for me is you know the power of yaml with data view as as something as a simple solution i guess one thing that i'm looking forward to is i saw how you're using it for blogs and article ideas i'm hoping to also see how it could be used for uh mocs or other types of notes uh yeah that's that's all my to-do list sort of i haven't i really do think that what's gonna happen is like you would use it as like a tag the problem is i don't i don't know how well uh dataview works for if it's multiple so you should be able to just tag it with whatever your moc is it's like if you have a economics moc you should be able to do like moc economics or like literally just tags economics and then if it's also marriage right like if it's if it's if it's a thing about why people pay dowries for for you know marriage then it would go into both and then i think dataview will let you just probably get a list of everything that's tagged with that so if you did that you wanted basically you wanted to add it to moc that and then you would tag it like that and then dataview would just spit out a list of everything you've given that tag yeah it's interesting and then you would as you as you so like it's like the backlinks pane but more more fine-grained and then what i would personally do is as i actually manually
