inking truly is this exercise which is all about the seven c's of note making and that's a process that i want more people to be aware of but in due time then to continue the note making there are the 11 c's of map making so this is really what next level linked based digital notes allows us to do we there are unintended consequences and these are kind of hard to talk about until you feel comfortable with linking knowledge and you can do it fast enough but when you get when you become comfortable enough and you become fast enough what happens is we really break the sound barrier and we get closer to being able to work at the speed of thought and when that happens when you can get through mach 1 and you get close to the speed of thought this activity of map making is not only organizing you're developing you're really thinking at another level at that higher level but you're it i can't i can't give it justice right now but uh it's pretty exciting and then there are other exercises i won't talk about the home note or a couple of the ms of outputs some of this stuff is for later but there is a process here so the goal when you leave this video is that you ask yourself these questions where are you stuck in the knowledge loop then diagnose yourself and spend a little bit more time if it isn't developed then just zoom in on these questions and make it happen here zoom in on these questions spend some time to answer those questions as best as you can then your loop will be a little bit smoother the better that you can go through this loop the better insights that you'll have the
