s out of drafts and apple notes i've never been as much as i like devin think for file and document management i've never been a particular fan of it for notes management in fact the devon think field guide i've got going on right now i'm doing interviews with some people who are power notes users because i wanted to make sure we covered it better than i do um the um the other thing is great especially like i said the ai the file the links but i didn't it's just not nimble enough for me for notes and um obsidian is much better at that so so the way i move notes out of apple notes and and drafts is i created a keyboard maestro script that copies the text and like if i had to do any formatting stuff i did that i have a similar script to get stuff out of obsidian that does a search and replace and replaces double brackets and some of the stuff that's obsidian specific markdown and so i just made a simple script and then i imported stuff as i needed but i do think one of the tricks with the obsidian if you're getting into it is not to dump a thousand notes into it let it grow organically yeah amen to that the organic the emergent growth when you want to structure some things okay quickly test something out but uh don't overdo it i'll let it come to you let's see what else here's another one maybe this will be our last one how do you avoid over foldering topics and ideas i.e a folder for each document at what point are you overdoing it splitter versus grouper and i'm going to just put that in the chat so it's yeah no i that i get it um uh i'm pretty uh careful about that honestl
