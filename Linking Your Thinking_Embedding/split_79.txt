of the calendar it's actually by the same developer as we'll get to later in this video now let's open up note refactor so here we go note refactor this is one of my top three and a half plugins because refactoring knowledge is the way what's so cool about this when you're making any sort of note and half the time we don't know what we're going to say or what idea becomes too long and needs to be split off so how do you do that well how about you just highlight everything and then split it off I just gave myself a link to this new note see how fast that was when you incorporate this workflow you start truly getting closer to the speed of thought and it's just phenomenal now if I don't want to do this that's okay I'll delete this note and then over here obsidian maintains the history per tab that means in this tab it remembers where it was so I'll just hit undo and it's back so we cover extensively how to refactor notes the fastest way the best ways the variety of ways because there are so many so I just want to really Point your attention to how powerful note refactoring is now you might be asking what is refactor even mean think of refactoring as restructuring so if you format to note like if I made this bold that's formatting but when you are and I could reformat this note and I can get get rid of this I could hit undo but when you are refactoring you are not formatting text on the screen your your structuring ideas your sense making through the process of moving text around I I think this is a really profound point and that's why I want to bring it up okay next one data
