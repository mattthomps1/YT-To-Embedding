the map of content let's start with flow map and   you know you read this thing you're kind 
of you're kind of ingesting it digesting it   um there are a couple links you can click 
on that's the choose your adventure so   let's just choose flow creation theory 
and then that throws us into this note   we can read up on this note i mean i'm really 
amazed at how gorgeous this looks online   um then it gets to something that's the four 
factors of flow and the whole idea around this   flow creation uh practical guide was that you kind 
of troubleshoot your issues it's like hey why am i   bouncing out of flow is it because i don't have 
direction in my life i don't have strong goals   is it because i'm lacking the ability to focus is 
it a lack of enthusiasm is it a lack of energy so   in this case it's let's say let's go with 
direction it's a lack of direction goals   and so it's kind of a way to troubleshoot problems 
and then you can be prescriptive to your own needs   the whole point being is this is another 
use of obsidian publish where you can   share something with your friends 
and family and say hey check this out   or you just had a great conversation out in public 
somewhere or online it doesn't matter you can say   hey check out this link because so this is pretty 
cool each note has its unique url i mean right   so now you can share these on twitter through 
text message whatever it is whenever you say to   yourself in conversation you say to somebody else
