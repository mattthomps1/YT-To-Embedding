 amount of structure for 
you because in this digital age of linked notes   folders can still serve structuring purposes but 
we still have the freedom to whenever we want make   a link so we get the best of both worlds extras

unique hybrid that takes into account links into   a folder system it's a it's a beautiful thing i'm 
very excited to to have more people understand   that we can have the best of both worlds it's 
a folder-based pcam framework that also uses   link based maps of content so we can

all sorts of hidden gems you don't need folders   you can get by without but i find that i do

to throw the baby out with the bathwater   with that in mind i want to talk about very next 
lesson the next lesson is about managing projects   in a link based system using the spaces 
folder and more specifically
