ected and and what they are uh so wow thank you for bringing that up that's that's quite something merch is a genius yeah here's from edith uh now that this resource exists how easy hard would it be to create similar tools for other sets of interlea interlinked documents such as a person's pkm or even all of wikipedia so that's actually one of the things that um i'm actively exploring in the back of my head because i i i haven't had time for actually uh to do this but the architecture for visualizing sep is it's pretty specific to the document structure of the encyclopedia itself but i'm really interested in taking this metaphor and really finding ways to to generalize this relationship and taking this and using visualizing sep really as a prototype interface for developing interfaces to explore any large-scale networked set of data uh i think there's there's a real potential here to really change the way we explore large data sets so it it's not a simple process edith but it's absolutely something that can be done uh if you want to send me an email we can talk about it i i met someone else from having published my site and he and i are kind of trying to work on some ideas about how we can take this metaphor and apply it to different data sets to that point it's interesting to see how you did it so the thing that i keep on thinking that really draws my attention is that you chose out of indiana's ontology system you found 27 domains it wasn't 270. you know take off that zero it was 27 and that seemed to be with how many notes is 1708 1708 articles articles okay 1708 article
