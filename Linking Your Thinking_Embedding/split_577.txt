e title the romans wound up banning skywatching they've been skywatching so these are all the little atomic notes but i didn't break my source note and then as i go i can come i can have a map of content where i'm like all right i learned you know i have this this let's say i have this overarching thing about politicians changing rules based on misuse really if i have that i don't have that yet i'm gonna have to go back to this video and take notes on the things i'm about to say but let's say hypothetically that i want to have a note about or an article or a newsletter or something an analysis piece about politicians changing the rules based on misuse of something and then i'll go and instead of linking to this heading i'll link to these zeddles because if i change the title they're not fragile anymore and they won't break because obsidian auto updates if you change which title if i change the title of the file oh yeah because if i change the title of the heading it'll break that's right so it solves all of those like how to make your source notes atomic without losing your source note problems that i was having for like i mean i i debated back and forth with dave ken about this like we was like i understand why you're doing atomic notes but i really i really don't want to like i don't want to lose all and then christian made it so easy just just so easy so now you have the value the value of atomic notes but you get to keep the koenig method right yeah with using the headers too okay so my next question would be if i hope i'm not interrupting your flow is on one of those z
