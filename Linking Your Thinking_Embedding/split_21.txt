ion to the tab problem is the arc browser I strongly recommend checking it out it rethinks how we interact with the internet and with information and it's a really nice compliment and it's a part of your personal Knowledge Management System because it creates a new information realm where most everything you've encountered can be found in a way that feels rather orderly it's different it takes some getting used to but I think it's clearly better once you do get used to it it's now my daily personal browser it's hugely impressive and yes it's still in beta somehow even if you'd never try Arc browser I think one day in the future you'll be using some of these features in whatever browser you're using because I suspect the big boys will be stealing them they're just too good thank you so much for your time everyone I look forward to seeing you again and until then stay connected thank you [Music] [Music] foreign
