this is a very nuanced one the simple answer is as i read new information that i'll create a note not based on the article but based on the idea from the article and then i can in that idea in this new note that is my idea you know evergreen note title i link to the web article so in that way i'm not clipping the article into my library itself instead i created something and then i just linked to it outside um that's the bad answer uh i see paul says not a great idea long term to have your pcam in a proprietary cloud system like in rome well yeah i actually i mean those are kind of the points that i'm really fearful of i mean you someone else has your information how do you feel about that you might be okay with it but i have a lot of private thoughts private information i don't want other people to see it even if rome is safe is it safe from you know like somebody wanting to target it and hack it i don't know i don't feel comfortable with that that's why i marked down that's why private files that you can store locally that's another huge benefit so thanks for bringing that one up paul why do you put metadata at the bottom joel asks keep them coming joel oh eric i see you have one here forever oh sorry let me change this one second um okay the reason i put metadata at the bottom of a couple reasons so if it is a note and it's not a map i like to put the um the content uh the back matter at the bottom and the reason is just because at the no singular note level the most important content is the title and what's being mentioned here less important is what it links to and wha
