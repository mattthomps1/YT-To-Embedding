 time   so i have this site but let's look it out if i 
wanted to change the site options you click this   button the site name let's call it light kit 
let's make the home page file the start here   file let's go with the light mode for now let's 
show navigation why not let's show the graph   that all looks pretty good so let's just go back 
the next thing you can do is hit the switch cite   button and then if you hit the edit site id this 
is part of the url so it's not the site name but   it's part of the url is the site id apparently so 
let's just go light dash kit it looks like we can   only use letters numbers and dashes so i like 
that let's cancel and we're pretty good there   click publish it loads i did have a change to 
timestamps i don't care hey this is exactly a   good example i want the change to populate 
so that's all good and boom hit publish   all that your files will load in this case i 
only had one file that had an update to it so   only that thing is going to update and what 
i did is i deleted it out of the light kit   and in the meantime let's go check 
this link out so click on that and boom here it is this is the light 
kit online using obsidian publish   so pretty cool we can zoom in on the graph we have 
a table of content that's showing your headers   and then we can just kind of dive into 
different notes so let's imagine we started on   the home note and this has a bunch of links to my 
main home maps let's just kind of dive into to uh   concepts so if we dig into concepts then we 
can dig into something else so then we could   and by the w
