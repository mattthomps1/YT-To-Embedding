[Music] whoa okay welcome to another episode of awaken tv with glenn in today's episode we are going to focus on the topic is social justice a gospel issue now when it comes to any topic it's very important for us to define our terms if not we are going to be talking past one another because most of the time if we actually take the time to listen to the other person we will find that we have more similarities than differences now if you are a christian and you rely on cnn msnbc abc and fox to be your pastor or to tell you what the gospel is rather than the bible then that's going to be a very big problem and we have bigger issues on our hands social justice may mean many things to different people i'll leave that for another video it is not as important as the point i'm trying to make today whether something is or isn't a gospel issue so what is the gospel the gospel translated from the greek word un galleon literally means good you so what is the good news the good news is the message of salvation in first corinthians 15 scripture says that god sent his son who was born through the line of david as the man jesus who died on the cross was buried and rose from the dead so to summarize that the son of god became man who suffered and died on the cross for our sins so that we will not be kept out from god's family he rose from the dead so that he could overcome death and be with his father our father the one true god forever and the reason why that is good news is because our salvation is not dependent on our performance jesus christ died for our sins while we were still sinners not when we had perfect theology not when we were out protesting in the streets not when we were deconstructing systems of oppression because what you did not earn through moral perfection you cannot lose through moral imperfection now that we've understand what the gospel is is social justice a gospel issue well a question you need to ask yourself is this is social justice a part of the gospel or does it stem and flow from the gospel if we think social justice is a part of the gospel then that is a gospel plus message because what we are saying is this this is the good news and these are some things that you need to do this is good news plus fill in the blank which ends up making it a works based religion therefore minimizing the gospel because as i said earlier on the good news is good news because salvation is not dependent on your performance based on how scripture defines the gospel i think that it is clear that social justice stems from the gospel it flows from the gospel but it is not a part of the gospel now i am not saying preach the gospel and do not do any justice or do not do any good works what i'm saying is this not only are christians obligated to preach the gospel according to micah we are also required to act justly love mercy and walk humbly before god essentially bringing eden to the rest of the world adam felt jesus succeeded and now as followers of jesus we are called to make disciples of all nations so that's all for today make sure to like share comment and subscribe and hit the notification bell for all the good stuff coming up on awaken tv
