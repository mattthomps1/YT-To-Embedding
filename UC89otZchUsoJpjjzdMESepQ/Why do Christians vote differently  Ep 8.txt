[Music] whoa okay welcome back to another episode of awaken tv before we begin make sure to smash that like button for the youtube algorithm and subscribe to the channel since we are still in election week the focus of today's episode is why do christians vote differently and how do we think through this isn't it interesting that christians in america read the same bible worship the same god but yet when it comes to voting they vote very differently it almost makes you wonder if they are reading the same bible or if they are worshiping the same god the trend that we tend to see is that white evangelicals will vote for the republican party while black protestants will vote for the democratic party even though this historically wasn't always the case so why do christians vote differently the reason why christians vote differently is because they prioritize social issues differently so while most christians would agree that abortion is wrong i actually hope you agree that abortion is wrong rather than believe it's okay to give people a choice to murder a baby so while they agree that abortion is wrong some of them will still vote for politicians who still support abortion because while they view abortion as wrong there are other social issues such as the disenfranchisement of the black community that they prioritize over abortion and because they prioritize things differently the voting results and the way they vote are different so the question is is there a way to think through on how to prioritize various issues i'm now going to go to the realm of applied ethics and provide you with a framework to think through some of these issues for starters christians believe that morals are objective or absolute and that objective standard comes from god objective meaning that there's a fixed tenant of morality that transcends everything regardless of what society your individuals may say under this branch of moral absolutes there are three varieties but for the sake of time i'm going to cover two of them the first one is called the unqualified absolutist i'm going to call this group a people in this group believe that something is always right or wrong regardless of the situation the second group is called the hierarchical absolutist i'm going to call this group b people in this group believe that there is an objective moral law but there is a hierarchy and some moral laws are more important than others so how does this pan out practically especially when there are moral conflicts for example in the case of rehab who'd like to save a life or people who are hiding jews in their apartments and they lied to the nazis if you are in group a you will say no i will not lie because lying is always wrong and inexcusable it is wrong it is a sin and we are forbidden to do things that are wrong on the other hand people in group b will say that jesus thought that there were weightier matters of the law in matthew 23 so you know saving a life is more important than not lying so yes i will lie to save a life they will view weightier matters of the law saving a life as being more important than lower matters of the law that is lying so how do these principles apply to voting you first need to ask yourself how do you apply your ethics do you apply your ethics like group a the unqualified absolutist or do you apply your ethics like group b the hierarchical absolutist once you are clear on how you apply or view your ethics then we can figure out if you are consistently living out your beliefs if you view an ethical lens or group a then you will say that i will never vote for a candidate that is pro-abortion and pro-homosexual marriage because it is sin and they view this as an endorsement of evil and remember this christians have no business permitting things that god forbids however if you are in group b you could decide to vote for a candidate as pro-abortion pro-homosexual marriage a more sinful candidate because you believe that there is a greater moral principle involved in making that decision you would think that you are reducing evil and increasing good in society by voting for this candidate if this is you the hierarchical absolute is a group b then you need to make the case on why you prioritize certain things over the other for the record i'm a hierarchical absolutist in group b if i want to read scripture in my opinion the right to life versus the right to the quality of life is the weightier matter of the law and it's a priority over all other things so i'm willing to break certain rules to save a person's life that is the exception now i'm willing to change my mind and i recognize there are good christians out there who may disagree with my position but that is completely fine for the record two christians can disagree on important policy issues without one of them necessarily being unfaithful it is also a mistake to think that christians should always come to the same political conclusions but most importantly our political decisions should be informed by the timeless truth that god has revealed to us in scripture when it comes to political ideology to be conservative or progressive at all times on every issue is not only to be intellectually lazy and easily manipulated but it's also unfaithful side note to everyone including my friends and the people that i love if you vote for donald trump i love you if you vote for joe biden i love you if you don't vote at all i love you politics is not going to get in the way of my relationship with you and how i love you with my feelings for you so that's all for today's episode remember to like share subscribe and comment for all the good stuff on awaken tv and remember go vote
