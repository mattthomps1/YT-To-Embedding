[Music] what's up everyone welcome to your first episode of awaken tv with your boy glenn if you've been following the news in america with the recent deaths of ahmed aburi briona taylor and george floyd this has led to a series of protests in the streets now i've been to one of these protests and one of the signs that people were carrying was no justice no peace and the reason why they were doing that is because the killers of these victims have not yet been brought to justice because justice is treating people fairly and giving them what they deserve now as i was thinking about this slogan no justice no peace it reminded me of god's character in psalm 89 14 where it says righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne oh god and because righteousness and justice are the foundations of god's throne we see god consistently executing justice in scripture whenever people have sinned against him because in order for you to execute justice it involves some type of judgment for instance those who reject christianity will often point to the old testament to say that god committed genocide when he commanded the israelites to kill the canaanites however if we took a deeper look at the canaanite culture we would have been enraged as well because they were practicing child sacrifice temple prostitution hashtag metoo and bestiality if we had saw that we would have immediately gone to the streets and cry out no justice no peace now these incidents were not a one-off thing because the canaanites did this for 400 years if they had instagram or social media back then one post would be needed to confront this evil but they did this for 400 years and they did not turn from their ways so god gave them what they deserved now to be fair the israelites were often on the receiving end most of the times because whenever they sinned against god god would use the surrounding nations to judge them as well so it wasn't as if like they were the ones judging people they were on the receiving end most of the times now another person that bought the judgment of god was jesus god bore the wages of our sins in christ for missing his perfect moral standard so we do not actually get what we deserve that's called hashtag mercy it's actually a mirror of god telling abraham when he was about to sacrifice isaac that god himself will provide the sacrifice and that sacrifice is jesus christ when he bore the punishments voluntarily out of love so that he can now restore the peace that we once lost from god so hashtag no justice hashtag no mercy hashtag no peace so now as christians who are image bearers of god we are called to bring eden to the rest of the world so that is why we speak up for the poor for the oppressed and those who cannot speak up for themselves so that's all for today's episode i hope you enjoyed it there'll be more to come so make sure to like share comment and subscribe to this channel and hit that notification bell to get all my latest updates now go arrest the cops who killed brionna taylor
