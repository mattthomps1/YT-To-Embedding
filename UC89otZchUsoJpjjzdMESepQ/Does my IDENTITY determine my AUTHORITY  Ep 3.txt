[Music] whoa okay welcome to another episode of awaken tv with glenn in today's episode we are going to focus if our identities determine our authority a trend that i'm noticing in society today is that we are being conditioned to determine the truth of an idea based on a person's chromosomes and melanin rather than their credibility and merit coming from singapore i've never ever heard a person introduce themselves based on their identity markers even me as a minority in singapore i don't do that but here in america i see it so often what do i mean by this as a male christian asian immigrant as a black gay man as a two-spirited female muslim immigrant in these cases people are using their identity markers to introduce themselves before they speak similarly to how a person with a phd will get introduced or how a physician will get introduced in a hospital this is dr so and so and the title doctor gives them some credibility as well as making them a subject matter expert in the specific field of study now this is the question is it problematic to introduce yourselves with these identity markers well it really depends if you are trying to share your experiences then using these identity markers may be helpful because everyone experiences the world very differently also listening to people with very different experiences listening to them carefully can be very helpful in coming up with real life solutions in society but a very big but if you are using these identity markers as some form of social cloud some form of moral authority or some form of your ability to discern the truth where your truth is directly correlated to the hierarchy of oppression that you're in then that becomes very dangerous and problematic number one your identity marker is not correlated to your ability to discern the truth or your moral authority your lived experiences may be true for you but it doesn't speak for everyone else including those who look like you or share in the same identity markers as you and the conclusions that you derive from your experiences are not infallible in aaron or beyond scrutiny by virtue of your melanin your chromosomes your sexual orientation or your immigration status an example would be jesse smallard jesse smallard faked a hate crime where he said two white trump supporters beat him up in the middle of the night at 2am during a winter storm when the news broke everyone believed him why because he had two identity markers he was black and he was gay or some would say white male heterosexual protestants have no insight to truth or reality by virtue of their religion their sexual orientation and their skin color and this is why you sometimes hear men have no right to give an opinion about abortion because they are not female but that is a topic for another time scripture says in john chapter 7 verse 24 do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment and in isaiah chapter 11 verse 3 3-4 scripture says that god will not judge with what his eyes see or settle disputes with what his years year but he will judge with righteousness so truth-telling is central to the christian worldview unless you are god the father jesus or the holy spirit your identity does not determine your authority and if you are fighting for justice there cannot be justice without fact or reason and there cannot be justice without truth so that's all for today's episode make sure to like share comment and subscribe and hit the notification bell for all the good stuff coming up in awaken tv
