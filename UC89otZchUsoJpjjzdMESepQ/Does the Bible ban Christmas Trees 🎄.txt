does the bible ban christmas trees there are actually some christians who believe that the bible bans christmas trees so let me set the record straight in order to justify their claims their go-to passages like the jehovah witness is to quote jeremiah chapter 10 verse 2-4 but what they're actually doing is cherry-picking and butchering scripture by taking it out of context so in jeremiah 10 it basically says a tree is cut down shaped by a craftsman and decorated with silver and gold isn't that the christmas tree definitely not one if you read the passages below is talking about cutting down a tree making it into an idol and worshiping a false god the larger context of the passage is talking about idol worship and honestly jeremiah wasn't thinking about the christmas tree in our living rooms when he was writing down this passage just because some people have done christmas into a materialistic holiday and it has lost its true meaning it doesn't mean you have to throw the baby out with the bath water merry christmas
