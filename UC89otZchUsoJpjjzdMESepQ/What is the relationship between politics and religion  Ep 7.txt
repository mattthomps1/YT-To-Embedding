[Music] whoa okay welcome to another episode of awaken tv with glenn before we begin make sure to smash that like button for the youtube algorithm and subscribe to the channel since it's election week the focus of today's episode is the relationship between religion and politics and i'm going to stir some feathers today two of the most common misconceptions i hear going around is the idea of the separation of church and state and how religions and politics should be kept separate the idea of separation of church and state as found in the first amendment in the u.s constitution says that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof some people imagine this to mean that the church shall not get involved or influence the government but if you read the first amendment it was actually written so that the government shall not establish a specific denomination like a national faith such as the united states of methodist or the united states of anglicanism it basically says that the government shall not get involved with the affairs of the church and tell them how they should operate the other misconception which is the main topic of today's discussion is that religion and politics should be kept separate that when you go to the public square you should park your religion aside and try to be as neutral as possible so that you won't let your religious beliefs influence the law of society essentially saying keep your religion within your four walls reducing one's faith to personal opinion rather than a proclamation of what is true this idea of neutrality is a myth because the public square is the battleground of the gods every decision passed in law is a decision about what is right and wrong what is beneficial and harmful and these decisions are informed by your personal values which comes from your belief system a person's values are principles and standards of behavior and every law is correspondingly based on principles and standards of behavior the idea that it's possible to separate people's values from the laws that are being passed is completely absurd especially if you are christian we cannot separate what we believe in the political arena from who we are in christ and what obedience to god demands even christians who believe that religion and politics should be separate that idea that religion and politics should be separate it's a value statement and they are appealing to their own faith to come to that conclusion as well put it this way it is impossible to separate our political and spiritual thinking each shapes the other the only question we have to ask ourselves is are we aware of our assumptions of god and are we able to articulate these assumptions and how these assumptions impact our political views and vice versa individuals who have not done the intellectual work asking what their politics say about god may be imposing their views upon god as much as anyone else only thing is they don't know it and the definition of god here is something that we look for all good in something that we find our refuge in anything that your heart realizes and depend on that is your god if one really believes that religion and politics should be kept separate then governments have no business on telling churches how to operate and what to believe and churches have no business telling their congregation what is right and wrong just and unjust because these have implications in law making let me put it another way if you think that politics and religion should be kept separate then you should not expect the church to speak out politically when bad things happen because then you'll be contradicting yourself but glenn what you are saying might actually go against my conscience well christians no doubt have the duty to obey their conscience but i would argue that there is a higher duty to be obedient to scripture after all as scripture says your conscience may be misguided and needs to be instructed by the word of god so how should we think about religion and politics there is no distinction between public and private in god's kingdom everything belongs to him and his rule is comprehensive there is no neutral standard of righteousness and justice only god's righteousness and justice and competitors against him politics is the business of organizing and governing social beings according to a certain standard of righteousness and justice and i like to say taxes are what we pay to a third party for not being able to live peacefully with one another like i mentioned earlier on the public square is the battleground of the gods the church is a political institution inhabited by citizens of heaven who have a distinctly unique political message jesus is king the local church is also a political assembly sort of like an embassy only thing that it represents a kingdom of greater political consequences to nations and governments a kingdom ruled by jesus we often think about politics through two parties but i'm here to remind you that there's an all-defining third party who has all authority over the universe and that is jesus whether or not you believe in him you are still obligated to follow his rule because everything under the sun belongs to him politics can be a matter of freedom or imprisonment free speech or censorship housing or homelessness life or death and that is why politics is an essential part of modern life it is how we govern ourselves and how we organize society therefore politics provides an opportunity for christians to represent jesus in a public square it provides us with an opportunity to love our neighbors through advocacy policy making and civic representation to refuse to engage in politics is to refuse to take advantage of a useful tool for god's work refusing to engage civically is failing to steward the things god has placed in your sphere of influence after all how can we as christians be salt and light of the earth if we fail to engage in society especially in something that has a big and broad impact in the country that we live in christians should engage in politics because it provides us with an opportunity to love our neighbor by acting justly seeing humans flourish and our communities prosper to close this out a correct doctrine and understanding of god will lead us to a better understanding of how we can be the hands and feet of jesus in society biblical literacy will lead to political literacy when christians aren't applying biblical principles to their political opinions then i hate to break the news your political opinion is being guided by something else that is not christianity so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this
