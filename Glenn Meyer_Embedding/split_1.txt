[Music] whoa okay welcome back to another episode of awaken tv before we begin make sure to smash that like button for the youtube algorithm and subscribe to the channel since we are still in election week the focus of today's episode is why do christians vote differently and how do we think through this isn't it interesting that christians in america read the same bible worship the same god but yet when it comes to voting they vote very differently it almost makes you wonder if they are reading the same bible or if they are worshiping the same god the trend that we tend to see is that white evangelicals will vote for the republican party while black protestants will vote for the democratic party even though this historically wasn't always the case so why do christians vote differently the reason why christians vote differently is because they prioritize social issues differently so while most christians would agree that abortion is wrong i actually hope you agree that abortion is wrong rather than believe it's okay to give people a choice to murder a baby so while they agree that abortion is wrong some of them will still vote for politicians who still support abortion because while they view abortion as wrong there are other social issues such as the disenfranchisement of the black community that they prioritize over abortion and because they prioritize things differently the voting results and the way they vote are different so the question is is there a way to think through on how to prioritize various issues i'm now going to go to the realm of applied ethics and provide
