s not when we had perfect theology not when we were out protesting in the streets not when we were deconstructing systems of oppression because what you did not earn through moral perfection you cannot lose through moral imperfection now that we've understand what the gospel is is social justice a gospel issue well a question you need to ask yourself is this is social justice a part of the gospel or does it stem and flow from the gospel if we think social justice is a part of the gospel then that is a gospel plus message because what we are saying is this this is the good news and these are some things that you need to do this is good news plus fill in the blank which ends up making it a works based religion therefore minimizing the gospel because as i said earlier on the good news is good news because salvation is not dependent on your performance based on how scripture defines the gospel i think that it is clear that social justice stems from the gospel it flows from the gospel but it is not a part of the gospel now i am not saying preach the gospel and do not do any justice or do not do any good works what i'm saying is this not only are christians obligated to preach the gospel according to micah we are also required to act justly love mercy and walk humbly before god essentially bringing eden to the rest of the world adam felt jesus succeeded and now as followers of jesus we are called to make disciples of all nations so that's all for today make sure to like share comment and subscribe and hit the notification bell for all the good stuff coming up on awaken tv
