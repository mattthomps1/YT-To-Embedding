[Music] whoa okay welcome to another episode of awaken tv with glenn in today's episode we are going to focus on the topic is social justice a gospel issue now when it comes to any topic it's very important for us to define our terms if not we are going to be talking past one another because most of the time if we actually take the time to listen to the other person we will find that we have more similarities than differences now if you are a christian and you rely on cnn msnbc abc and fox to be your pastor or to tell you what the gospel is rather than the bible then that's going to be a very big problem and we have bigger issues on our hands social justice may mean many things to different people i'll leave that for another video it is not as important as the point i'm trying to make today whether something is or isn't a gospel issue so what is the gospel the gospel translated from the greek word un galleon literally means good you so what is the good news the good news is the message of salvation in first corinthians 15 scripture says that god sent his son who was born through the line of david as the man jesus who died on the cross was buried and rose from the dead so to summarize that the son of god became man who suffered and died on the cross for our sins so that we will not be kept out from god's family he rose from the dead so that he could overcome death and be with his father our father the one true god forever and the reason why that is good news is because our salvation is not dependent on our performance jesus christ died for our sins while we were still sinner
