 you with a framework to think through some of these issues for starters christians believe that morals are objective or absolute and that objective standard comes from god objective meaning that there's a fixed tenant of morality that transcends everything regardless of what society your individuals may say under this branch of moral absolutes there are three varieties but for the sake of time i'm going to cover two of them the first one is called the unqualified absolutist i'm going to call this group a people in this group believe that something is always right or wrong regardless of the situation the second group is called the hierarchical absolutist i'm going to call this group b people in this group believe that there is an objective moral law but there is a hierarchy and some moral laws are more important than others so how does this pan out practically especially when there are moral conflicts for example in the case of rehab who'd like to save a life or people who are hiding jews in their apartments and they lied to the nazis if you are in group a you will say no i will not lie because lying is always wrong and inexcusable it is wrong it is a sin and we are forbidden to do things that are wrong on the other hand people in group b will say that jesus thought that there were weightier matters of the law in matthew 23 so you know saving a life is more important than not lying so yes i will lie to save a life they will view weightier matters of the law saving a life as being more important than lower matters of the law that is lying so how do these principles apply to
