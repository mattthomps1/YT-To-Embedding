ortance of it but that being said it's easy to push it off okay we are back in Action we have a coffee um it's too hot it's too hot going from smoothie to Coffee not good okay the other thing I want to talk about once you have figured and identified when you are most productive throughout the day and decide to make that your time to learn you need to actually make out a plan so I'll show you on screen here a little example calendar I guess you could call it that goes through how I plan out my learning so as you can see I don't learn every single day because it's not realistic based on everything else I have to do in my days but in the mornings I always allocate one to two hours for learning time not sorry not every morning but every second morning and I only do this throughout the work days the weekends I completely take off and this is because for me I find it best when I have one or two days usually it's one day on Sunday to completely recharge versus working a little bit in increments this is not something that's completely unrealistic to be learning every day or every second day whatever it is but you need to prioritize that and for me in order to prioritize something I have to have a reason why am I going to prioritize this why does this matter so for example for me right now at work I need to learn nexjs I don't need to but it's something that we use a lot at work and if I'm speaking to other developers and educating other developers about this about next.js I want to be able to be proficient in it I want to have built projects in it really understand it the fundament
