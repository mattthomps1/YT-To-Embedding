how do companies store my passwords in their database like can they see what my password is well for one thing it's important to store passwords in a way that even if the database was compromised the hackers could still not easily get them this is why you never want to store passwords in plain text in your database it's important to use a modern hashing algorithm hashing is a one-way function which means it's impossible to decrypt a hash to get its original value second you need a solid password assault is a uniquely generated string that is added to the password during the hashing process well why would we need to do that if they can't see what the original password is from the hash function there are ways that a hacker can overcome one-way hashes by adding a unique salt to each password it further ensures that the hash is unique to each password so when a user logs in how then do we validate the password that's stored in the database we first fetch a salt for the user from the database then we append it to the password provided by the user and hash it then the computed hash is compared against the hash that was stored in the database to see if they match
