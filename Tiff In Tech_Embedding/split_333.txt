install and p y t t x x three and this is actually a module that is a text to speech conversion library in Python and this is going to be a huge help in getting us to convert our text into speech go next up we need to install py PDF and I already installed this as well but I just want to go through the process with you to ensure you understand and this one here that we just installed is a python Library used for performing major tasks on PDF files and in this case we have a book PDF so any PDF you want to turn into audio put it in your project directory okay now let's get into some coding the fun part so first of all what we need to do is open the PDF so let's call this PDF reader I told you we can't spell today and then let's use this package here [Music] and here we are going to pass in the PDF in this case mine is called EDF foreign we need to initiate speaker you could use the other package [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] text strip the text [Music] foreign there then we want to actually take that speaker and save it to file to save it as an MP3 I pass in the clean text and what do we now we pass and whatever we want to call is MP3 file I'm going to call it story time [Music] then we stop it all right moment of truth [Music] here we go we can see printed printed out text and we have our MP3 this is really simple it's really fun easy project I need two modules from Python and it's a really really simple thing to build but you can imagine how powerful it can get when you are using large PDFs if you want specific Pages there's so much you can play around with this
