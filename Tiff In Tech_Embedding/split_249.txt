 one more flow though so let's say here let's go back into our code
snippet say we want to document around the search results and why we are returning what
we are returning and how others can get other data from that so let's go add and scroll
down we can see it's up to date here but say we make some changes here again so let's go
back into our vs code so we can see here now in our git repo that
we have added the new P tag and the result Max height and if I go back and swim you can
see here Auto synced snippet you can see that it's out of date so we have this was of course
the old auto sync by swim and then the new here we want to accept it or reselect it and
of course we want to accept it so that's another great thing you can always be up to date with
your code and it really highlights any changes that are made throughout the document now
you can also go commit one change and simple as that because we added this code snippet
in and we haven't committed it yet okay another thing I want to share with you is about smart
tokens so essentially what they allow you to do is you can type in your backtick and
then type in your token reference so this could be a variable a class and swim will
actually suggests content from multiple repositories so you can see here my two repositories now
I feel like this isn't the best example of that rather I'm going to share with you on
screen here an example where they are doing the front and back end repositories this is
a really great example of when you maybe want to utilize or reference something from a different
repository especially when yo
