h can you guess the first one I'll list I'll 
give you a second here if you guessed python you   are correct and it's probably no surprise mainly 
because python is used among many different roles   from data scientists web developer QA python 
touches a lot of roles and is used for many   different things I really think that is one of 
the reasons why python continues to dominate on   a lot of these lists another reason is because the 
entry to learning python is pretty straightforward   now let's go back and have a little bit of an 
understanding as to how python originated python   was originally developed as a hobby project which 
sounds crazy now just how much it exploded it was   mainly developed for emphasis on code readability 
no surprise here and also its syntax allows for   programmers to express Concepts in fewer lines 
of code well yeah sure give me a sec so so why   should you even Learn Python well for one thing 
all the big tech companies big and small typically   use Python to varying degrees another reason is if 
you are first starting out in your coding Journey   python is a very is one of the better languages I 
would say to start with because of its readability   okay the most important question where do you 
learn it what course is the best now we are   entering an age where the problem isn't where to 
find courses it's there is so much information   out there how do you decipher which ones are 
the best enter in the complete python bootcamp   from Zero to Hero in Python one of the reasons I 
really like this course is I actually took this   course man
