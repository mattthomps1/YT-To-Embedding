go well frankly 
sideways having a cyber security specialist for   human humans that have chips in them or different 
Tools in them is going to be needed because the   reality is with this also comes the ability for 
hackers to hack into humans this sounds so strange   as I say it out loud but yes this is something 
that might potentially be needed in the future   if we end up going the way that Elon Musk and 
others are really pushing for with implanting   chips in our brain once again I feel like I'm such 
a crazy person for making this video but it's so   fascinating thinking about what the implications 
are what the pros are so many Pros having access   to AI information right in our brains and 24 7. 
I'm sure there'll be more Geniuses so many more   Innovations but on the flip side it does come 
with the risk of having technology part of us   and the ability to be hack cyber security human 
specialist officer that is a title next up is one   that if you've watched my short form videos you've 
heard me talk about which is space tourism guide   this one gets me really excited I'd love to be a 
space tourism guide with different companies like   SpaceX and blue origin making specifically really 
large improvements in the world of space when it   comes to getting normal citizens to be able to 
go into space and putting normal citizens into   space that will continue to grow and evolve at a 
quick rate and now this isn't something that's the   future this is happening now but having a tourism 
guide where you can imagine people are loading   onto spacecraft going into space
