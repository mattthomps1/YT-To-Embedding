n openai has trained language models that are very good at understanding and generating text so their API provides access to these models and can be used to virtually solve any task that involves processing language so this we are going to build a simple application so let's scroll down to an example so if you see here introduction prompt write a tagline for an ice cream shop and it will complete with different prompts so it's pretty cool that you are able to interact with their language models once you have the basics down you can build like your own mini chat GPT essentially or whatever you want to build so let's scroll down here and let's get into where are we going here build your application let's use node for this and let's start by cloning the repository copy pull up a terminal that's what happens when I have too many things open I was playing uh snake let's just terminate that I did that the painful way that's okay all right so as you can see my terminal is here I'll try and zoom in just so you can see the terminal more clearly and let's see let's decide where are we let's go to our desktop always dangerous putting stuff in our desktop and do git clone all right and then we can see here navigate into the project record directory and make a copy of the example environment variables file all right perfect so let's open up our vs code because that is where we'll be going to do all right I think what I'm going to do is put this as half can I make this half and half come on student instructions is half and the other part of the screen will be vs code I think that makes s
