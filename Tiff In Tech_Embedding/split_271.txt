seen but have personally made and I wish I had advice along a lot of these actually all of them pretty much are is advice that goes against what is typically told I think I gave a lot of advice here that goes against the grain because sometimes we take this advice too seriously and we need to step back and actually go the opposite way which I just shared with you today I hope you found these tips really valuable and helpful not only if you are just starting out in your Tech Career but no matter where you're at in your journey I think interviewing is something that is terrifying at all stages or at least for me it is I don't like interviewing and I like talking to people but it's one of those things that the more you practice the better you will get at it and just be yourself because at the end of the day you want to work for someone who really values and respects your true self all right that is it for today leave in the comments any questions you have I always answer every single one of your questions and comments or I try my best to and take time to read them all because there's really nothing more that I care about than supporting you and your career growth and your personal growth because you all mean a lot to me and I've been in your shoes and I'm still in your shoes depending on maybe you're more advanced than me and we gotta do it together it's one of the best things we've got to lift each other up support each other and I hope I can do that for you so any questions thoughts comments leave in the comments hit that subscribe button I think that's it I think I covered
