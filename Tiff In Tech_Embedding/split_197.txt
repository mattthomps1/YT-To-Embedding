job right out of University went to a 
coding boot camp I think I was paid 40 000 dollars   Canadian which would be like 30 000 U.S so it was 
I was very I was underpaid if you look at numbers   where you should be paid when you join a company 
when you start out but I'm so excited again that   I just I just took the job the problem the biggest 
mistake with this though isn't even about taking   money out of the equation take title out of the 
equation it's that if you are going to end up   settling at any point in your career you're going 
to start resenting where you work you're going to   realize hey I'm really underpaid I deserve more or 
why is this person making so much more than me and   this person doing so much more than me and in turn 
you're going to want to leave that company sooner   than expected because you're unhappy and that's a 
huge mistake because you want to be able to grow   and nurture your relationship with that company 
build experience there before moving on to the   next now in my case I stock it out but I gotta 
be honest as much as I enjoyed the work enjoyed   the team and all of that the back of my head it 
was always you know how I made a mistake how I   shouldn't have settled and definitely would 
never do that again and and another mistake   that I made when I was first starting out and I 
sometimes catch myself still doing which is not   good is pretending that I know more than I do now 
this doesn't come up in interviews because it's   very clear I think during interviews as to your 
knowledge and I'm not talking about that what I'm   talk
