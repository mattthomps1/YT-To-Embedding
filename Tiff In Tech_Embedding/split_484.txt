want to do it   with a partner with someone that they know like 
a business partner so how did you know that it   sounds like a dating question almost but how 
did you know that you two were right for each   other for creating a business like was it kind 
of nerve-wracking going into it with a friendship   uh were you was there any kind of fears of that 
or absolutely not i think that because of our   background and where we came from we started off 
working together we freelanced together we also   seen different relationships we knew exactly what 
we wanted and what we didn't want and we were on   the same page about it and like kate mentioned 
earlier our skill sets are so complementary   so it just was it went hand in hand and then 
we're also super chill people so it wasn't like   complicated it didn't feel like someone was out of 
line or like someone was in each other's like lane   it just it was like a puzzle piece it fit it made 
sense and i feel like it's rare you know we don't   always recommend friends doing business together 
but i think it just really like worked hand in   hand for us and we were lucky that way yeah yeah 
and i feel like we both even say that like there   isn't somebody else that we could see each other 
doing it with just because it is really hard   with a friend like if you don't have the same 
work ethic or the same like work style even so   i feel like the fact that we did start in a work 
relationship it's like we know how the other works   we know what we're bringing to the table from both 
sides and i definitely get the appeal of wantin
