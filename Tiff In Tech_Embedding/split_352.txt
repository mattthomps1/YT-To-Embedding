om me okay let's get started but I'll go somewhere else okay when I started 
making this video I was going to do a vlog style   and I promise you more Vlogs are coming to Tiffin 
Tech about my day-to-day routine but as many days   they're crazy busy so rather than vlogging I'm 
just going to walk you through my day the first   thing I've been doing recently in the morning 
actually before we get into developer relations   and that just to tell you a little bit about 
my morning is I've been going to work out in   the morning so I get up at six every day leave 
the house by around 6 30 and go to Pilates and   this has really helped me gain Focus throughout 
the day I felt like my days were often so fuzzy   and I was tired and I just needed that boost of 
energy and honestly working out in the morning   has been a huge Savior for that I feel like then 
now throughout my days I'm more productive more   focused and honestly more happy when I get back 
from my workout I always take some time to do some   Tiff and Tech emails and focus on that for the 
first part from I would say about eight to nine   my workout's from seven to seven fifty get back 
do Tiffin Tech content and emails and then at 9   I start my day now there are really three main 
areas that I focus on in developer advocacy one   being developer education another being content 
and the last being community and a lot of times   these three pillars overlap of course you know 
with content being for developers with Community   intertwining with developer experience so it's 
all kind of intertwined in a way or oftentim
