ngs that really helped me was I found   myself starting to speak out loud to no one or 
sometimes to Paul my boyfriend but mainly it was   just to myself and the purpose of that was when I 
started teaching or speaking out loud about what   I was learning I actually learned where there 
were holes in my knowledge Gap or where there   were gaps in my knowledge I saw okay I'm able 
to speak about this very well but I can't really   talk about this part of it I need to go back and 
revisit that and that's something that I still do   today all the time when I'm teaching or going to 
be learning a new technical topic is taking a step   back and speaking out loud you know you're going 
to look like a crazy person especially if you're   just talking to yourself but to really understand 
as far as where there were gaps in my knowledge   also speaking about learning new technical things 
or new technologies coming up I wanted to say a   big thank you to orox for sponsoring this video 
the oryx wallet is really designed with its users   in mind so it allows for better storage tighter 
security smarter insights all at your fingertips   also there is no sign up or download 
required in order to join the waitlist   I linked it down below so make sure 
to sign up today so you don't miss out   also it's really important if you are interested 
in this to sign up now because it's very exclusive   and it's only actually accepting a limited number 
of users to begin with so okay let me explain   a little bit of how it works the wallet really 
rewards its users so it's similar to the way Amex
