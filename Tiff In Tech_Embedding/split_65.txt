etwork people who needed projects but I was really lacking that Community or mentorship that would help me succeed as a freelancer those are the two main things that made me realize very early on I did not want to do freelancing I think if I was to look back maybe I would do things no I wouldn't do things different but I do think that that's important to recognize right out of the gate which is honestly almost more important than having a huge network of people to develop projects for is having a community or understanding if you are someone who needs that Community to support you if you get stuff on a coding question or a coding problem as you are building or whatever kind of field you are working in when you get stuck on a problem it's not like when you are at a large company and you have tons of people help you you are on your own you need to figure it out on your own or build that community on your own next let's talk about pay how do you how much to charge a client when you are just starting out now if you're using one of these websites or a freelancing site there might be some suggestions there you can also sometimes not always but sometimes see what others are charging and go based on that but here's my biggest tip or what really has helped me when it comes to when I was freelancing for the development side of things or if I am taking on an independent client for developer relations what I do now what I will do is I will simply ask others meaning if I see someone else in this space doing similar work I will reach out to them on LinkedIn now you might be thinking Tiff
