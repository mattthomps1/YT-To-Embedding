for now just internally high energy Tiffany okay take two take three take four I don't know today 
we are going to be talking about my journey into   developer advocacy and developer relations 
this is a question I've been getting asked a   lot recently is what exactly is a developer 
Advocate what do you do and today I want to   talk to you about what I do coming from five 
years of strictly software development into   developer relations I'm going to share with you 
about what I do on a day-to-day basis uh what it   really entails to be a developer Advocate and 
hopefully give you kind of more insight into   to what I do but also to to the role itself 
and if I seem a little confused when I say   that it's because giving you insight into the 
role itself really varies uh company to company   person to person and I'll get more into that 
throughout this video but hopefully you will   leave this video with knowledge on what the heck 
do I do and also what a developer Advocate is to   maybe see if it's right for you maybe you're
