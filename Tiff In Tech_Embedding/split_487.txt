 congratulations   thank you that's huge i feel like our team is 
like such a huge part of our success and like   where we are even and it's obviously only been two 
years and there's now 11 of us including nur and   myself and it's crazy to be able to like look at 
that and see so many other people like having that   same intention as us and like feeling the same way 
about it i think that [ __ ] has given us such an   opportunity to not only like bring out what we 
want to life but also like give our team that   opportunity and like bring them in that sense and 
everybody's been growing into their own roles so   well in the beginning similar to when we started 
it's like you wear every hat and you do everything   whereas we've gotten to more of like a stable 
place now that each individual can do what they   really love and like focus on and i think that's 
just been like a huge part being able to see like   how happy they are and excited about like coming 
into work so i think that was like the biggest   moment for us but definitely agree with nara that 
there's never gonna be a time when you're like   i made it i'm successful it's like always thinking 
about what's coming next and like what more you   can be doing to get there yeah exactly exactly 
if you're yeah you're right if you're thinking   i've made it i'm so successful then you're you're 
putting too low of a ceiling on yourself or too   low of goals you always have to be continuing to 
to reach for more and if you're like comfortable   in the position you're in it's it's not going to 
stay you know things are g
