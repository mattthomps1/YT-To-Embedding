ne thing to another that's very that's very cool 
um oh sorry and and during the I want to say like   these internships were like quote-unquote data 
science internships because at startups you really   wear many hats yes so Not only was I doing data 
science or like I also got to call it data science   because the the co-founders were like oh yeah you 
could you could call yourself whatever whatever   you want whatever whatever's got on the resume 
I love that that's something I always I always   like when people are first kind of starting out 
and it's similar to what I did when I was first   starting out is a great way to to really get your 
foot in the door or uh through internships there's   many ways but one way I found for myself and it 
sounds like for you as well is when you go with a   smaller company or a startup there's so much more 
typically more freedom or flexibility to kind of   try out different roles or wear many hats and and 
even kind of you know massage your title a little   bit you know to whatever you you fall in love 
with so that's really interesting that that's   how it happened for you um yeah I did everything 
at these startups from like data entry but also   like marketing and like front-end development 
so I was many things yeah yeah I love that   um as you know data science is such a such 
a popular role right now and everyone's just   like how do I become a data scientist I feel 
like um do you work with a question that that   I get asked not necessarily of course around data 
science but in general is uh you know do I have to   maybe they'r
