y increase by 39 percent   stated by Forbes again continuing to grow and 
grow so there are so many options and the last   thing I want you to do is as you are seeing 
especially right now with AI or with web3 as   you're seeing these things become so hyped and a 
lot of times for good reason I'm not saying there   isn't reasoning behind them but don't just keep on 
pivoting from one to the other rather stay focused   on your path now for example let's give a good 
example as to how you can continue to stay in   demand say you are a web developer I'm just using 
this as an example but this could be related to   really marketing to any kind of skills you have 
you're going you're focused on your path well the   best way to kind of continue to be in demand other 
than networking and building those soft skills and   relationships is just get curious now what do I 
mean by this all right we are off even based on   those stats and numbers I just shared with you 
it should be even more reason to realize that   maybe the best way to stay relevant and stay in 
demand your job your career in demand is to do   this opposite of what everyone else is doing so 
what do I mean by that the more I think about it   and the more I strategically think about my 
career I realize that rather than just going   with the trends and focusing on what everyone 
else is doing the problem with that is you're   never going to actually become an expert in any 
area you're going to try out this trend and then   you're quickly going to realize there's a new 
trend coming around you know web3 AI whatever is
