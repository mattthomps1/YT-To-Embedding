you need to know   if you are just starting out start out 
with one programming language and there   might be some debate around this I find but I 
think starting out with one typically there's   always different use cases is a really 
good way to go because you want to focus   on learning the fundamentals you want to focus 
on learning the basics and what that will do is   if you are able to really grasp that later on 
in your career when it's required to learn more   languages it'll be easier to pick up because 
you actually have a strong Foundation versus   you skim the fundamentals and went straight 
to a programming framework the next question   I get asked is well what programming language 
to learn first and it really depends on what   you want to be programming what you want to be 
building so I'm going to list more generic ones   overall overarching but take this with a grain 
of salt in the situation of depending on what   you want to learn so if I was to go all over again 
I would learn as I mentioned probably python first   but other great ones to learn first would include 
JavaScript or I would say Java those are the three   main ones if you are going the self-teaching route 
that are something that you can learn on your own   and easily pick up and there's a lot of resources 
online about them which really helps too also if   you're wondering Tiff why aren't you going to your 
co-working space I thought you're getting coughing   going there I got locked out so we're just going 
for a walk around Toronto and talking and walking   a very casual friend intimate w
