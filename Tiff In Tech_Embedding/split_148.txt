ets smarter and smarter but it's not going to be instant and I always get this question well Tiff is it still worth learning the basics the fundamentals of programming absolutely just like anything you need to build a foundation and if you are someone who is learning to code or already did learn to code it is not a waste of time it is one of the best things you can invest in yourself it's kind of like a sales but do this it's one of the best things you could do but it's because I'm so passionate about it because it changed my life and I see the impact it has on others lives it doesn't mean you necessarily need to become a full-time programmer for example or whatever but understanding how Tech is built is so powerful as it is literally changing and building our world and what better way to be part of that than understand to some degree at least how it is built and you can do that with code so yes if you are thinking of learning to code I would highly suggest still doing so you need those foundations and then from there you'll continue to grow you'll use AI tools along the way and that's totally okay that's actually great you should embrace and adopt them as well and on that note because AI is going to have such a rapid change or rapid pace for how we code and how we program not only should you keep up with AI tools I think it will become something that you need to almost like when you are learning to code you learn how to install vs code for some people or or you learned how to use the terminal now I think it will become you also learn how to use different AI tools not sayin
