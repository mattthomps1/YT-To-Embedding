 works best for you to start learning   do that even if it might not be the quote-unquote 
correct way or the way people are suggesting   sometimes in order just to start something new 
you need to do what you are comfortable with or   what you know works best for you and if you don't

with learning to code is because they're learning   how to learn which sounds kind of funny but it 
really is a skill in itself another thing that   happens more often than not is we learn too fast 
when you go online you see all these articles of   how I became a full stack engineer in you know 
two months or how I landed my first job in two   weeks or I don't know just ridiculous things like 
that and it puts subconsciously a lot of pressure   on ourselves that we need to learn everything so 
quickly but what that really does is we end up not   learning anything because we don't learn anything 
well another thing that really didn't work well   for me when I was first learning and still to this 
day I need to have I'm someone who needs to have   support and everyone's different a lot of people 
I've seen some incredible programmers who are   self-taught and never had to ask another human 
a question but just you know went on stackable   they asked another human but they just went on 
stack Overflow and asked that way I am someone   who gives me all of the support you got let me 
you know take all your advice and insight and   when I was learning to code I actually hired a 
mentor I hired so
