that's why I included it 
on the list if it was super easy and everyone   was doing it it it wouldn't need to be on this 
list essentially at the end of the day one of   the biggest things about having a place where you 
can focus and having a workspace to focus isn't   about the size or the grandness of it but tidy up 
a little space I've seen a lot of friends of mine   actually who are in the situation where they're 
working from home and there's a lot going on and   they don't have the space to do it what they will 
do is actually make a little corner for themselves   designated corner and put in a little desk maybe 
you buy it off Amazon maybe you buy it off of   wherever it is and just own that space that this 
is where you are working the one rule is though   when you are not working do not go in that space 
even if it's you know a corner or a little side   of your your kitchen table whatever the case 
is only sit there only go there when you are   working what this will do is it will naturally 
or subconsciously tell your brain that when   you are sitting there you are to be focused now 
this isn't a perfect cure-all but it definitely   for me anyways I've seen it significantly help my 
office I do not go to do any work on the weekends   and the doors are literally closed to the office 
all weekend long I don't go in here to watch you   know things on my laptop or journal or anything 
like that it's completely off limits and it's very   intentional because then when I do go in on Monday 
like okay my body is ready to work my mind's ready   to work and it knows what t
