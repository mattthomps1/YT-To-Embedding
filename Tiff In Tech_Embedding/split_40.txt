en for myself anyways I have all of a sudden started to build faster more efficiently by using tools like chatting CBT or Genie which is another AI tool extension that I really love for vs code there are so many options out there and the reality is if you want to use these they're at your fingertips and you can build really quickly with them now I'm not saying they're perfect but it definitely is revolutionizing the way we code whether it's here today that you are using it as well it's going to change the way we code and if you're someone who's hesitant or nervous to say no to if we're not there yet asked chatgpt to build to an application or website and it will do it in seconds the reality is though it's not perfect you still need to understand code you still need if you're working on Enterprise level software you're not going to be using a lot of these AI tools because they're not going to be allowed and even if they are allowed you still really need to understand code you're still building your own code it's more like a coding assistant one area though that I've really seen helpful when it comes to these tools with software development is having your tests write it or wrote written your tests automated for you essentially that is an area that no one really likes to do manually is writing tests it's so important but yet we often fail to do it until it's too late and this is something that will make the whole process send faster when you think about bugs introduced in the code there will be less of them because these tests will catch them when you think about qa's role it
