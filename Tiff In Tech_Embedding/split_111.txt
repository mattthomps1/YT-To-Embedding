 is what does it entail and maybe every company is a bit different but for someone who isn't as familiar with the role or curious about it yeah so chief of staff is I would say a relatively new-ish role in popularity in Tech I would say it's come to the industry maybe five or six years ago um and it actually has its background in politics which is interesting like the role of chief of staff was um like presidents would have chief of staffs as advisors so they were separate to their day-to-day staff and their function in in politics was to be a third party advisor to someone in power right and so Tech now five six years ago adopted this role because they realize that if you think about an executive let's say a CEO of your company or a CFO or something like that they typically have a bunch of people that report to them right they could have hundreds thousands of people that report to them and they all have different functions yes and they all have maybe interests that are within their own teams right they they're not unbiased in their incentives so the idea of a chief of staff is you are reporting to your executive but you don't have um a specific scope within that team so that you can be somewhat of an unbiased third party and so realistically when I think about the chief of staff role it's so different based on who you support some chief of staffs are highly analytical some chief of staffs are highly focused on communication yeah and org management and so it really sometimes Executives look for a chief of staff that's like their clone right like they're an extension of them
