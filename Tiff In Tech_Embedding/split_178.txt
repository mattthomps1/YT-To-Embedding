I being such a widely used tool I   want to share with you some other tools that you 
can use that maybe will help you in other areas   in your coding career and I'll list them down here 
okay in this video we are talking a lot about chat   GPT of course because it's mainly the one that's 
been hyped up for so many of us and honestly I   actually really like using it it's very I know the 
data hasn't been updated since 2021 but otherwise   it's still extremely valuable and helpful and I've 
really found it helpful in my career thus far this   brings us to the question though what programming 
languages should we focus in on to use these tools   most effectively the first programming language 
I'd probably focus on is Python and also too I'm   walking through Central Park during this video and 
let's check out this view so I had focus on python   is because it's so versatile there are so many 
areas that you can use it there are so many things   you can do with it and it's one of those things 
that if you are just starting out in your coding   career and you don't necessarily know what route 
you want to take do you want to be a front-end   developer back-end developer data scientists there 
are so many different roles that's starting with a   programming language that is as flexible and 
widely used as python is a great way to go also   too I've been doing a lot with chat gbt and Python 
and I feel like it really likes Python and knows   python so it's a great programming language 
to start learning with the help of AI another   programming language that I would really sugg
