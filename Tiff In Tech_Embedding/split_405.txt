tion so we're gonna   enable fast content creation on top of that but 
the design part of things uh was slightly kind   of like you know in the back of our mind but 
not really a focus because we were like okay   designers are building in figma developers 
will develop whatever they're building on   from figma on stack with and they will build 
it in a componentized way so we'll have compo   we we already have like designers uh can you end 
content creators can just use their components um   like their their crafted personal components that 
they created on figma on sketch or whatever they   did and and then they can reutilize them really 
fast with like you know a component Library great   and now suddenly um we were like huh actually 
we can like just seamlessly integrate figma into   um our structured content um our methodology 
yeah and what happened is Joe one of our solution   Engineers was able to create that integration and 
it was pretty it's still pretty mind-blowing yeah   it's still evolving but right now what he um kind 
of like unlocked is the ability for um designers   to sync their design system into um into stack bit 
meaning let's say you have a website on stack bit   you will usually what you'll do is you'll 
have your components kind of like build under   um like design system guidelines yeah and 
your design system and your components are   probably held in like uh in between products 
such as like storybook or something which is   which is all your components all your design 
system implemented in code right so you're   maintaining it basically on stac
