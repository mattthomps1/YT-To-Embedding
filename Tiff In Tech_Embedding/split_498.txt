it to our client are we looking at someone in the   beauty space in the influencer sorry in the skin 
care space and the tech space like we find kind   of people that appeal to our client and we look at 
their demographic who watches how do they engage   and are you yourself are you just you know pushing 
whatever and i think that's where when we find   influencers we connect with and we believe what 
they're saying that's when we find the biggest   like conversion um within our campaigns that's 
huge and i would even say that there's almost two   sides to it and like from the social side it's 
more like what is your goal so is your goal   selling it and is it like getting the exposure and 
marketing around it or is it the content because   so many brands struggle with content i feel 
like because like we said it happens so fast and   there's so many changes in it that if your goal is 
content um they're technically still influencers   but like we highlight them as content creators 
and so they might not have a huge following   they might not have a crazy engagement but if 
they're creating the content that your brand   needs that's going to be so much more valuable 
for you to be than using on your page so it's   really what the goal of who you're looking for 
is and then trying to find that right person   when brands come to you or companies come to you 
do they usually have do they know what they want   or do they come to you and be like we kind of 
know what we want but can you help us figure it   out almost i don't know if that makes sense it 
depends yeah sometimes ye
