 stack bit and the 
whole thing is synced to your design system and   it's pretty magical it is really magic that is the 
future I know it is the future it's it's unlocking   so much potential it's it's like um I was trying 
to explain the value of this because the majority   of our team is not designers yeah I was trying 
to explain the value that I see in this and   I was like okay you're all developers right 
like say imagine that you're locked into the   um code editor of like the episode or whatever 
yeah but vs code but a limited vs code okay   like a viscode that sits inside like a no code 
uh um right like you have like a little window   that is kind of like curated according to what the 
platform allows so imagine you're coding in that   versus really coding on a local vs code right 
I see what you're saying yeah that to me is the   difference between trying to edit and tweak within 
stack bit or any other visual editor versus doing   the things in figma yeah in theory I can get 
the same results it will just take me 10 times   like slower yeah and it means for a lot more 
potential in mistakes along the way and it's   the inconsistency is real yeah it's real it's 
a real thing right like you have to maintain   consistency across three platforms yeah which is 
nuts it is nuts and it's not anymore why sold I   know I know I'm gonna link uh more information 
on down below because it's for anyone which is   pretty much everyone watching this interested 
in design or technology is really fascinating   um and uh yeah so link some resources down 
below also to get us off
