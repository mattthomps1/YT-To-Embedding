ng I love 
JavaScript because not only can you use it on   front end but you can also use it on the back end 
side of things the original name for JavaScript   was mocha it was developed in 1995 for use with 
Netscape 2 browser and honestly in my opinion   I feel like they should have stuck with the name 
mocha because too often especially probably when   it was first developed between Java and JavaScript 
people would get confused hopefully not anymore   but I think the names you know it's not the 
best even though they're completely different   now what course to take for JavaScript this was 
a tough one because JavaScript I feel like there   are just an overload of courses for JavaScript and 
how do you know which one is the right one to take   this course I'll put on screen here really stood 
out to me the complete JavaScript course from 2023   from xero to expert and why it stood out to me 
well the first thing if I'm being honest is the   number of ratings it almost has 200 000 ratings 
it has almost a million students 700 000 students   with a 4.7 star rating so you know based on the 
numbers based on the data this is a good course   already by just looking at that another thing 
that stood out to me is just how quickly they   updated the last update was this month in November 
and I also like to how it's structured in a way   where you can start at the beginning from beginner 
just starting out or if you're someone who already   is a developer but you aren't as familiar with 
JavaScript you can start at the beginning to learn   the fundamentals or there are projects
