 it and being able to speak about it those skills are huge huge and yes we still will be writing code but it won't be those mundane tasks and what that will allow us to do is free up our time to think bigger picture I predict in the next five years we will see so many more programmers become founders of companies become CEOs or ctOS of companies well they already do go that path but we'll really see the spike in programmers becoming thought leaders because we aren't spending our time day on and day day in day in and day out working on mundane tasks but rather we can think bigger picture which to me is pretty exciting okay let's do an example of this so when you think big picture or when you think that these programmers become thought leaders and I'm not saying we aren't already please don't take does that but I'm just saying I think we'll see more going in that direction imagine if you can well we already can I mean I was playing around with whisper API yesterday from openai and imagine you can train AI systems to develop more Innovative programs and at a quicker rate than that that allows you to continue to build and iterate and fail see what works and what doesn't work at such a quicker rate and programmers will be really at the heart of that okay this is a really cool spot by the way look at this a little reading Nook here tip number two or Point number two of what the future will look like for programmers what happens when you are not spending your time debugging or working on these smaller tasks what it allows you to do is be able to upskill when you look at the job ma
