what does this code do and it does tell you that 
but there definitely is need for the human touch   still so let's give this a try just for fun 
here copy code [Music] so it's looping over   each item in data and then appending the item 
to price all right this is good and then let's   go over here for price and prices if price is 
under 300 let's use the notification employer let's open up our terminal a bit and let's see what happens when we run this oh you know what I was getting this error 
before so type error list must be integers   or slices not strings so right now we're getting 
a string back okay so I'm not going to show you   in this video but I was getting this error 
before and I literally that's how I started   playing around with chat GPT I was sharing 
with chat GPT this error and finding other   ways to resolve this so I'm going to actually 
update this code to the way that I resolved   it so you know why it was causing that error 
is because I wasn't using data so as you can   see here I'm actually not using data at all 
so I can get rid of this and now we can see   we are going through looping over the response 
in Json format which then now should work so as   you can see here using notification in the from 
plier you can add in title message app icon and   for this case it's not under 200 it's under 300. 
now let's run this and it should work no usable no module oh yes we need to install this I got 
this as well no module so let's go pip install   so this is another module within plier now let's 
try again we're gonna get this one time [Music]   my fri
