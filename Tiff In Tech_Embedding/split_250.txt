u're working on large teams with multiple repositories
working on the front end back end and want to understand everything also too one thing
I love about swim is you can actually integrate them into your IDE and you can see here I
have swim on screen and I need to connect my repository but I'll actually show you a
diagram that they have of what you can really do with swim so you can see here docs sit
next to your code which is beyond handy I can't even tell you I mean you know and also
too there's Advanced markdown editor you can actually be editing the docs right within
your IDE so you can essentially just stay working in vs code or whatever IDE you are
working in and you don't have to go back and forth which as we know if we do have to go
back and forth we oftentimes just neglect the documentation all right so I linked swim
down below so make sure to go play around with it check it out this not only I think
is good for those of you who or many of you who are working on a team at a large company
of course this is beyond useful for that but I think it's also useful if you are someone
who is just starting out in your career or earlier on it really will set you apart having
this documentation included in your code showing that you actually understand documentation
you care about it and you're using this really Advanced tool to build the most beautiful
and functional documentation all right it is if you see outside right now it is snowing
like no tomorrow so I feel like it's end of the work day for me I need to go to relax
let me know what you think of swim I linked it down b
