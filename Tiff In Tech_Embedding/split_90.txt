rs per se but understand how Tech 
is built and how it operates is going to become   more and more in demand that's just my personal 
take based on the way things are going and what   we have seen thus far so I guess the point of 
that ramble is if you are worried about should   you still break into Tech or should you learn 
how to code now is a better time than ever if   you ask me I know the jog Market is not ideal now 
where we're not going to cover that but if you are   looking long term I think Now's the Time actually 
this is completely impromptu but I was just doing   doing a video on this extension for chat GPT and I 
just thought why not add it in this video speaking   of future Tech let me show you okay you can see 
my screen here this is very candid I'm doing this   and I just installed this plugin it's called 
Genie by openai it's open source and what it   does is it gives you some shortcuts for your 
code so you can see here there is tests find   problems optimize explain complete code so what 
I have here is a super super simple script it's   really basic but even if you do something where 
it's like let's do add tests and then you can   see here how quickly it is generating the test 
this isn't sponsored or anything I just found   this plugin I thought was really cool and it's 
connected right to open AI I had to put an API   key in from openai to use it and so that's how 
fast it just generated some tests you can also   do say I want to understand these tests I guess 
maybe so highlight it and then go down to explain should explain this code is a unit test o
