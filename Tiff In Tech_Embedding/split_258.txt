years from now where   what does that look like to you does it look like 
going into an office every day does it look like   leaving a teen collaborating with people building 
really interesting technology what does that look   like to you and of course through our different 
experiences and as we grow as people this will   change to what we think we want today to what 
we want in the future but it really gives us a   good sense and a good roadmap as to what our wants 
and needs are and where we want to be growing and   that's a huge aspect too for me example when 
I was thinking about what I want in the next   five years I knew I wanted to be remote I knew I 
wanted a high paying salary there's nothing wrong   with that I knew I wanted flexibility those are 
the three things and is there such a world where   you can get all these three things well yes of 
course there is and one of them being the career   path that I chose and I love that I was able to 
tick off all those three boxes that were really   important to me now maybe some of these are less 
important to you and and one or two of them are   more important to you or maybe they're all equal 
but it's really key to understand as to where you   see yourself in the future so you can align your 
learnings and your career goals based on that   for me even if I'm not at my complete dream say 
I wasn't I am but say it was not my complete   Green Path or dream career just knowing that 
you're actually taking the steps to get there   itself is so rewarding and fulfilling I 
think that you can be like you know what   I know
