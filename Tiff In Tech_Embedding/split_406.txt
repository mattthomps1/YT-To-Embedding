k bit on on figma 
or whatever you're maintaining it on on storybook   yeah uh in code yeah and then you'll do it in like 
your web platform yes what not so that requires   a designer constantly updating and iterating and 
changing a developer one developer maintaining a   storybook or or a similar product and then someone 
doing the front end and like always syncing with   everything right um so what we're doing now is 
with stack but you're basically making changes   on figma and they automatically update um either 
on storybook or on uh it's not actually not sorry   they will be updating um we're we're integrating 
with storybook as well so you can either think   from storybook or from figma or skip one of them 
but it will automatically just update on on your   website on your live website so we started with 
tokens which is colors typography spacing all   that we're shifting into like component changes so 
you know you'll be able to easily change like The   Styling uh like a box a block a button whatever 
so that's already functioning working and we also   have a very clear path forward for how we're going 
to manipulate layouts uh create new components   with new models like our stack but we will be 
able to read proper content models from stack   from figma so yeah in theory and not so Theory 
and I I believe that very like soon with stack   bit you'll be able to just Define a new let's 
say section by dragging a few components that you   already have on your component library on figma 
and hit publish and then that section will show   up in your component library on
