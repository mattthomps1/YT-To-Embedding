at you want anything you want really the whole thing is you can prompt anything in here and it will return the response so this is super cool right above this one here get response I am passing in my API key I should put it in its own environment folder but I'll share this link to this Ripple down below so you can play around with it too once again you'll need an openai API key that is free you just might hit your number of uh tokens that you can use for free so that's just a side note anyways just want to share we got it working okay let's dive into using GitHub co-pilot honestly from being totally honest I don't think I've used it enough to really appreciate it because thus far I've been using uh Genie a lot which I was having some troubles with uh because my API key expired on it but I really like it it uses chat or it uses GPT 3 I believe and it's just more user friendly I think it's because I've been having some issues getting GitHub co-pilot to show up in my vs code in this panel here but you can see down here it is installed we have it right down here no I do not want to disable I am paying for it 10.99 a month I think which is kind of crazy but I just wanted to try it out so one thing you can do is you can write comments and it will help suggest code for you so let's do that in the use case of we have say we didn't have this API key or we wanted to put some constraints around it so let's do uh check if API is configured else give an error okay so then it's not going to necessarily just write out code for you right out the gate you still need to be able to code of co
