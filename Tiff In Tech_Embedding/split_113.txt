g and a project is across the business there's no natural owner yeah that's where I would come in so I may be parachuting for two to three months clean up a certain thing and then move on yes um so it's somewhat similar to Consulting and that's why yeah yeah but internal yes yeah um and then you report directly to your executive so you can clean things up move them quickly and move them faster and I actually did a corporate strategy role previously so that's most similar to this part the job yeah um and then the last bucket I would say is um it's like people management and the people side of things yes so I um I manage my executive executive assistant uh I also oversee a lot of our people initiatives so I'm sitting on our women's board and and planning certain events focusing on diversity focusing on hiring focusing on um interviews so really the people side of things is the last bucket of of the role and so it varies like one day I could be deep in a model doing some kind of financial analysis and the next day I could be thinking about our growth strategy and then the next day I could be thinking about hiring people right and so that's what I really like about this world I think it's very varied um and it's very uh different yes but I don't think it's for everyone for that reason also yeah so kind of on that note and I want to get to get to get to that last point it's not for everyone as well but but going back to okay first of all that role is intense in the best way possible but you know if you're someone who adapts to and thrives in that environment of working in uh wea
