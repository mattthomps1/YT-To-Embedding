I can   do tomorrow be kind and gentle to yourself work 
in Ebbs and flows you're not going to be you're   not a robot you're not going to wake up every 
single day feeling the most motivated possible   and like you can work the hardest or Focus the 
most every day it looks a little bit different   and when you can structure your work days around 
how you are feeling and I know I know it sounds   kind of sappy we're talking about feelings here 
but it is so true for example if you wake up   and you need to do a really difficult technical 
task but you're really not feeling motivated   look at the backlog of things you need to do 
and I'm sure there are things on there that   maybe are less mentally taxing on you that you can 
focus on for that day it's unrealistic to try and   get everything done at the same Pace every single 
day and rather than trying to do that and in turn   burning out or just resenting your work go with 
Ebbs and flows acknowledge how you are feeling   because there are going to be so many days where 
you do feel like taking on those more difficult   tasks that you really need to be motivated and 
productive for no one is going to like hearing   my next tip and I understand why which is keeping 
a clean or tidy workspace now you might be saying   yeah Tiff that's easy for you to do because you 
have an office a space to work out of I work out   of my kitchen I work out of my living room with 
kids running around to screaming whatever the   case may be I'm acknowledging that everyone's 
work environment is extremely different and   it's challenging and
