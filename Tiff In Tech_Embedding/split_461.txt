SVP of engineering at slack charity Majors CTO   and co-founder at honeycomb and Lewis Tapp

it out I linked it down in my bio so you can   check out who is speaking uh one thing I like to 
do before conferences is really check out who's   speaking and then also to think of ways to follow 
up with them after the conference it's a great   way to kind of you know start a conversation you 
heard them speak you really appreciated certain   points that they made and then kind of open that 
conversation up that's just a little side tip also   speaking of networking and mentorship there is 
a live event to connect with speakers and other   audience members so if you are there make sure 
to come say hi to me virtually and you get access   to the dev interrupted Discord Channel this is a 
great way to also interact with other engineering   leaders now a question I get asked a lot is do 
I have to be an engineering leader in order to   attend this conference the answer is no no matter

conference that you'll find a lot of value   from I linked it down below go sign up today did
