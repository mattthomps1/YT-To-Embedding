re and why do   you enjoy networking actually I don't mind it but 
when I first started out in my career networking   was such a painful thing to do and it was because 
I was so nervous are people going to like me for   who I am are they going to ask me something 
that I'm stumped on you know I'm supposed to   be this technical person what if they ask me a 
question I don't have the answer my I going to   look dumb all these thoughts kept on coming in 
my head and really affecting my ability to put   myself out there to network and it also brings 
up the question well where to network there are   so many places out there do I have to go to in 
person do I do online are people burned out from   going online to network where do I start this 
isn't a question that's just occurred now it is   something that I think has been asked throughout 
time in many different forms so I'm going to share   with you some tips that really helped me with 
networking first being recognize what kind of   person you are and what I mean by that is how you 
communicate best for me when I get in very large   settings especially around people that I'm not as 
familiar with I get really nervous my face gets a   little bit red or a lot red and I stumble on my 
words I feel myself get more nervous and then   in turn I get more nervous and I recognized early 
on that I don't do well in big crowds now this is   something that throughout the years with practice 
I am now much better at but initially when I was   first starting to push myself to network it was 
a big struggle for me and how I overcame that
