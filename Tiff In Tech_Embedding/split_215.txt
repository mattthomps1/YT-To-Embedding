portant I mean look at myself I started my career you know completely not in Tech in fashion and modeling switching into learning how to code going to a boot camp becoming a software developer for the past five plus years and then transitioning into a developer Advocate role so focused more on the community and educational side of things but if it wasn't for my understanding of code and my background of technology I wouldn't be able to do this and that continues to trickle in so many areas of my life and I'm using that example because regardless of if you can see yourself coding forever or not it's still such a great skill to learn and I think we need to start looking at coding less like uh only as a career path but more something we should all learn uh and continue to grow our skills into varying degrees I know a lot of high schools now are teaching different coding skills which is amazing and I wish I had that at my time but I didn't but yeah I think to sum it up still learn to code it's extremely in demand it really makes your resume stand out whether you want to be a developer or not and AI is not going to take over your job as long as you do continue to learn an upskill I just really don't like that quote that keeps on coming around of you know if you use AI tools then you're safe it's like not necessarily it's okay like we have to accept that AI will take over some of the smaller tasks and allowing us if we are continuing to learn an upskill to focus on larger ones so I think it's kind of like a that was way too slow it was way too slow kind of like a win-win in my op
