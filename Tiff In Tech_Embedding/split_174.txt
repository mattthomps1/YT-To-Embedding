another thing that really helps you find that   motivation when you're trying to focus is actually 
creativity now don't give me the tip I'm not that   creative a study that was published in the Journal 
of positive psychology researchers found that   people who engaged in creative activities were 
more likely to feel motivated and engaged in   their work this isn't just stuff we're making up 
here this is science for me what I will do is if   I'm feeling very unmotivated and can't focus I'll 
actually just go for a walk listen to a podcast   creativity can come in so many different forms 
that it doesn't necessarily have to be you are an   artist and wanting to paint this gorgeous picture 
or or you need to journal although journaling is a   huge creative outlet and I highly recommend it but 
there are so many different forms essentially take   a break and do something for yourself and this 
will really help break up your day also too it   will help reset your mind okay I hope you enjoyed 
this video going through that a lot of times it   isn't the work itself killing your motivation 
it's the habits or mindsets that you are doing   or not implementing I hope this video was very 
helpful and insightful these are takeaways that   I use in my everyday life and they really help me 
be able to focus and be motivated for much longer   extended periods of time if you haven't already
