ting that uses the principles of quantum metrics to process information so unlike classical computers which uses bits to represent information such as zero or one I think we all are familiar with that at least quantum computers use qubits qubits I think that's what it's called quibits can represent both one and zero at the same time so essentially if I'm putting this away essentially from my understanding is quantum with Quantum Computing it can solve multiple problems at once so it's really smart at not it's it's really quick let's put it this way one area that Quantum Computing will really create a lot of new jobs that we're already seeing is with cryptography currently many encryption systems rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their Prime components with a quantum computer though running Shores algorithm could potentially solve this problem much faster so how will Quantum Computing potentially affect your job what how does it like who care is quantum Computing great Quantum Computing not only will create a ton of new jobs such as the cryptographers that already exists but are continuing to grow but also too it will be ingrained further into our everyday lives especially with say software engineers if you think about software engineers and how Quantum Computing might take a play into it think about the way software Engineers may need to develop new programming languages algorithms to optimize a performance of quantum computers companies are going to want to get their hands on Quantum Computing as fast as possible the idea that quantum computers can sol
