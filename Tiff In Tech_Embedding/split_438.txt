ry low   lows when you are learning to code the funny thing 
is it's not just when you are starting to learn to   code it does get better as you get more experience 
because you have the toolkit to learn new things   and learn them quicker however there definitely is 
times where you will still face imposter syndrome   even 10 20 years in and you pick up something new

myself who didn't pay attention in high school   really to math or Sciences I just didn't seem

have to I didn't have that side of my brain that   logic side of my brain that is used in programming 
that wasn't a strong suit of mine to begin with so   as much as I was learning how to code I was 
also learning how to think in a new way how   to problem solve in a new way and I think that is 
something that a lot of people discover when they   are starting out in their coding journey is that 
this is a whole new way of thinking and problem   solving another thing that happens way more often 
than not is that feeling of overwhelmed kind of   like I am in this rain right now trying to walk 
the dogs but when you start learning to code or   learning something new in Tech the first thing you 
will quickly realize is there i
