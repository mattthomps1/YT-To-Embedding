I feel like it's always at   capacity I'm gonna buy I'm gonna upgrade I think 
I'm gonna pay all right let's start explain to me   like an engineer I think that's really important 
too to put how you want it explained so do you   want to explain like a kindergarten teacher 
do you want to explain like a chef how do you   want to explain well my crisp microphone 
okay explain to me like an engineer what   the benefits of using python are let's 
just start with something really simple okay you can see it gave pretty high level of 
why python is so in demand and why you should   learn it but it's really good to start with 
understanding that why is that's one thing   I really missed when I I didn't do until later

I just started building and that's not   a bad thing but at some point in your journey 
you will have to answer those questions those   whys because that will differentiate you 
from a great engineer to an okay engineer   all right let's get a little bit more technical 
here let's ask it um give me an example of how to   python script and explain to me what it does so 
let's start getting into some examples like we'r
