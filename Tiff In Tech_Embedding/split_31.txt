ing to get AI to help you with all this when you think nowadays when the first digital camera came out or uh let's stick with that example it's not like at the time people were like or maybe they were like oh this is going to completely take out photographers all their jobs are going to be gone we have been continuing to evolve with technology and the roles that technology is helping us with we continue to evolve as well with so it's not something that's going to take over all of our jobs or if it gets to a point where it does take over all of our jobs it's not just in Tech it's at that point it will be all of our jobs taken over but I really don't think that will happen in turn what I believe is we will have more room in space like we always have to continue to build interesting things and continue to build new ideas creativity it's gonna allow for more time for us to focus on the bigger picture things so it's doing some really interesting things and these are just five tools that I'm obsessed with from a coding productivity standpoint but they can be used really for so many different use cases I just wanted to hone in on those two that I'm really passionate about alright I hope you enjoyed this video leave down in the comments if you have tried any of these tools if I miss one that you're like Tiff this is an obvious one you missed and hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related videos see you all soon bye everyone [Music]
