AI has made a huge impact on programming over the span of under a year think back to November with chat GPT how this changed the way that programmers learn how to code it completely revolutionized how we think about code the way we code in such a short amount of time and it can't help but bring up the question well if this is all in under a year what does the future hold in five years for programming with AI will there be programmers even around is there a point in me still learning how to code and today we're going to be covering just that what will AI programming look like in five years this is something I spent a ton of time doing research on on the plan so I'm going to share with you in this video not only predictions but also back them up by some interesting facts and data points and so you can have an understanding of is it worth learning how to code and if you are learning how to code where should you start from should you still start from the basics what will this mean in the future will it still be a good job or will it be a very ordinary job this is all really exciting to me and that's why I'm filming it while I'm in the middle of paradise let let's get into it [Music] actually as a side note because I learned how to code about seven eight years ago been coding professionally for six years now I look back at what I started and I feel like Grandma insert like wig here of of gray hair because I go back in my day we didn't have ai to code with we had a code from scratch we used stack Overflow now it's the reality is you don't even have to use stack Overflow typically
