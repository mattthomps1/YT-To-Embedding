you learn new things but when you are asleep you   actually refine them making it easier to retrieve 
them and apply them correctly when you need them   the most this is important for how we learn 
but also how we might help retain healthy brain   functions so think of it as sleep as a win-win you 
get to relax go to sleep but you also are helping   improve your brain no one wants to study more than 
they need to let's be honest here so using some   of these techniques to learn more efficiently 
will not only help you retain information have   better recall but it will help you save time in 
the long term too many of us have been learning   in the wrong way and I say that meaning we get 
taught one way to learn and that's the only way   we can do it or that we've ever done it we need to 
start looking for other Alternatives other ways to   learn based on research and studies in order to 
find what works best for us at the end of the day   if you are someone working in Tech you're going to 
be consistently constantly learning so it's really   important to try out some of these methods and 
find what works best for you all right I think   I've done my work here for the day if you haven't
