 actually allows your brain 
your mind to have time to digest what you have   learned versus if you are just studying for long 
periods of time you're not allowing your brain to   really digest what it just took in what it just

and I came across this really interesting survey   it's called sq3r and I'll link it down below as 
well and they really Share three different methods   to studying three different kind of patterns that 
you can use so I'll put it up on screen here one   being sq3r method pq4r method and thieves method 
and as you can see on screen there's different   ways that you really can learn different kind of 
patterns and I think it's a great thing to follow   and and I'll link down to they have a survey for 
which works best for you and take that survey I'm   going to take it as well actually and to see kind 
of what ways your mind will learn best and I think   it's important to play around with this but I 
really like the research and study done behind it   okay another thing that I do and I didn't even 
realize that this had a technical or actual name   to it but it is called retrieval practice and what 
it is is remembering at a later time so oftentimes   what I have found that I like to do is when I'm 
learning something new I will go on Quizlet or any   of these sites where you can make different kind 
of cue cards or flash cards and I have the app on
