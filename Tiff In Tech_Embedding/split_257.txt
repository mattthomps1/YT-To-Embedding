t importantly what I have not   enjoyed and through that I quickly discovered that 
for me one of the big things is I like The Best   of Both Worlds I love technology I love code being 
in the weeds with it but then I also love people I   love teaching I love educating can I combine that 
in any way well that's how I ended up in developer   relations and that's my dream career and I am 
so excited about that but it took a lot of time   I mean you've seen me grow so much through this 
YouTube Channel Through Me sharing my honest and   authentic journey in Tech and that even what you 
land your first job your first career maybe it's   the right industry and you're very passionate 
about this industry like I am about technology   but then a few years in you're just like you 
know what this career path this role path is   not for me it doesn't mean completely jump ship 
and abandon the industry but rather take a look   back at your experience and think back as to what 
you enjoyed and didn't enjoy and if it's more   you're not enjoying maybe a big company culture 
or bosses that will give you good insight as to   what the real issue here is is it that you're just 
completely burnt out and over a certain industry   and career path or is it you just need a change 
and something to kind of switch it up another   big thing for me is visualization I know you're 
probably thinking Tiff I don't want to visualize   like what are you talking about but just just 
hear me out on this one if you take a few minutes   and really think about where you want to be in
