d's ability to provide users with access to their data remotely so you can access your personal data and information wherever you want or wherever you are located imagine a world just as a side note imagine a world where we were only able to access these things because location dependent imagine all these digital Nomads or Travelers not being able to work while you're traveling I can't I can hardly imagine that world and next up on the list is machine learning one way I like to really understand or put simply what machine learning is think of it as a way from how you can learn from your experiences or get better at certain tasks over time this essentially is the purpose of machine learning or one of them machine learning can learn from their experiences and also improve their performance but of course instead of using human judgment or human experiences it uses statistical techniques to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns for example let's use a machine learning learning algorithm that is trained to recognize images of cats by analyzing thousands and thousands of pictures of cats over time it will learn to identify common features of a cat image so say it's pointy ears or whiskers once algorithm has learned what a cat looks like it can be used automatically to recognize new cats in pictures and one common machine learning algorithm that I'm sure we are all to some degree familiar with is neural networks neural networks simulate the way the human brain works with a huge number of linked processing nodes they are good at recogni
