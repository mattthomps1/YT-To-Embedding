using bright 
data is its ability to quickly and easy integrate   data from different sources this can save yourself 
the businesses you work for resources and Time   by eliminating the need for manual data entry 
and Reconciliation all right let's dive into it   foreign okay so as you can see on screen here I 
am logged into my bright data account and you can   focus on proxy infrastructure web data platform 
in this case I'm already going to go into the data   collection platform and go into collectors now 
in here you can see I have some data sets I've   been playing around as I mentioned with bright 
data already so that's why there's some existing   ones for this though I'm going to go through 
developing a new self-managed collector and kind   of going back to the beginning of this video we 
are going to be creating a Amazon product search   that searches for iPhones so for this they already 
have some templates that you can build upon so go   develop a self-managed collector and then from 
here you can see there are a ton of different   templates now you can start from scratch you don't 
have to use one of these templates this using one   of these templates I found really helped save 
time and you can modify them to your specific   needs which is a benefit as well so for this 
let's go Amazon product search use template okay so as you can see here it already has some 
code for you it's already doing the pagination   for you too which is huge and let's go into scroll 
down you can type in a keyword what is the latest   iPhone 13. let's do iPhone 11. let's keep it this
