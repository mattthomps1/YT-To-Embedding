 only for today if you are looking for a job that will be secure for a long time but also by 2030. cyber Security Experts will not be overtaken by AI or automation you need the human touch the human intelligence to understand what is good what is bad what is allowed what we should prevent what we should not prevent there's so many different things so this in my opinion is the number one skill to learn if you want to continue to be in demand for 2030. now the next question might be well how do I get into cyber security the good thing is because this is probably now one of the best times to get into cyber security actually because there is a need for so many more cyber Security Experts that they aren't having this very hard limit that you you need to graduate with this specific degree to get into cyber security they need people so if you are willing to spend the time taking a course online or a certification online whatever the case is there is a job for you that's that's as far as you need to go you need to be passionate willing to learn take a course or some certification to show that you are really taking initiative and from there I'm not saying it's as easy as one two three but you do not need to go back to University necessarily to get into cyber security Now this can depend on what role you want to do so do research on it of course but at the end of the day the demand is so high for these roles or people with these skills that you do not need to necessarily go back to University or college just start by doing your research and probably just take a course online next up
