   your specialization yeah right yes and so that's 
where I was kind of lost like I didn't know I was   more like a generalist yes and at Grace Hopper I 
found data science I fell in love with the idea   of experimentation yeah um and yeah the rest is 
history wow I've never been to the Grace Hopper   conference which is so sad to say yeah yeah but 
it's on my it's on my like very near bucket list   like hopefully the next one um I think because the 
last two years I don't even know I think last year   it was in person right uh this year was in person 
and then the past two years was virtual virtual   yeah it's way worth it to go in person yes and 
yeah next year we'll go like as speakers I love   that yes yes putting that out there yeah that's 
our goal for next year yeah yeah we're putting it   out there I love it you went to Grace Hopper after 
you this all occurred after you graduated college   or was it during it was during my sophomore year 
of okay nice nice and then so from there did you   did you do an internship first or how did you 
kind of uh what was the next step from there   when you discovered data science um so after that 
I actually took a gap year in between community   college and university um I did a nano degree 
on um Udacity okay for data science so I that's   where I got my background in SQL and Python and I 
took that Gap year to focus on modeling full-time   that's when I first moved to New York it was 
really exciting and um I did internships after   um after my junior year of University I see I 
see and then it kind of just organically yeah   o
