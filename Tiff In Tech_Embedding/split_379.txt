go oh if you haven't hit that subscribe button   support me and also leave in the comments other 
topics you want me to cover okay now let's go the first on the list is called retrieval practice 
and this is the concept of remembering at a   later time so how exactly does this help for one 
recalling an answer at a different time than when   you're actually learning the material actually 
helps reinforce learning more efficiently than   just trying to study in your textbook this is 
similar to the concept of flashcards actually   writing down what the answer is on a flash card 
and continuing to repeatedly look at it and   remember quiz yourself is way more effective than 
simply looking reading and thinking you you know   this if you are someone who practices retrieval 
learning it is more likely based on studies that   you will remember this information retain it 
for a longer period of time this is something   that I did a lot when I was studying in University 
especially with flashcards little tip Quizlet is   amazing for flash cards at the time when I was 
studying it was free I still think they have a   free version anyways we're getting sidetracked
