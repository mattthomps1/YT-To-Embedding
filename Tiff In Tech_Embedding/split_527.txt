t's get into these courses the meat and bones the bones of meat I feel like that's that's not right let's get into the iOS course so meta's iOS course really covers from beginning if you've never even developed an iOS or worked with iOS at all to expert and job ready and how they can do that in such little time well I mean you're learning from experts in this industry so they know what to cover they know what's really important when I look at the course I can see that it starts with an introduction into mobile application development followed by Version Control I love that they cover version control because it's something that so many courses Miss and I see this really affecting people in the interview process not to mention when I went to a boot camp and then went into the interview process with very little experience when it came to Version Control and they were asked questions around it it's an area I completely flopped in so I really give them credit for including Version Control next up is the programming fundamentals in Swift and one thing when I was looking in this course and playing around with it that really stood out to me is yes of course they are focusing on the unique aspects of Swift syntax but also too they cover the fundamentals of programming in general I think it's one thing to be a developer if you know how to code in in Swift or in any language but if you understand the fundamentals of programming as a whole it will really set you apart as a developer so I think it's really great that they do that next up is principles of ux and UI design as I mentioned
