so I recently got a new job as a developer Advocate and with that of course comes a new computer so I thought I would give my terminal a little makeover which is so funny because I've been a software developer for five plus years and I've never really customized my terminal so I really wanted to get into it so here's what I did okay the first thing I did was install item which is essentially a replacement terminal for mac and what I was really excited about is it comes with a bunch of different features such as split screen uh hotkey then I installed oh my Z shell and this is something I've installed and played with before of course for plugins and themes but I wanted to check out the themes uh and see if it's something I wanted to use and the last thing I installed which I was so excited to play around with is Starship and what I really liked about it here let me show you it makes everything very configurable from editor completions to okay this is small I really liked it you can insert new lines in between shell prompts okay now I'm going down a dark hole what am I
