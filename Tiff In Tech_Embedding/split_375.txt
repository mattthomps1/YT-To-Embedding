ou are   done taking this course a really great way or 
thing to do that I do and I'm taking a course   is a project that I really liked or resonated 
with I'll build it again without the tutorial   but build it in something that I'm interested 
in for example in this course one of the things   that you will be building is an animated dice 
roll so what you could do after you've done   that example is you could start by building 
an animated object that you are interested in   maybe something other than a dice and this is a 
great way to take your learnings and apply them   to your own projects last but definitely not 
least on this list is I got the green screen C plus plus we couldn't end this list without 
C plus plus it's been around for a while it is   a classic and it's not going anywhere C plus 
plus is a powerful general purpose programming   language it can be used to develop operating 
systems browsers games and further now where   do you learn C plus plus put it up on screen here 
the course that I really enjoyed I started taking   this course I'll be honest with you I've never 
used C plus in my work so I was just curious   about it to understand it and have a have a deeper 
understanding and I think that's one of the things   as a side note that's really interesting about all 
these courses is don't just take them just because   it's what you are going to be using currently 
at work if you are curious about something why   not take it just to learn something new I don't 
think we do that enough this course really stood   out to me when I was looking for C plus
