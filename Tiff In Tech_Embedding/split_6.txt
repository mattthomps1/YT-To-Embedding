hen also too it's used for text processing and manipulation Pearl has built-in support for advanced regular expressions and Powerful text manipulation features so it makes it a good choice for tasks such as data extraction parsing logs or transformation of text files so although there is still some use cases for Pearl I definitely do not think it is worth learning nowadays in 2023 when there is so much more out there to put your focus to last but definitely not least on the list is something I ordered dog food and this is what I get let's try that again last but definitely not least on the is Adobe cold fusion and this is something that I hadn't heard a lot about but I was really curious as to what it was used for so Adobe cold fusion is a web application development platform that was introduced in 1995 by Allaire alaire Corporation and later acquired by Adobe so cold fusion was used for creating Dynamic data-driven web development or web applications using a proprietary scripting language so some of the common use cases for it included CMS systems it was used to build and maintain CMS platforms e-commerce applications data driven applications and also to web services and apis sounds really interesting so why the decline of this technology well to a few factors one in which we are all very familiar with I hope anyways which is modern web development Technologies came around such as PHP love it or hate it PHP is one of it's the opposite of this list it's something that is still very in demand so many websites use it and I know it can be painful to pick up and learn or a lot
