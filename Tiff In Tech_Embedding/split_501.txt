 a different sound and 
i just was watching it and i'm like wow like as a   creator myself i'm like there's no attention span 
it's so little anymore that you have to catch them   in one to two seconds like literally 
just like what what and then he'll   stop and he'll watch for a little bit one and 
then it will be going again and going again   yeah it's really interesting from like a human 
behavioral side of things yeah i watched um a   netflix documentary i'll send it to you later 
i can't remember the name but it was like   it was all about it was from the founding 
team members at facebook at google at snapchat   whatever and they were just talking about how 
turn your notifications off just like trust   us like already we are just our job is to come 
up with ways to keep you in the app internally   longer on the pages longer and obviously this 
is against our job because we're also like   how do we capture people's attention longer but 
as humans and as like individuals like we say this   all the time we need to disconnect from our phones 
like we work all day long that's eight hours that   we need to be on social media like it's not like 
an office space where we're like put your phones   down and work yeah exactly you need to be on the 
outside immerse in it we eat breathe sleep so   sometimes we're just like oh turn it off yeah like 
just shut it all off shut it all off all the noise   so do you think for anyone who's watching this who 
wants to get into who wants to be an influencer or   content creator i know you mentioned uh niching 
down is always a good way t
