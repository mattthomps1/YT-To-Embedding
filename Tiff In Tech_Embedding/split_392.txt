rabilities lie it's a very   interesting career and I had a good friend 
of mine who is a cyber security engineer and   getting to hear her stories not only about 
the the apps she was testing at work too   but external ones and what's kind of going on 
behind the scenes it was really exciting but   it also is very terrifying just how vulnerable 
I think a lot of applications are some other   responsibilities for cyber security Engineers 
can include penetration testing so this means   evaluating an organization's computer networks 
applications and data systems for vulnerability   so pretty much what I just said also to network 
maintenance so you might need to install test and   configure some networks and I.T system security 
so spending time defining protocols and installing   and configuring security devices okay that's a 
lot so you can see it's a very diverse job in   the sense that you get to work on a lot of very 
interesting problems now what is with such an   important uh job what is the salary for this okay 
for this I went on ZipRecruiter and I can see here   they say for salary not total compensation and I 
always really highlight those differences because   it's easy to get the two uh mixed up when you 
were speaking to people or speaking to friends   or whoever you're speaking to and I want to 
really highlight this because a lot of times if   someone says oh I make 250 000 a year you need 
to clarify okay that's great but is that total   comp or is that base salary because that's a big 
difference so that's why I always try and do that   in these videos is
