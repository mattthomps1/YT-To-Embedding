ensure I am clarifying what 
I'm speaking to so this is for base salary and   the average national average is around 120 000 U.S 
so this definitely can go up extremely as you grow   in your cyber security career but also too you are 
starting with a very not 120 000 typically but you   are starting with a very good salary as well okay 
those are some of the top in-demand jobs or fields   in the tech industry that are going to continue to 
really grow in 2023 and I'm really excited to see   where they go because a lot of these industries 
or Fields I guess you could say within the tech   industry are just at the tip just starting out 
when you think about cyber security when you think   about blockchain these fields yes they've been 
around for a while but they have so much potential   and they're going to unlock so many other things 
that being a part of that is really exciting I'm   curious to know what specific field in Tech are 
you working in or are you passionate about or   want to get in leave down in the comments okay 
the sun is calling me I can see it from behind   you I need to go relax on a chair now thank you
