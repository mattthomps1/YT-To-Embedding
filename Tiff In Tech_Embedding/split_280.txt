ata one sec here all right so I jumped ahead a bit and just copied 
this code that I created I already did this   project and I'm redoing it of course to share 
with you okay so as you can see authorization   bear and then your token here content type 
this is a Json then let's use this requests   so let's go response equals requests get and 
then we are going to use the URL that was in here   to break data actually and copy this URL here 
okay we're recording screen as you can see on my   screen here I am now getting the response printing 
out the data as you can see so I thought we'd do   something really fun here uh let's let's utilize 
let's harness chat GPT we always talk about it   and is it going to take over programmers jobs and 
all that why not test it out so what I'm going to   do actually is copy this code here and go into 
chat GPT you can see I've been playing around   with it already for this and I'm going to paste 
it in and I'm going to say what should we tell   it to do let's say use this code to write 
more code in Python to get the prices for   prices for each object and notify the user when 
it is under 300 go 300. I don't know this might   not be word in the best way but this is really 
fun just to see what it does okay we're going [Music] all right that's good it's doing pretty good prices for item and data a pen item this 
looks really good like scarily good are   we out of a job no I think you know even to go 
through this part and get this code back which   I just did you need to understand exactly as 
to what you are typing in how to utilize it
