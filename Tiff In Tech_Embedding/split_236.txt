   next and you're never going to actually become an 
expert in the things that you're learning there's   no problem with being a generalist but if you're 
a generalist you need to be able to pick up new   things very quickly and that's the purpose you're 
purposefully a generalist if you're just picking   up new things because you want a higher salary 
it's not going to work or at least in the long   term anyways one of the best things that I really 
like to do is really helped me thus far in my   career is being open to evolving and growing and 
being really open to new technologies but having   a short-term or medium-term plan so meaning the 
next five years what does that look like for you   are you staying at the same company you're at 
and obviously this can change as you grow and   you your experience has changed but having a rough 
timeline and then as these new technologies come   up it's less tempting to be like I need to enter 
into companies around AI or I need to enter into   companies around X Y and Z whatever it is but 
staying focused on your plan because in turn   it will give you time first of all to see how 
these Trends pan out the other thing we'll do   too is position yourself as an expert position 
yourself as an expert in whatever role you are   in industry or in in Tech or sub industry what 
would you call it Niche industry I don't know   and it will just give you more credibility okay 
you know what I'm gonna film the rest of this   video in my car I feel like we're intimate we got 
a good vibe going on let's just like wrap it up in   this way uh o
