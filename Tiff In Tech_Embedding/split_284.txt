you'd be rich all right day of the week we're   gonna set the day of the week let's should we 
set the day a week what do you want every day   we want every day let's just do every day but 
if you want you could do day of the week like   I just did uh to get specific days all right now 
let's do our we want it to be 10. I'm gonna do a   minute two because I set it for 10 but now it's 
1004 so let's do 10 of 6. companies like that I   gotta double check I think it's like that 
then time zone will be TZ that we just set all right minute let me double check that this is 
how to do a minute give me a sec here okay so yes   this is how you do minute let's quickly change to 
eight save and I already started running this and   as I mentioned you have to keep this running so 
let's see well you can't see the time but it's   1007 right now so let's give this a minute and 
let's see if the notification pops up I know it   did because it already did for 1007. for some 
reason the notifications are giving me grief   when I'm using QuickTime so be curious to see if 
it actually shows up because last time I had to   insert a screenshot of it I don't know why it's 
uh kicking the notifications away with QuickTime   because that's what I'm using to record my screen 
but okay it's 1008 come on notification are you   gonna appear I don't know why it doesn't appear 
with QuickTime anyways I'll insert a screenshot   here because it will work on your computer it does 
work on mine uh it's just for some reason with   QuickTime it won't appear anyways okay we were 
able to make that within a few
