 media and what you share on social media it's hard because you know you or for me anyways I want to share more of the things I go through right but I'm also like people at my company follow me yeah so it's that weird and which you know being open and honest is um something they would Embrace and love of course but it's finding that balance of I don't want to appear to have it all together but at the same time I don't want you know what I mean like you don't want to be like you know used against you in a way or things like that that's one of the things I actually I don't share my age on social media yeah yeah um and part of the reason I don't do that is for that reason because I don't want to um I don't want people to think oh she's younger than I thought yeah right or based on your role experience or based on experience or like why would I listen to her she yeah barely has x amount of years of experience and so um I think that's that's very much the key and I think people when you share your experiences um some people appreciate it but some people will double down on the why her yes you know so we're talking about why me but then they might be thinking why her you know I have 10 years of experience exactly I have you know eight years yeah you know I um I went to this school which is better than her school or whatever it is yeah um and so sometimes you you self-sabotage because you're like I what gives me the authority to speak on this topic but I think typically what I think about is I'm not an authority figure I'm just here sharing my experience exactly your journey this
