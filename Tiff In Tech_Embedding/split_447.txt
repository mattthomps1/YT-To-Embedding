ed one take I wish I still had it but I don't think I do was one project I built was for my dad and he had a construction company so I built him a website with his logo and I put some houses on there that he has built some information it was terrible but he was so kind about it but it was oh it was bad this is why I don't have it anymore but the point of that being even if someone in your family or friend doesn't need a website at the moment or an app or whatever it is that you are specializing in you can still build something for them and you don't have to consult them on that or even talk to them about it but just be like hmm you know my mom loves baking what if I made her a website that featured all of her you know baking items contact information and start thinking humid that way like she's almost a client and that does two things especially if you are early on in your career your Development Career it really shows that you're taking initiative it looks like you're taking on clients they don't know it's your mom they don't know who this person is that you built the website for so that's another great way as well the third thing that I've been really finding inspiration in is through games I've been tinkering around a lot with python and if you follow me on Tick Tock or other socials you've probably seen me making different projects with python and it's just a really fun language to to make quick and fun projects with and for me I've been really enjoying finding different games especially retro games to build with it so that's another idea as well I know react of course
