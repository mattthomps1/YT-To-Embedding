the other didn't so it was great it definitely i'd   say started as a work relationship turned into a 
friendship um but i think like her when we first   met she was she didn't know me when we first 
met sometimes that's how the best relationships   though are formed you know what i mean yeah yeah i 
think it was needed yeah we say that we joke about   it now because the funny thing is how big started 
was entering the pandemic we moved in together um   it was you remember toronto had the worst 
lockdown ever and we couldn't go to each   other's homes you couldn't really leave your house 
there's so much that you couldn't do and we wanted   to start a business and we couldn't like work 
would take so much longer to do it on zoom and   kate's an incredible designer and i am not at all 
i don't design i'm more on the strategy side but   i would send ideas back and forth and like the 
communication just wasn't working so she calls me   and she's like look my roommate just left like do 
you want to move in and i was like hell yeah yeah   dude we had no separation from each other 
it was like coveted lockdown we're forced   to live with each other we're working together 
non-stop like we literally shared forks like   we were just like inseparable for months i 
almost gave her covid in the very beginning   and you're still here together today so clearly 
it works it works yeah that's great um well   that's another question i had for you is a lot 
of people who are looking to start a business   or getting into more of an entrepreneurship type 
role some of them well most of them
