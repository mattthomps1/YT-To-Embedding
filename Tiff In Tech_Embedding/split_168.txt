le now let's get into quickly   how to publish this how to actually publish this 
okay here are the steps for publishing this on the   Chrome extension site so the first thing you're 
going to do is zip your project up and make sure   this contains all the files that we just created 
including your icon.png then you're going to go   to this URL Here sign into your Google account 
click on the add new item and of course read   through the agreement and if you choose to accept 
the developer's agreement essentially then you can   upload your zip containing all of your files and 
then they require you to send in some screenshots   of your Chrome extension and I think this is so 
they can check it out as well so then at this   point you can either make your Chrome extension 
free or a paid version and then essentially click   on publish changes at this point you have to wait 
till the review process is done which can take a   day or a few days and once it's done you will get 
notified if your Chrome extension is published let   me know down in the comments if you do this and 
what you end up publishing I definitely want to   check them out maybe I'll do some shout outs of 
extensions you make in future videos that would   be fun yeah let me know share with me the Chrome 
extensions you make and I'll share with them in   some future videos I think that'd be really fun 
also I link this code down below so if you want   to follow along through cloning this repository 
go ahead and do so hit that subscribe button   and let me know in the comments what what should 
we build next I l
