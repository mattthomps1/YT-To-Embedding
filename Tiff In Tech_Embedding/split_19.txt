hese things perfectly memorized to a t what we are building so I built it and then I record it that's a process all right it is updating packages what do we have here do you want import names search from Google Search from Google search import search query best courses on coding for I in search creativity I don't like us but just install the package yeah Google okay remove let's try this again here this is real-time coding tinkering whatever you want to call it it's very slow install I don't think it's the code code seems beating me it's so simple we will see them with the CPU it's not happy [Music] are you ready I think they're ready I think we're ready yay pretty cool so you can see here now we have the 10 best courses on coding uh we are getting the results Google is returning so this is super cool very simple package Google that you can build around but it makes it really fun that you can add it to an application think of getting this list or this result and being able to display it on your application or use it in varying ways okay the next thing we are going to do is convert an image into a PDF and this is something I feel like I always am finding the need for maybe a company is sending me what they think is a document and I need to sign it but it's in the format of jpeg or PNG and I'm like I need to just send me the PDF but for whatever reason it always seems to be an issue so what I built here or what we are going to build is a very simple script using image to PDF which is a package in Python that will allow you to convert images into PDFs let's get into it as you
