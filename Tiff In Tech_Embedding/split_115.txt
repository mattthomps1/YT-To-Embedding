was a manager and in this role I'm mostly an IC I oversee just one person um and so that's different than say overseeing a team of like 10 15. yeah so I think it's it's really that sweet spot of doing it right there I think I view it personally as my own Executive MBA so I never went to business school yes and that's a separate topic we don't need to go into that I have a lot of reasons for that but um but I view my chief of staff gig because often it's a two to three year job yes like there's a somewhat of an understanding that says you're going to do this role for two to three years and you'll move on and go back into the business be a manager do something like that so I view it as my equivalent of a paid MBA because you take a step back you re-evaluate what you want to do and in every strategic project I do I think do I want to work in marketing for example if I'm doing a marketing project do I want to work in Communications do I want to work in finance and so that's a little bit of the benefits of the role so in the sense of it is a lot of responsibility you're often encounter like I often encounter imposter syndrome in the sense of being the most Junior person in the room because it's very easy to say why am I here you know I only have you know five six years of experience but folks here have 20 why am I here um so so it is in that sense challenging but on the flip side you're in rooms that you would never be in yeah if you weren't in this role exactly and so yeah major Pros to the role I would say but also not cons but it's not an easy one yes in that sense yes exactl
