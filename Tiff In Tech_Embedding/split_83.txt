but it's something that is well recognized in   the industry now once again this is not a free 
certification so I would really recommend asking   your employer if they can help support funding

be almost looked at as a win-win they are funding   for more education and in turn you can apply 
that to the company this is a certification   for individuals who really want to expand their 
skills as project managers the certification shows   that an individual has the skills to Define

individual is around 150 000 U.S coming in at   number three is something for all my devops people 
which is Microsoft Azure devops engineer this is a   great certification it's been around for a while 
and they Continue to update it as the world of   devops evolves don't die it's gonna die again 
also it's important to know that this is a course   that you already have to have experience with 
developing an Azure and also to be familiar with   Azure devops and GitHub there are prerequisites of 
two other certifications before you get to this so   that's why it is relatively high up on this list 
is because it is very high paying and also too   very in demand for number two on the list is cism 
certified information security manager and this of   course is a really well paid certificati
