ideo around this topic leave it down in the comments I always answer every single one of your questions it might take a day or two but I will get to you okay let's jump into it for a bit more context around my experience with this I it was this past summer I decided to quit my software developer job and at the time I didn't have another one lined up why I did that there was a lot of things going on behind the scenes meaning there was a family member who was dealing with some health issues I knew I wanted to take the summer to just breathe and get more into developer relations which I'm at a job now in developer relations and I love it but the point being it was a risk that I took and while I say that I want to really highlight I wouldn't have been able or wouldn't have felt comfortable taking that risk or that leap if I didn't have a financial plan lined up and what I mean by this is I knew that for X number of months or time that I could still comfortably live my life because of how I had set things up prior so it wasn't as though it was an irresponsible decision by any needs okay feel like I needed to get that out of the way just to do that disclosure because I don't want to mislead anyone through these topics now a lot of you let me pull up the questions here because I did a asked in our community tab questions you have around this one question that I got asked and it got upvoted quite a bit is is a job in text still worth pursuing if I haven't finished my studies yet should I keep studying and my opinion in that is absolutely this too shall pass yes it's not the greates
