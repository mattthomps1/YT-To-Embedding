notice anything different anything that looks 
different on me today what about the Hat what do   we think of the Hat Tiff and Tack merch although

engineer and this is a role that there are   not enough people to fill spots for and it will 
continue to go this way as AI continues to blow   up now I get asked a lot around is AI just going

web3 is here to stay but more so is it just gonna   be this hype this rush and then it calms down I

GPT caught on with everyone that the user base   mods they can hear that
