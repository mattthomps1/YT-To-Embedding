 is the skills you're learning today a will very much so be applicable in the future because Tech really forces you to be a forever learner that you're constantly learning and growing so it's one of those things that yes still learn how to code knowing that it's just a forever learning process but it does get easier once you know the fundamentals okay another question is what advice could you give to someone who wants to be part of it but doesn't have a background instead specifically math that's a great question I think there's a stigma that you have to be a math expert to get into stem or coding in general and it's completely not true of course math is required depending on what way you specialize in or go in and and it's one of those things up for me anyways when I started my coding journey I really didn't know math like I was terrible at math but then as you learn to code and grow your technical skills skills your way of thinking changes and it's this whole new way of thinking and in turn I found myself slowly but surely becoming better at math or that way of thinking and it just organically happened so my advice to that is no matter where your skill set is at today don't base that on what you are or are not capable of you're continuing to grow continuing to learn and even if you're bad at math today in the future you might be really good at it or you might choose a role instead that doesn't require a lot of math which there's a ton of developers that don't use a lot of math there's a ton of roles that you don't need to do that so don't let that don't let that stop you
