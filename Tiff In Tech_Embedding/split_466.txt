from   company to company over time it will be required 
to pick up different programming languages and   when I was looking online and I spoke to I do a 
little poll actually texting some of my software   engineering friends who I've worked with in the 
past and said how many programming languages do   you know not tinkered around with but like 
actually no and on average it was around two   to three I would say closer to three for most and 
they are mainly individuals who are Midway through   their career so still have a lot of growth to do 
so maybe that will change as they grow but what   I find is that really depends on how you grow in 
your software engineering career which I mean you   can go senior engineer and continue to grow and 
be coding your entire career but more often than   not we see that software Engineers end up kind of 
evolving with their roles as their career grows as   well and I think that's why the number three is a 
good number for typically on average the number of   programming languages that a software engineer 
will know really in depth now as I mentioned   there's a ton of different uh caveats to this that 
you could include but but I would say on average   based on my research about three now I don't want 
that to stress you out though if you are starting   out in your career it doesn't mean that you have 
to know everything right away please do not take   this as that but it's more something I was just 
curious about how many programming languages do   most developers know actually on that note leave 
in the comments how many years you have
