 to have to install some modules and whatnot actually it sets that up here copy code and create a vs code project or a project in vs code so we can run this locally let's do it okay so now you can see we have vs code open and this is just an empty folder that I put into it so if we go into new terminal here make sure you're in the actual project python Voice Assistant actually I'll link this project in my GitHub down below as well so if you want to follow along that way all right next what we need to do is create our main file so let's just go main.py and there we go and now let's initiate a virtual environment what this will do is it will allow us to install different modules and packages and run all of those packages and modules just within this project so you can continue to build other projects outside of this and you'll have to re-install any packages you want to use again but this is a great way to kind of contain the invert the virtual environment I can't speak today and it's and I've already had like coffee maybe too much coffee is the issue all right first thing we are going to do is type in Python three because I'm using three and then we're going to do and what this will do is oh here we go we notice the environment has created you want to select it for work on that you can see here now it has created this new environment folder then let's go into this environment folder perfect and now you can see we are in the environment now we are able to install different packages so if we go back to chat GPT here where are you this is a problem with too many screens all rig
