will still be very important but it will evolve as well also too when I think of how AI will really change software and development one thing I think we don't speak about enough is how it will be used to our benefit to learn faster I use AI all the time to explain very technical topics to me in a simple way that I can understand when I make chat GPT or other tools of AI work for me and say you know explain it to me like a software engineer who's a child or whatever the case is depending on what I'm learning it really helps me understand these technical Concepts that probably would have taken me a long time to understand otherwise which is very interesting and kind of uncomfortable to be honest with you because you think well are we going to lose that thought process then that gets us to learning these technical things is at all a benefit that is something I think we will see come out with data over the years but I'm not saying this should be your sole way of learning moving forward but it's a great tool to really help you learn quickly and also build quickly I know for me another area that with software development the use of AI has really come into play is creativity I feel like to make say games with python and Pie game or different tools like that used to take so long that I would rarely do it because it would be like okay it's going to take me quite a few hours I know I'll introduce bugs and it'll be a whole thing now with say chat gbt I recently just coded the game pong and I input what I wanted chat GPT to build for me I put it into Rebel and or you could do vs code w
