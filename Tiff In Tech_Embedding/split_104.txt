 inspiration for sharing my journey is is giving advice to my younger self or my younger sisters because when I was navigating it I had no Role Models or people that I could look up to and say what is a career in Tech look like I didn't even know Tech existed as a field right for me growing up in a brown immigrant family it was you're either going to be a doctor you're going to be a lawyer or you're going to be an engineer and there's no other career path available right yeah that's it so for the longest time I was pre-med I actually studied Neuroscience in University which is nothing to do with my day-to-day um but it wasn't until I got to college where I realized the vast careers that exist that are outside those three fields and I would have never been exposed to those had I not gone to University and you know had a good guidance counselor or had these things but it's unfair that that is what led me to this path and I didn't have the resources that exist for others who maybe have parents or siblings or just a network outside of that so my career Journey starts I guess in college really where I was pre-med and just didn't enjoy that path I think I enjoyed studying science because I've always been good at science and Neuroscience particularly is really interesting um it's super interesting and it connects to business like when you think later down the line about decision making and purchase power it's all related to science right but at the time I was like I don't want to be in a lab I don't really want to do the research so I um stumbled upon an internship at JP Morgan at
