ty is as everything is automated and 
technology is intertwined further in these   cities data analysts or companies have the ability 
to frankly track what's going on where humans are   going what are they doing what decisions are they 
making now that on its own is a whole other topic   we are not going to get into in this video but the 
reality is just like companies have data analysts   to analyze how people are using their products 
or their apps and what data they can gather there   is the possibility of data analysts specific for 
smart cities this is a really interesting job if   you ask me or could be an interesting job merging 
both city planners Architects but then also to   technologists actually let me pause in some of 
these updates here I really want to highlight   one thing we are talking about jobs of the future 
and for the most part they all are really closely   intertwined with tech do you notice a trend 
here although there are a lot of conversations   happening online right now around how Tech is 
going to become obsolete or Tech workers are going   to become obsolete or or should you even learn 
how to code more everything I just listed I think   well maybe not space tour guide but for the most 
part everything I've listed you need to be pretty   technical or understanding of tech or passionate 
or or be involved in Tech to some degree and I   think that will become closer and closer or 
closely knit together as technology continues   to evolve in our daily lives the need for people 
who understand technology understand code even if   they're not code
