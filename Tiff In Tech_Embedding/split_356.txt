to varying degrees but you're quoting knowledge   in this role and one of the things though that 
I was nervous about getting into this role is   am I going to lose my technical skills and I 
think that's a huge fear that a lot of people   have if they're considering going into this role 
for me it wasn't a long-lived it was a short-lived   fear I guess you could say mainly because I have 
Tiffin Tech where I do different code with me's   I build cool things cool technology cool coding 
projects with you so I knew it wasn't something   that I would lose but rather just find other ways 
to do it and to me that was really exciting so   I absolutely love what I do it is a combination 
of as I mentioned those three pillars so working   directly with the community if people who are 
using your product have questions like developers   have questions around it also to sharing and 
educating about our tool that we make and how it   can be integrated into other projects the really 
good thing the company I work for is called stack   bit and the really good thing about it is it works 
with many many different Frameworks so it's not as   though I am honed in on one specific technology 
it can allow for many different Technologies to   work with which I really love and get excited 
about because then you're speaking to people who   are using many different Technologies as well 
and I think my favorite part of this role is   getting to flex men wear many hats Flex different 
skill sets and one of the challenging things I   would say about this role is around Community 
you're working
