if you are just starting out in your coding career   or coding journey is to pick up JavaScript this 
is the first language that I picked up and I would   still really recommend it today mainly because 
once again similar to python is very flexible   and can be used for a lot of different things so 
whether you are building on the front-end side of   things or maybe you're building on the back end 
it is one of those things that you can start your   coding Journey without having to fully commit as 
to what role you want and another thing on that   note is you can progress in your career maybe you 
start out in one area with this language and you   can grow into a different role that uses it for 
other things there's it's multi-purpose I guess   you could say so at this point python JavaScript 
maybe it's another language I didn't list here   I would focus on though taking a tutorial going 
the old-fashioned way if you will versus learning   directly with chat GPT at this point instead of 
just focusing on chat gbt for your beginning of   Learning I would focus on taking a tutorial 
now this is where chat gbt though can come in   handy still around asking you questions about 
the fundamentals and understanding if there's   you're taking a tutorial and there's an area 
that you still don't really understand you can   ask it to explain it to you let me show you 
and on that note when you are starting out   and wanting it to explain things to you it can 
be kind of generic let me show you what I mean   all right so in chat GPT now once again I'm so 
lucky I got in because
