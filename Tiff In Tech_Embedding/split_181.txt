e   starting with the basics you are just learning 
you are using chat GPT to learn let's see all   right so it's writing a script for us while 
it's generating let me have my coffee again okay so what it did was generate a script or 
import pandas Library which is extremely popular   and it's actually a really great thing though if 
you are learning python for example or JavaScript   or whatever the cases you are learning I'm just 
using python in this example because we've been   doing a lot with python lately and pandas is 
a library that is extremely popular for data   manipulation and a data manipulation library 
in Python and it explains to us what is going   on throughout this code so what is the benefit 
here well if you were taking a tutorial I know   I I'll list some tutorials here or whatever the 
noise is I don't know if I should use at sound   effect or not but here are some good tutorials 
to take and then as you're going through one of   the biggest things that I really struggled with 
was the instructor maybe didn't fully explain   something or I was kind of like a little lost and 
then I'd asked the question say I was taking a   udemy course I would ask the question in the chat 
and it would take days for that person to respond   and I paid money for this do you know what I mean 
whereas this is if you're taking a course whether   it be one of the courses I shared with you or 
or not you can actually just ask it to explain   to you what exactly it is or start from start 
from the basics another way is to get it to quiz   you actually get it to create a quiz
