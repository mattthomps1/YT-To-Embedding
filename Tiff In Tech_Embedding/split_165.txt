this in this example because it's not like you   have to pay a fee or anything to use it it's just 
a free fun API okay so let's grab our API key okay   one thing too before we go back into our code we

to convert to us so let's copy this as well copy   go back into our code there we go and then we can 
make an environment file for this or you can just   input it well you should make it an Artful file
