s well and you're probably wondering well I understand I can visually picture what it would look like for a Capstone project for iOS or Android but what about for a database engineer so for this Capstone project it's a really great idea what they do is you'll demonstrate your new skill set by designing and composing a database solution so this is something that I really think especially with this course will really help you stand out because I just I've never seen courses like this before especially for database engineers and I think this is a really great way to go then of course there is as I mentioned the coding interview preparation finally for all of these courses I listed once you complete one of them or all of them depending on your level of eagerness you will get access to the meta career programs job board so what this means is it's essentially I think it's around 200 employers that have committed to sourcing Talent through meta certificate program so they are looking for specifically people who have completed these programs which is I mean it's a win-win I don't know what what more you would need as far as a straight path into meta and it's a great way to network with employers they want you to succeed and they want to hire you so this is something you will get once you have completed a course and okay the next question is well how long am I going to have to dedicate to this well for example if you were to do approximately seven hours a week which is an hour a day which really is nothing the program will take approximately eight months to complete and that varies
