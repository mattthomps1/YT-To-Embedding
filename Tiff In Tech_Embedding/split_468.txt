want to learn how to code here are the top things I would do differently if I was to relearn coding all over again because a lot of the times the fundamental principles can be applied to many programming languages the first thing I would do is focus on the fundamentals why because a lot of the times the fundamentals can be transferred to learning other programming languages invest more time at the beginning and it can help you in the long run next up I would get a mentor way sooner the journey in learning to code can be really intense and having someone there to support you and answer questions along the way will really help lead you to success and the most important thing I would do is give myself more time now let me explain what exactly I mean by this this is actually where I see most people fail when entering the world of coding you quickly realize there is a lot to learn and it feels like you will never learn it all stop cramming everything in take it day by day know it is a forever learning process you will get there over time
