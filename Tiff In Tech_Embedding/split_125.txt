yeah if you know me by now you know I love to automate pretty much anything in my life that I can and I love to use Python A lot of times to do it some of you've been asking for JavaScript tutorials which will be coming soon as well but today we are going to be essentially automating our life wait let me rephrase that not just automating our life but creating for ourselves our own little assistant essentially with the use of python and getting chat GPT to help I wanted to include chat GPT in this tutorial going through automating with python and creating a voice assistant for us because the reality is chat GPT is a tool that developers will continue to use in their day-to-day lives or very frequently and rather than pushing it to the side but as it continues to get smarter and data gets updated we need to embrace it and start using it okay I kind of gave it away what we're building today but we are building a virtual assistant so we will be using python chat GPT to use a virtual assistant that we can actually give voice commands to it will respond to and track what kind of tasks we are giving so it's two-way interactive voice assistant that's virtual that will be running in the background and can listen for a certain commands this is super cool and I was blown away how easy it is to make this voice assistant let's get into it foreign here I have chat GPT and we're going to give it a command that will build a python project for us that will create a voice assistant so we are able to speak to our computer and it is listening and then it will reply so this could be to-do list
