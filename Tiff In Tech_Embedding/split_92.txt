nd these roles honestly   if you would have told me a few years about them 
I would have thought you're crazy there's no way   these are going to be a thing and now living in 
today I'm like of course A lot of these make a   lot of sense so I'm curious to hear what do you 
think are some jobs of the future what are some   skills you will need for these jobs data seems to 
be a big Trend cyber security there's different   Trends in each of these jobs that are still coming 
through the reality is though once again if you're   just starting out and I want to know where to to 
begin I would just start out immersing yourself   in technology whether it be in a specific area or 
maybe you don't know a specific area of Interest   yet I would just start out learning some code 
or speaking to people in the industry anyways   leave down below other jobs you think will be 
coming out of tech in the next few years and   that was very slow editor can you speed 
that up I'll see you all soon bye everyone
