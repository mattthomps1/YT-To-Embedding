ays all of that's really interesting to me just as a curiosity Point not really from a tactical perspective but I was already a business minor even my first year because I thought I was going to open a clinic or I thought I wanted to be as I said a doctor and I said if I'm going to be a doctor I could work in a clinic business is helpful right um and so when I was taking my business classes I think business majors get a bit of a bad rep sometimes because uh people think it's an easy major it's a little bit of a you know an easy time but I do think that if you have the ability to study business the practical skills that you gain you know I took a class on resume writing I took a class on interviews I took a class on communication these are skills that I use to this day you know and are so transferable and so transferable um I like the combination of my Majors because I felt like my Neuroscience major thought taught me to think deeply about the world and think more um philosophically whereas my business major was very tactical yeah like I learned um I learned skills that were very much like Excel but again I didn't do those until my Junior and Senior year yes so by that time I already had my internship so the other thing is if it does not matter what you study in University yes yeah in Tech today I knew people who are philosophy Majors Neuroscience Majors Communications Majors that do anything and I know your path you know you you study fashion and then and then you worked in you know Tech and encoding right so exactly I think it's really up there you can do whatever you want
