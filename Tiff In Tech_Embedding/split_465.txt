ay of doing this 
video which I you know I love okay so as I just   said one programming language to start with now 
as you grow in your career does that change or   can you just focus on one programming language 
and the quick answer is yes you can focus on   just one programming language and really dive 
deep into that for example I had a co-worker who   they had been programming for 10 
plus no not 10 that would make sense   they're all going for a very long time all 
they focused on was JavaScript and react so   and it was right when react came out how many 
years was that when react came out but anyways   right when it came out till now they went hard on 
react they love react you can ask them anything   about it and they will know and that's kind of 
them going really deep into one they have zero   interest in taking a job or a project though that 
would require learning a different uh framework   or programming language so that's definitely one 
way to go really deep into one there can be some   downsides to that such as if you're not willing 
to even be flexible or consider you know you   might be missing out on some opportunities but on 
the other hand some companies might really really   want someone who's a very deep specialist in that 
so it's not a negative or positive I think it's   just a preference thing for me anyways I never 
went that way because I'm way too curious I love   exploring different languages and Frameworks 
the other way to go though is more like what   I did where you were growing in your software 
engineering career and naturally as you go
