is my journey this might not work for you this is not advice here but this worked for me so maybe it helps right um and so just reframing it as you're not and you're not an advisor but you're more so a Storyteller yes exact sense exactly um I feel like I could sit here and pick your brain forever and this is why I said to you I need to do I literally am planning to come back to New York and just have like a weekend of just like full like just like connecting over coffee and whatnot um but to end to kind of wrap up our conversation something that I always ask everyone and um is is really around what advice would and you shared so much amazing advice that I'm just like I could just listen and listen to this but what advice would you give to your younger self um that's that's interesting I think I would tell my younger self on the very beginning I would just tell her to relax yeah like things will work out I think I was very very high strung as uh as in high school and in Early College um I think some of that comes with just being the oldest child and sometimes the oldest child of an immigrant family yeah it was very much even more even more so that pressure was on because there was a pressure of figuring things out but also doing things in the right way and balancing your identity with your Ambitions which I still navigate you know as you know personally I've I got married young I got married at 23. um and uh that's not like my co-workers in Investment Banking were like what is going you know yeah yeah you know things like that um and so balancing like a lot of those elements
