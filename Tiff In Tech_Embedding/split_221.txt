xpected we need to set up a twilio account let's go ahead and do that and it also didn't create a job for us so you can see here you can schedule the script to run using a task scheduler which we will get it to create a job for us as well but let's first do twilio and go here to twilio and create a free account I forget if I have one I think I have one give me a sec here if you already have one login if you don't create one okay so I got my twilio account set up which I'm not going to share with you at this time but just make sure you are logged into a twilio account and also to create a new project with BS code create a new file in that project I just did main.pi now first things first let's get our python virtual environment setup I always forget this I don't know why I think because I'm a JavaScript person at heart so let me scroll here and I have Visual Studio code I'll link these docs down below because they're so helpful no matter what stage you're at with python and you can actually just go to well I'll just link it down below but basically it shares to you how to create a virtual environment in the terminal so I'm on Mac so I can just simply copy this and this is obviously assuming you follow the steps prior so you have python installed on your computer now let's go back to there and there we go perfect the back what's next and I think we can just start installing after this installing projects that's why we need to create a virtual environment is I need to be able to install some of these packages that chat GPT was telling us to install so if I go back to chat GPT
