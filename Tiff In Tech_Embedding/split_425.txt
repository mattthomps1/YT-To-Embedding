out of it that they're not rescinding their offer because of who I am they wanted to hire me it's just because of if anything it shows more about that company unfortunately that you know there's a lot going on right now they just can't the budget doesn't allow for it so it's nothing to be really personal I know that's not a perfect answer and it just sucks at the end of the day but I really wanted to that's how I would navigate it so to sum it up yes getting a job in Tech I think is still very exciting and I think there is so much opportunity and once again going back to what I first said this too shall pass it's just kind of this wave we are in but don't let that stop you from going after what you really want you're passion about or you enjoy doing and if that is something that you are studying in Tech keep on doing it because there is still so so many opportunities out there I know for myself when I was looking for a job this past summer it was it felt like there was just so many opportunities and granted I am not someone who is just starting out in the industry so I know it's completely different but I'm telling you this to hopefully share with you that it's not as though there is no one hiring or anything like that and there is opportunity still there I think the most important thing is keeping your networking going keeping your options open and uh keeping your skills strong I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this though and I hope my perspective will help you kind of move forward I know it can be a scary time for many but we got this we have an amazing Community actu
