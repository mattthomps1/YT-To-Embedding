been using swim
and essentially swim is a Dev tool that reinvented the way developers manage knowledge about
code what do I mean with that well here are three points that really help me understand
swim one is it's easy to find so if you've ever used any documentation working for a
company before or writing your own documentation a lot of times it can get messy really quickly
and difficult to find think of when you're onboarding at a new company how difficult
it can be another thing about it is it's always up to date developers don't need to worry
about is my documentation up today documentation should be something that is almost like a
third arm if that makes sense meaning it just functions it's just part of what we do versus
it's this thing that we have to struggle with all the time okay so you can see on screen
here I have swim I did add a repository uh as I was working around with it and we are
going to add a new repository for this video so I'm going to exit out a swim for now we'll
get back into it and let's create a react app okay so let's just start right from the
beginning that's what I feel like a lot of tutorials typically Miss is okay where are
we gonna go inside let's go inside documents and now we just create our typical react app
MPX right my keyboards over here if it looks weird this is the problem with working with
monitors well not really supposed to solve that problem but create react app and let's
call this let's call this react search app all right and now we wait it's time to go
get a coffee okay now that we have our project up and well
not running yet
