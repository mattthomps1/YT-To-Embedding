anage everything 
um and saying no to things that are not a priority   um and being able to balance not only work and 
social media but also going to social events   and things that just like make yourself happy 
exactly keeping you know that connection close   with friends and families family and prioritizing 
that as well and do you find uh that having all   these different uh interests and passions that you 
do that they they uh I don't know how to return   but they bleed into one another meaning like a 
lot of your experience from modeling in some ways   helps you as a better data scientist even or like 
just different facets kind of connect each other   um I think in the interview process because 
um Etsy is my first full-time job when they   were asking me questions about prior experience I 
did tell them that I I modeled and different soft   skills that were applicable to um to this job 
now so that's how they kind of like bleed into   each other but besides that um no they're like all 
pretty separate except like in being in Tech and   being a social media content creator yeah um so 
that kind of leads into each other I'm sure though   even with uh Miss New York USA when when young 
girls are looking up to you and then you know   looking up to you and then they see oh wow she's 
a data scientist I'm sure through that as well   you're even maybe on knowing inspiring millions 
of young girls around when they're watching   like wow she can do that I can do that too you 
know yeah I that's why I love pageantry because   as a model it's honestly a lot about your looks
