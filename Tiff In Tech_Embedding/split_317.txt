cience uh I know you do   a lot outside of data science as well which we'll 
get to later because I think it's super important   to to cover those aspects as well but uh what is a 
day in the life like for a data science scientist   so at Etsy um a data scientist means a lot of 
different things so not only are you a coder   but you're also a problem solver a statistician 
and a domain expert so on my day-to-day like   the first couple of days of the week so Monday to 
Wednesday I'll be in a lot of meetings a big part   of being a data scientist is communicating with 
stakeholders and presenting your analyzes um and   storytelling with data so that's the first half of 
my week and then Thursday and Friday I'm more like   Focus days focused time to just heads down time 
to code and that includes like building tables   um with the logic our business logic and 
embedded into them also creating dashboards   based off of those tables and also experiment 
analysis which is the fun part of the job   experiment analysis yeah so I actually got 
into data science because I was fascinated   by experimentation and iterating 
on a product to make it better so   um we I have a couple of experiments going on 
right now and usually how that works is first   the ideation process with your product manager 
I'm working and as a data scientist you work with   different people on the team such as a product 
manager a product designer and Engineers okay   um so yeah first is the ideation process with my 
product Squad and then we go into launching the   experiment and we have an experimentation
