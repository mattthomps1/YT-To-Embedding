ou down here the Y goes back to 
for me what I do is I actually put on my phone   I have where's my phones over there I have a 
vision board where it's actually what I want   my life to look like and in order to get that 
life I'm not talking necessarily materialistic   maybe it's through different experiences or things 
that come up but in order to achieve that this is   the steps I need to take and having that on my 
phone every single day seeing every single day   really motivates me for my why and some days 
as I mentioned I might not even be motivated   it might be disciplined but you need to have that 
why really strong I've actually been thinking of   putting something like a vision board or something 
I know it sounds kind of cheesy but it's so true   having this why will keep you motivated forward 
and that is the biggest takeaway I hope you take   from this video is understand your why and not 
only have a direct why maybe not I want to get   a promotion or I want to get a raise or whatever 
the case may be but think about how that will   affect your life long term and when you start 
really painting a picture and the story of how   this will affect your life whoa this could you 
know spending a few extra hours each week will   have a huge huge impact on my life when I look 
ahead and that makes it more impactful and more   meaningful okay I really hope this has given you 
some inspiration or motivation around when you are   working in a full-time job studying full-time 
and you have things you want to learn on top   of that it is possible do not burn out do not
