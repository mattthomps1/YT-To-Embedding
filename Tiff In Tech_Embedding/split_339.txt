rrors if there's inconsistency this one is game changer I told you I'm gonna say it for all of them this tool is really cool and something I wish I knew about earlier now this tool before we even get into it it's called Loop CV and you do have to be careful with this because what it essentially does is you upload your CV select a job type you want and press start then Loop will really do the rest meaning it will mass apply on your behalf every single day so there's pros and cons to this the con is what the pro is which is it's Mass applying the con on this side though is that you could be it could be applying to jobs that you really want for you and for those jobs you might want to tailor specifically your resume and CV so that's the downside the major downside the upside is if you're in a position where you've been applying for quite a while and you're just not getting anything you're tired this is a great tool to help you just like blast out your resume and CV so I'll share it on screen here let me just record my screen the first thing you can do is put in the job title job location and for me I like to search just for remote jobs I like the comfort of my home and uh then put in your CV or resume now if we go next how you want to present yourself so for example present yourself Tiffany interested to learn more I'd probably change this but let's just leave this as is for now okay so you can see how it works save Harry Mr mugs actually don't include my email one second here save and then just cut this part out if I don't want to put anyone next and then it goes into do you
