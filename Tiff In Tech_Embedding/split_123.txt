n that I talked about was redirection so like I was meant to be in this city for that reason and I love the city now and things like that in my career has would not have been the same if I'd stayed in California so uh and neither would be my personal life so I think that the first thing I tell myself is to relax and take things step by step yeah like don't don't over plan the future which we talked about at the beginning and then the second thing I would tell myself is [Music] um is you have more ability than you give yourself credit for uh I think a lot of us are our own worst critics like we tend to um not see our potential the most sometimes or at least I do yeah I uh I think we're our own harshest critics right and as cheesy as it sounds you know sometimes people will come to me my friends will come to me and tell me about a problem and I will hype them up to the extent right I'm like yeah Tiff you got this you are so calm like you're so competent don't worry about it you got this but then how I speak to myself in not that way I'm always like girl you're gonna struggle like you don't have it you're not it right um and I think why why am I so compassionate towards my friends and my family and to myself I'm so critical and I'm so um sometimes unappreciative and so I think I would just tell myself to be kinder and realize that the ability is there and sometimes you are your own worst critic I love that be kinder to yourself speak to yourself the way you speak to others exactly to your best friend like speak to yourself like you would to your best friend your partner whatev
