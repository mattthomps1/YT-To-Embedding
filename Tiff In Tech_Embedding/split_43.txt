okay I'm gonna explain to you what a proxy is because it is a tech term that took me way long to understand way too long to understand I'd be in business meetings I would be uh starting out as a developer and people would keep on being like Oh it's a proxy it's a proxy like what is a proxy example actually so think of it as you want to send a message to your friend but you don't want them to know it's coming through you so you use another friend to send that message and that friend is kind of what a proxy is like it sits between your computer and the internet and it allows you to access websites or services without having to uh expose your true identity so when a user types in a website before it gets to the website the proxy can do something so for example a lot of schools can use proxies when they want to block or restrict access to say social media sites so the user the students on the computer they type in the social media site and then from there the proxy interjects and decides what to do with it
