how many programming languages do you need to 
know in order to be considered a successful   software engineer well let me reverse that 
a little bit how many programming languages   do you need to know to be successful in 
your software engineering career today   I'm going to share with you my thoughts on 
how many you should learn to start with and   how many most programmers end up learning 
in their career before we get to it though   you know the drill we need to collect coffee 
let's go come on okay wait wait wait wait wait   before I head out actually we need to talk 
about the interact conference it is a free   virtual conference that I will be attending 
and I want to see you there I attended the   last conference and one of the best things about 
it is you get to learn from the top engineering   leaders and what I really found helpful is it was 
kind of like a day full of mentorship and guidance   from some of these incredible leaders that you 
wouldn't get to typically hear speak otherwise   especially all packed into one day also there are 
two tracks that you can focus on at the conference   one is Dev interrupted where you will listen to 
stories of failure Redemption panels featuring   the biggest names in engineering leadership this 
track has insights processes and really lots of   know-hows on how to turn Engineers into leaders 
and companies into unicorns then the second track   or the other track is linear Beyond learn about 
tactical practices insights and success stories   that Linear B customers have used to transform 
their their value delivery pipel
