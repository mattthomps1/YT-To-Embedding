ever have a day start where you thought you're 
gonna be so productive and you think it's gonna   look like this only in reality to have it 
more end up like this the good news is you   are definitely not alone and the even better 
news is there are ways that you can combat this   to really actually having that productive day 
that you're looking for that's that yeah okay Carol dweck is a famous American psychologist 
who focuses on just this around growth and fixed   mindset actually in the 1970s she conducted 
a series of experiments on children and their   responses to challenges she found that some 
children were more likely to embrace challenges   and view failure is an opportunity to learn 
while other children were more likely to give   up easily and view failure is a reflection of 
their own abilities so how does this happen at   such a young age how are some children already 
viewing failure as a way to grow While others   are viewing it as they're stuck they're in this 
place well she labeled these two mindsets which   I'm sure a lot of us are now familiar with which 
is fixed mindset and growth mindset now the good   news is through her studies and research over the 
years she actually found that the way your mindset   Works your fixed mindset can be changed with 
certain interventions and that's what we're going   to cover today ways that you can actually build 
habits to keep you motivated and focused because   a lot of times we like to sum it up as oh it 
must be just the work isn't that interesting but   usually there's a lot more going on related 
to it okay
