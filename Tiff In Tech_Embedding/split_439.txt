s a lot to learn   there are so many resources out there so much out 
there and it's overwhelming for me I remember I   would start learning you know react and then view 
came out and I was like or it was the hot thing   at the time it's like oh my gosh I need a switch

you are first of all learning enough it's just you   need to take it day by day and I think one of 
the most important things is whatever you pick   just stick to it until you feel pretty proficient 
in it it's easy to jump around and then in turn   not really learn anything okay another reason why 
coding can be really difficult to learn is coding   is hard to teach and a lot of times you will be 
taking coding tutorials and maybe you really look   up to these people but they're not teaching it 
in the best way possible let me rewind that a bit   maybe they're teaching it in the best way possible
