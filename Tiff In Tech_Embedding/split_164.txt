 because if you remember here 
default icon is icon.png and then we have as well   default index default pop-up which is index HTML 
which is coming from here so it's very important   to make sure that you have those things outlined 
properly next up let's go to API ninjas and this   is where I am getting this API from now I'm 
actually here we go okay so for this API as   I mentioned it is for the currency exchange so 
if you go down to exchange rate there is a one   hour delay in fetching the latest exchange rates 
which I'm fine with if you I was using this in an   application where others were using it maybe 
um for I mean but the exchange rate doesn't   change that much typically famous last words 
in an hour so I'm fine with it uh so yeah API   ninjas it's free to sign up and I really love 
they have a ton of different apis which makes   me get really creative and this isn't sponsored 
by them or anything I just discovered them and   love them so yeah I went to exchange rate and 
then if you scroll down you can see here they   have code examples so we used something similar 
for JavaScript well we used fetch but similar   concept anyway so now we need to grab our API key 
so I'm going to go ahead and log in and after I   log in I will take you along with me as to where 
to get the API key from okay now that I've logged   into forgot my passwords how to reset that uh now 
that I've logged into API ninjas you can see here   I just went to my account and then right here is 
where you will be able to find your API key I'm   obviously not going to share it with you but thi
