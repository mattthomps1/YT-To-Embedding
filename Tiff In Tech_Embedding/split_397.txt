g uh like I've tried going into   a few schools I ended up getting into um pretty 
awesome School in Israel um I'm not gonna name   it because no one cares but I went there and I 
was one of the few designers that I that I know   that from the very beginning was very targeted on 
I'm gonna design for Tech okay like I want to see   myself in a tech company I was curious about 
what that means and and I feel like from very   um early like this was 2000 I started 
school back like 2009 eight I think nine   um this was pretty rare for folks to like none 
of my professors came from that background   right like no one no one really they all 
came from like old school graphic design   um backgrounds um illustrators uh typographers 
Etc and suddenly like they're hearing that there's   like this shift in the industry and learning 
uh about all these like different roles that   um you can focus on so yeah that was kind of like 
what I did and I think like being super focused   on that from the very beginning kind of gave me 
an edge and I feel like back in the back then   I could have pointed at any startup and tell them 
hey uh oh for sure I can work here and they would   be like all right how much yeah so it was I was I 
felt very privileged to take that path although I   remember one of my very early mentors before I 
even got to school was like we were doing like   this school prep to get into art school and 
I remember the first thing they this guy told   us when he entered the room was if anyone here 
is trying to actually make a career they will   be profitable please step out
