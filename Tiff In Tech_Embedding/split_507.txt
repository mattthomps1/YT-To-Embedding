al compensation I definitely suggest you check out levels FYI you've probably heard me mention this quite a few times and it's because I absolutely love the resource mainly because they break down total compensation by location by company and by years of experience and by different roles so you can get really exact as to what you should expect all right let's jump into base salary base salary is a fixed amount of salary that you get for showing up at work well maybe you have to do a little bit more than just show up but it's something that is consistent that you get you know you are starting with when you are hired you know the exact amount and it's something that doesn't change now when I say it doesn't change of course as you grow with the company and in your role or to a new role your base salary typically will go up and it's also important to note that base salary isn't affected by how well the company is doing if a company is doing really well your base salary typically doesn't go up and if they start not doing so well it's not going to go down also something that's really important to note here is you will never become rich and I use that in quotations because it depends on your definition of rich but you will never become rich I guess you could say off of base salary typically you know you're not going to typically people don't make a seven figure base salary I'm not saying it's impossible of course there are companies where the c-level people will make that but on average don't count on your base salary for what makes you Rich it's gonna it can pay a lot high high s
