 where you 
can start in on and just start building with those   okay let's take this off for a little bit 
next on the list is Swift Swift has continued   to gain popularity as iOS becomes more and 
more popular people want more apps people   want more games it's not going anywhere it is 
a programming language that ensures you have   a long a really stable career as apps and iOS 
development isn't going anywhere if you look at   the numbers it's continuing to go up and more and 
more in demand and honestly I have just tinkered   around with swift but it is so much fun it took 
me a minute to wrap my head around but I really   actually love xcode I know maybe that's because 
I'm not a professional iOS Developer I feel like   iOS developers always say the opposite but just 
the visual aspect of it is really exciting to   me okay course time which iOS course do you take 
you know this wouldn't be a proper list without   including a Dr Angela course she is OG is that 
what you can say original aishi is just I love   love love her courses I've taken some of her 
python courses and she's just incredible she's   brilliant in my opinion okay Angela if you're 
watching this you probably aren't but if you ever   do watch this I love you you're amazing you've 
really helped me in my coding career this is a   great iOS and Swift course uh you will learn to 
create a portfolio of 15 different apps to be   able to go from Junior developer to senior and 
I love that this really enables you to build so   many interesting projects that you can speak 
about here's a little side tip after y
