ld highly highly   recommend that you get a referral from someone you 
know that works in a company that will connect you   because it will just make everyone's life easier 
yeah and we'll probably help you shine faster but   let's say middle recruiter I think you first 
do man and seriously this is probably outdated   you will do a chat with a recruiter see that 
you're like a real human being yeah and your   qualifications seem reasonably like a good video 
yes um then you will probably do um a phone chat   with or like a like a virtual interview with one 
of the designers on like a a senior-ish designer   um on the team um again different companies do 
different uh things like it lift we would search   for dedicated um roles okay so the the whole like 
role management was around like who is the hiring   manager so the hiring manager will probably do a 
first interview with with the candidate and then   um after like there's like a portfolio review with 
like the recruiters and the hiring manager right   there that's the first filter and then you'll get 
to just have a quick chat with the hiring manager   see that you're like interest interesting person 
maybe review one or two um projects then you will   do sometimes you'll do an assignment okay yeah 
like hey if you choose a company now make it   better yeah right like those are the worst in my 
opinion they can be I like them really like I like   I I really like that part it's like a puzzle right 
it's like also it's like an opportunity to show   off true it's an opportunity to do some builds and 
whistles like it but
