up all day like all night from all   this coffee and drinking today I'm telling you see here this cone defines a function called

this whole whole thing too I'm going to put you   to sleep here you can pause this if you want to 
read it more but it is really breaking it down   and it's one of those things that if you don't 
understand a specific part of the explanation   you can even copy it and say explain this to 
me further and it's just so powerful I'm kind   of I I'm really mind blown I know I shouldn't be 
because I work intact but it's moving fast but I   wouldn't be doing this video Justice if I didn't 
really explain to you what not to use chat GPT for   because that is almost more important than what 
to use it for when learning also look at this View you might be saying well tip why not this 
seems perfectly fine this is what it's there   for and while I kind of agree with you to certain 
points you have to be aware especially when you   are learning to code that you need to know what 
is going on with the code if you were literally   just telling chat GPT or any AI service to just 
code for you a it's not going to scale that well   if at all actually B you're not going to know 
what it's doing and in turn you're going to   spend so much time debugging and working through 
errors that you're going to spend your time on   that which is a good way to learn as well versus
