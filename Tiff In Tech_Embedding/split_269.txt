more often than not through just engaging in these conversations with your friends to be like oh my you know my cousin of a cousin or whatever the case is they work in Tech why don't you connect with them so start really thinking about your network and utilizing it because if you are just sitting there and applying for jobs without reaching out to others it's going to be a longer haul typically in finding your job versus if you're actually using your connections or potential connections the last one on the list is trying to memorize and have everything perfect for your first phone call and this often times I see happen that we take advice too far where we you know so be prepared practice your answers okay yes have answers prepared be you know on top of your game but you don't want to become to the point where you're in the initial screening call and you sound like a robot you're just listing off your answers and it's obvious that you are just memorized answers and are just saying them and I think part of the thing is even if you aren't applying for a technical role people hire people they don't just hire skills and you can push back and say this isn't true and maybe in some instances it isn't the full truth but people on average want good people to work for them to work with good people and if that means hiring someone who's very authentic and real has a great personality and is a team player more likely than not companies will hire that person over someone who might be more a bit more qualified skillfully but has no sign of wanting to work together in teams or be friendly
