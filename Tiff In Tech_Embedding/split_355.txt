ssing my career in that 
way and I just wasn't feeling fulfilled I felt   like there was so much more I could offer into 
what my skill sets were and that's not to say   you can't have an amazing career being a software 
developer and growing it that way it just I knew I   wanted to really find the mix between soft skills 
and technical skills now to get into developer   relations and developer advocacy what skills do 
you need this is a question I get asked a lot   if you don't have developer experience can you 
become one and I think yes you could definitely   become a developer Advocate without the technical 
experience but it'd be very difficult meaning you   are speaking to developers you're often building 
tutorials for developers showing code on screen   solving their technical problems no you have 
to you have to be a developer before I think   at least to some degree or at least have very 
strong skills to develop maybe you only were   a developer for a year or two years but you need 
something there and that goes to the next question   is well do you code in this role and once again 
that can vary company to company some developer   Advocates as I mentioned they code all the time 
others don't and for me I when I'm how I like to   look at it is you aren't building for production 
you're building for other developers so this might   be through doing demos getting on webinars with 
other developer Advocates and building a project   with them making video tutorials answering 
questions in Discord different things like   that so you get to still flex your coding skill
