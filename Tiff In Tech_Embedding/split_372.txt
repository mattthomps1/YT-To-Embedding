nd Java 17. this course 
I loved because it was recently updated actually   in 10 October of this year which is huge and they 
always release quite frequent updates as well so   why do I love this course in particular one of the 
things that initially drew me to this course is I   always look at the instructors credentials who 
are they where do they come from what is their   background and for me I love that it is actually 
taught by a professional Java developer who who   hasn't just been in the industry for a few years 
but has worked with the language for over 18 years   so not only do they know the positives of Jabba 
but they also know the downsides the pitfalls and   I think that is almost more important because 
then they know how to teach in a way that they   will know what you will come across the problems 
you will face potentially with that language also   too in this course it has 52 coding exercises 
I don't typically see courses having this many   exercises exercises are a great way when you are 
taking a course that is a little bit lengthier   that it breaks it up in a way to actually test 
your learning because sometimes okay maybe it's   just me but sometimes I kind of get dozy when I 
start watching courses and I have to rewind and   figure out where I was so having exercises within 
them is a great way to stay on top of things   next up is next on the list my personal favorite 
maybe Lee because this was the programming   language I learned on which is Javascript love 
it or hate it JavaScript made it on this list   and it's here to stay for the time bei
