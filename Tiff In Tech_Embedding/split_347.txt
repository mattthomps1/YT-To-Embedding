any studies around this that to work   or study at your optimal time and there's also a 
lot of studies that showed to study right before   actually or learn something new before you go to 
sleep for me though even with all that data I know   what works best for me is to do it in the morning 
and I really wanted to highlight that because some   days you're not going to be able to do it all and 
that is okay some days you might have a very some   weeks you might have a very long week at work 
or at school and you're like I'm getting so far   behind in my learnings what do I do well here's 
what helped me one is find a community find people   to hold you accountable so this might be either a 
slack group you're part of a Discord group you're   part of or maybe it's even just telling your 
friends and family what you are learning and what   this really does is it holds you accountable to 
learning and not only does it hold you accountable   but you also get to share what you are learning 
which really helps as far as reiterating your   learnings and your skill sets and where kind of 
whole Slide the other thing this does is that   hopefully and if not you need to do this is set up 
a schedule a learning schedule and I really really   do not want you to be learning every single day 
on top of working on top of studying whatever the   case may be this is because you are going to burn 
out it's just you know it's one of those things   where working too much having too much on your 
plate it's like one plus one equals two it's going   to happen you need to enjoy your time learning
