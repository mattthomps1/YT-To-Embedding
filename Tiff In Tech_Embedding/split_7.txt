of it's just a fussy programming language trust me it was my first my first job was with PHP and Symphony so I get it but also to Ruby on Rails JavaScript Frameworks they all emerged and they kind of offered similar or better capabilities and in turn because they were open source they were more cost effective for these companies another reason that cold fusion eventually declined and is no longer around is because of the learning curve and proprietary nature so as you know Tech is all about being open source and sharing information and with cold fusion and the proprietary nature and unique syntax that it had it made it less accessible to new developers and they didn't want to spend the time learning this these declined with many other factors made cold fusion not so cold anymore not so hot anymore gone you know what I mean all right those are the five technologies that I would not be learning in 2023 and will not be learning in the future unless something crazy changes and it comes up that I need to uh but I really really hope not anyways I'm curious to hear your thoughts do you agree with this do you disagree what are some other Technologies you would add leave in the comments let's have a good conversation around this and uh hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career related videos now I gotta go feed my dog who was parking earlier like how rude [Music] thank you
