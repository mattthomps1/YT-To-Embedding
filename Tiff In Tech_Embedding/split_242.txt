okay do you want to know one of the hardest
things that I found when I was first learning to code well specifically learning react I
should say was search functionality and I think it's because searching through an API
or a list it seems so simple in theory similar to a to-do list but in reality it can get
complex pretty quickly and it's one of those things though that when you actually do take
the time to really understand how it works and go through the process of building it
it's one of those things that will stick with you and it really helps solidify a lot of
the fundamentals so today we are going to be building a react app going through search
functionality of a really fun API also too I want to include I feel like I've done a
few of these code with me videos and we don't talk about git very much so we're going to
speak about that in this video as well and of course another thing similar to git in
the sense of we don't talk about it a lot but it's so important is documentation I'm
going to be sharing with you a tool that a lot of your employers will be looking for
if you have skills around or have used in the past and let's just dive into it okay
let's go [Music] okay so as you can see on screen here we are going to get into the react
app in a second but as I mentioned earlier I really want to focus on other parts of the
development process you know a lot of these codes with me are a round code which makes
sense but there is so much other tools and things that you need to be aware of as a developer
or someone interested in coding so you can see up on screen here I've
