 for you or 
create questions for you that might be asked in   an interview setting and you can create quizzes 
that are technical soft skill related however   you want to so I just have on screen here an 
example literally just typed in quiz me some   python interview questions and what it generated 
is a list of 10 questions now listen maybe some   of these questions aren't common in interviews 
for example an interviewer might not ask you the   generic question what is python but these are 
questions that will really help you prepare for   an interview you should be able to explain what 
is python in a few simple sentences you should   be able to explain these things how do you write 
a unit test in Python how do you open and read a   file in Python the interviewer may or may not get 
this specific but these are good challenges for   you to go along as you are learning to be able 
to understand your level of knowledge are you   able to do this and it really also helps you feel 
more confident as well when you are going into   the interview this is a great way I think one of 
the best ways actually to really start practicing   four interviews when you as you are learning so 
you can start literally from day one or two and   questions that really entice you or interest you 
like wait I really want to dive into that how do   I write a unit text in Python and there you go 
if you're confused as to where to even start with   your learnings this is actually a great way to 
go as well starting with interview questions and   narrowing down on what interests you or inspires 
you
