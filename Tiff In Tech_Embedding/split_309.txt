o take over software Engineers jobs 
or developers jobs what it will do is will enable   us to be able to work on more complex issues and 
that's really why it's so important now more than   ever to be a continuous or forever learner what 
you know today the skills you possess us today   will be obsolete tomorrow relatively speaking but 
you need to continue to level up and upskill now   I'm not saying to spend every week every waking 
moment learning something new but rather be aware   of what's trending be aware of what's growing 
and what's out there and if you find something of   interest to you stick with it and continue to grow 
your learnings in that direction for example a lot   of people right now are continuing to learn about 
blockchain and web3 actually speaking of that that   is next on our list blockchain developers are 
continuing to become more and more in demand I'm   sure you've seen articles where they're making 
half a million plus doing their jobs like it's   crazy how in demand they are right now and they 
will continue to be although you know we hear   Horror Stories of the crypto market and what's 
going on in that world the technology the actual   blockchain technology is not going anywhere and 
I'm not saying anything else is either but I'm   saying we have to remember to really separate the 
two that blockchain technology can be used for so   much more than just currencies and the companies 
and the increasing number of companies that are   continuing to implement blockchain Technologies 
is huge from Healthcare to sports teams to every   industry
