ing about is when you are talking to people 
or yeah having different conversations with people   pretending you know sometimes everything they're 
talking about when maybe you don't because the   reality is that is okay and you actually sound 
more intelligent asking questions about what   they are speaking about then trying to pretend 
you know everything just because you don't know   something that they are specifically talking about 
doesn't mean you are dumb doesn't mean you are not   as smart as them it means you're not as versed 
in that subject as they are that's all it means   and by asking questions and getting curious it 
means that you want to learn you want to hear   more about what they're talking about and I think 
we often do this or I often did this especially   early on in my career because I was scared that 
people would think oh she's not that technical oh   she's not that smart you know she doesn't deserve 
to be here so in turn I've just nod my head agree   and then spend more time than I probably should 
trying to look up what they were talking about   or making mistakes along the way that didn't 
need to be made because of that and I think   that's one of the biggest things that I hope you 
can get comfortable with is ask asking questions   being honest and upfront with your knowledge in 
a specific subject when they come up throughout   conversations and that's something that it takes 
practice to do especially asking questions and   being vulnerable like that because it puts you in 
a position where you're saying hey I don't know a   ton about this
