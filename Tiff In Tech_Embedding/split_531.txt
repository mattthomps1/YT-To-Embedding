red Android Studio though uh you will be learning more about software development approaches and after that one thing that Android and iOS both cover is getting back into react Basics and react native and I love that they do this as well for Android because once again it really sets you apart having more skill sets then of course you will be doing your Capstone project as well as coding interview prep now Tiff you might be asking well should I take one the iOS one or the Android or should I take both and my answer to you is it really depends I would suggest focusing on one achieving that and then seeing how you are feeling you definitely can take both and it will also of course add to your resume but it's also not necessary okay let's talk a little bit about database engineering well before we get into it what exactly is a database engineer let's go to Google our our trusted Source because I'm scared if I'm going to tell you something that's wrong I just it's too too risky what does a database engineer do database Engineers create and maintain databases okay well yeah that makes sense they design the database engine processes for sorting and accessing information so they use programming knowledge to build data pipelines and integrate new information into existing databases and this is actually it would be a really fun job I for my first job as a software developer I worked a lot with databases and it was so fun because I mean it depends on what language you are working in or what you are working with but for myself for example I was uh working with mySQL and it was so cool
