here's construction going on and in this case we are going to be accessing our downloads so replace Tiffany Jansen with your name or the name that's on your computer [Music] so check if um the file path exists let's remove it and let's print something to let us know successfully being deleted ah delete Ted okay there we go and then else the style oh it's really annoying that I did one with one quote and everything um okay so we have a file path here as you can see but we need to give it a specific file so let me go my downloads folder I am not going to show you this folder because it's a disaster this is why we are doing this and one file that I want to delete today is two dogs surgery but once again you could we could replace this and make it Dynamic to delete all PDFs or delete everything in the downloads folder I just wanted to start small to show you this also if you didn't catch it from last time a simple way to run a python in your terminal is right click and then I was like right or left click right click and then go run python file and terminal should get successfully deleted this file has successfully been deleted yay but then if I was to run it again because now it doesn't exist it should say this balance on exist there you have it those are two really small but fun things to do think of different ways that you could even put these together and it's really just playing around with different modules in Python doing some kind of conditional statements and um whatnot but it's such a fun way to think of different projects to build and expand upon so I linked my GitHub
