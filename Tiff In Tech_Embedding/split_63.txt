ding I thought you know what I know the basics I I'm pretty proficient I think I work for a company I can develop large websites I should be start doing this for others and I didn't know where to start that's the first problem I ran into I thought where do I go on one of these online freelancing resources do I talk to my mom and see if her friends need a website like where is this network and that was an issue that came whether it was the chicken or the egg meaning I want to work but I need to find clients but in order to find clients I have to work this kind of circular thing that kept on going on so for me what I did was I started by utilizing my own network so I literally made work for myself help meaning I knew my dad needed a website he owned a construction company and I thought you know what I'm going to get you a website he maybe didn't need one his business was far along that was more word of mouth at that point but I thought this is a great opportunity for me to build and then also to have something in my freelancing developer portfolio to show others that hey look I built this site for this big construction company I can do this for you too and so that's how I really started was by making my own work and honestly I do think that it's a great way for anyone to start if they are wondering or having that same issue as they don't know where to start they don't have that work necessarily although it's not going to pay right out of the gate but it's a great way to kind of appear as though you're working like have have that magical or myth about you and then others see t
