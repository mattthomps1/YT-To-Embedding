the most you can also use it to help you debug   and explain code this is great as you progress 
in your learnings that when you're coding on   your own you might not understand something or 
maybe you're still in the tutorial portion of   it and you need it explain it in a different way 
also tip actually let me show you and this can be   code that you are getting explained to from your 
tutorial maybe you're onboarding at a new company   or in this example I have free code cam up on the 
screen here and I literally just did I searched   up samples of python code and this is a really 
actually this is a link this free code Camp down   below because let me scroll up without making you 
dizzy here it is very long article it's a really   helpful article because it does go through what 
they will cover for different uh Topics in Python   so if I go to let's go to recursion because that's 
so hard to explain especially or grasp when you're   first learning so it does do they have in their 
own blog a little article or a little summary of   what exactly recursion in Python is but if you're 
having some trouble still understanding it let's   let's go let's do this in the Fibonacci function 
copy it go in here and then go explain to me and   then once again this is key explain to me 
as an engineer as a kindergartner however   you want so I'm going to say explain to me 
in very simple terms what this code does   I think say explain to me what 
this code does and you will get   a response but the more specific you 
are the better result you will get says I'm gonna be so I'm gonna b
