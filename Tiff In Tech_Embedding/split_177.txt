man-like 
responses really human-like responses the product   immediately gained so much popularity and actually 
within five days of the release of Chachi PT it   gained 1 million users a put up on screen here 
a graph because I think it took Instagram I'm   going to quote it wrong I think it was six months 
or so I'll put a graph on screen but you can see   just how quickly AI this chat gbt AI has been 
catching on people are gravitating towards it   think of AI as a tool to help you so there are so 
many other tools that you use in your day-to-day   when you are coding think of AI more so as a 
tool that will help or assist you so we use   tons of different Tools in our everyday coding 
already and this is just an additional one it   doesn't have to be look looked at as the sense 
of this is the tool that's going to take over   my job just because it knows how to code a bit I 
mean even before we had chat GPT there was what   is that popular one I'm blanking Now give me 
a sec GitHub co-pilot of course we had GitHub   co-pilot and this has been around or used anyways 
by the public more frequently or longer than chat   GPT and then for some reason because chat GPT got 
into all this hype the fear that came along with   it was real or it felt real anyways but rather 
than looking at it as something that's going to   take over your job start looking at it as a tool 
similar to Google similar to stack Overflow these   are all tools that we use or resources we use 
on a day-to-day basis and now ai it's providing   us some more tools more in-depth tools also on
