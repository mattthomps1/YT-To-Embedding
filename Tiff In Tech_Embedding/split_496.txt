 you don't you're behind yeah yeah   businesses solely rely on it right now i know it's 
it's crazy i um when i was i was looking at uh   because vidcon's going on right now and i was 
scrolling through social media and i saw someone   i followed was going to the talk where uh duolingo 
duolingo am i saying that we're obsessed we're   upset they're so really nice do an amazing amazing

new tick tock from them or something their social   manager has done such an amazing job with like the 
community side of it or anyone that doesn't know   it's an app yeah and it's something that we would 
not normally be interested in what is it teaches   you to learn languages learn languages but they 
are they have the most incredible tik tok it's   so entertaining you don't need to be interested 
in the app but they just do an incredible job   and that's like the power of it so we're obsessed

like no no not us it's not our eye great great   leadership and they even make jokes about that 
on their tick tock and stuff like sometimes   she'll post a video that like social manager 
and have the caption about like i'm gonna get   fired when my boss sees this yeah and it's like 
they allow them to push those boundaries and i   think that's something that a lot of larger scale 
corporate companies do
