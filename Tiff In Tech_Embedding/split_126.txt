I was thinking it could also be set a reminder let's let's get into it so let's paste this here use Python to build a voice assistant that can help you with tasks like setting reminders creating to-do lists and searching the web that was really cool you can use speech recognition libraries like speech recognition and Pi TTS X3 my pronunciation on specific modules or packages is really bad so if I'm saying it's terrible let me know I'm still kind of new to python honestly I've been a JavaScript developer for six plus years professionally but python is something that I would say up until about a year and a half ago I really started tinkering with and it just like exploded my love for it because it's so cool and so friendly and so many things you can build anyways as a side note let's see what it says you can see though when I did this prompt I was pretty specific as things of what packages to use uh what I wanted to do for the task so the more specific you are the better result you will get all right let's see it's generating we'll speed this up [Music] so you can see here on screen it wrote the code for us and it also gives comments as well as to what it is doing so let's kind of go through this as you can see here we're defining a function to speak the text so what we will say and it will be running and waiting and then as well listening so Define a function to recognize a speech so print speak now then when it is listening down here if we scroll you can say remind me in the command create a to-do list and also search for so let's take this code now knowing that we're going
