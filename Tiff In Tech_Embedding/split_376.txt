courses 
because it teaches a modern C plus plus rather   than an obsolete version that many courses will 
be teaching you now this course is pretty long   in length it's about 45 almost 46 hours actually 
in length and that can be intimidating at first   to many why am I going to take this course that's 
so long but one thing that really helped me or I   really enjoyed about it is how well it's broken 
down into sections so just as another tip for   you what I do when I'm taking a course is I will 
break them down into or I'll schedule my time and   learnings based on the sections that's already 
broken down into okay those are the top five   programming languages for 2023. now let's get 
something clear here just because these are the   top five programming languages for 2023 doesn't 
mean that there aren't tons more out there that   are in demand and I want to make that clear 
because sometimes I'll get comments being like   well Tiff I really want to learn um I really want 
to learn go I really want to learn this and that   you don't have this on the list still learn it the 
whole purpose of this list based on the research   I've done isn't to say these are the only five you 
can learn but to inspire and inform you of what   is coming up for 2023. also I want to end this 
video with a final note a lot of times we make   these videos talking about the technical skills 
that you need to learn which are so important but   even if you have the strongest technical skills 
without the soft skills it's going to be hard to   grow your career in a very successful long-term 
way
