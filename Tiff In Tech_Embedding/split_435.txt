why is coding so hard to learn and does it 
get easier all these amazing engineering   leaders seem to have it all figured out are 
they just Geniuses or what is the secret   today oh geez okay let's just you know today 
I'm going to be covering with you why exactly   when you are first learning how to code it 
can feel so difficult so challenging and of   course learning anything new comes with a lot 
of challenges but for some reason when we are   learning how to code whether it be your first 
programming language or even if you've been a   software engineer for quite some time I mean 
it definitely gets easier with time there is   hope for you that is just starting out but why 
is it so hard to grasp and I want to share with   you today my thoughts around it okay also can you 
believe in literally less than one week less than   one week actually in a few days the interact 
conference is happening which I am so excited   about I'm curious to know who has signed up for 
it as you know it's a completely free virtual   conference that is happening on October 25th this 
is a conference I went to last year and I still   keep in touch with a lot of the speakers that were 
there they are engineering leaders they have some   amazing advice to give I felt like I took away 
from the conference a lot of insight a lot of   knowledge but honestly most importantly in my 
opinion is a lot of inspiration in how I can   grow my career so whether you are just starting 
out in your Tech Career or you are an engineering   leader yourself there is so much value that 
you will gain from this c
