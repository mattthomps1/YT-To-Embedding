made   it i think the first time that we looked at each 
other and we were like yeah we did that was just   at our two year we were we're having lunch with 
our team and um one major thing that kate and i   we like really wanted when we first started was to 
create a space that felt safe to work at a place   that people wanted to be a place that people felt 
valued our we were first and second higher ones   you know so we wanted we know what it felt like 
and we know what we wanted to create and sitting   at lunch we had our team walk around the table and 
everyone shared their like rose bud and thorn and   rose is like you know like your peak your 
highlight yeah thorin is like the least thing you   enjoy or but is something you look forward to and 
it was so great listening to everyone but i feel   like the consistent theme on everyone was just 
that they just feel hurt and they feel valued and   they are they were just thanking us for creating 
this place and we just kind of like looked at   each other like yeah we did that that's huge that 
gives me chills yeah it's the most important thing   as you know when you are an employee to feel heard 
to feel valued because that's missing in a lot of   a lot of places we were just so proud i think that 
was like our main goal at the beginning we're like   we're so proud that we hit that two years in and 
we haven't had high turnover everyone that's been   with us has either been with us from the beginning 
or joined in the last few months and it's like   just means the world that that's something we 
were able to create that is
