d one here which was not necessarily a tech programming language related because I know we have a lot of viewers or a lot of people that watch these videos that are not programmers and the third one that I really wanted to highlight is agile the agile methodology and listen don't come at me with the butt Tiff but Tiff there's butts for everything we all have a butt that's kind of weird I don't know why I just said that but but you get the point what is the waterfall methodology well it essentially is when a team starts with a big plan and then they work their way through that plan throughout working their way through that plan there is no iterative Sprints there's no feedback there's no potential to Pivot you have a plan of what you are going to build and you have your focus you are building it whereas nowadays a lot of companies most companies use What's called the agile mythology which is you work in Sprints a lot of times it's two week Sprints for example you have tickets that you are working on uh specific to the Sprints so for example if you are in a product manager role you are assigning these tickets if you are in a developer role you are taking these tickets and you have this chunk of time where you are building after that time is done you meet and you iterate based on what you've learned from the Sprint feedback maybe from some customers bugs that have come up what this does is it prevents you from working in this kind of linear fashion where you can't see anything about the end goal in turn you can actually see what you are building and move pieces along the way n
