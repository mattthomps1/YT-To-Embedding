  but it feels to be like you know we're opening 
we're creating some sort of like an open sourcy   platform yeah kind of like you can integrate 
anything to it right like you can plug anything   so what does that mean for designers so in general 
designers we're not our Focus really because   um unlike no code Solutions no code Site 
Builders where the expectation is that the   designers will come in into like this platform 
and we'll be using the platform as their design   tool right like they'll be using uh like Wix 
webflow Squarespace uh this group uh and and   like we'll go there and use whatever that 
platform is offering them templates specific   design tools play with that some designers will 
be able to tweak more with some coding some not   um so that's one approach with stack but we 
were like okay we're not building a design   tool yeah we're building the integration and and 
all that and we will enable like visual editing   on top of of things but it's like it's going 
to be like pretty rigid like that's how we saw   the experience because we wanted this to be more 
focused on um you know creating Pages fast but but   but realizing and understanding the fact that hey 
for a large project large websites there's a large   team so and there's like dedicated developers 
yeah that are gonna do the heavy lifting of the   building because performance is important 
because the Frameworks used are important   um so that was the focus right like we're 
gonna give you developers everything they   need to build the most modern website but then 
we can neglect content crea
