ech industry   I find especially when you're starting out people 
are like oh PHP but once you grow in your career   I think it's a really really great language to 
learn and it's used in so many different areas   that it's a really important one to learn as well 
then as I progress further in my career I wanted   to pick up Python and this wasn't because it was 
required in my job but it was required or sorry   wasn't required but it was something that I was 
super interested in it's very popular and I knew   it was a skill or a language I really wanted to 
know so I did the self teaching method at that   point it was really easy because I had already 
picked up two other languages now I want to take   a second to note here that when going back to 
JavaScript when I was working my last job at IBM   I was on the Consulting side so I was doing a lot 
of projects for different companies which really   meant working in different Tech Stacks so the main 
one I was working with for a framework was angular   but also there was some react as well and then on 
the side I was tinkering I would say with view a   little bit it not so much anymore but I found 
that as I progressed in my career whether it be   for my day job or even through you know Finding 
resources and learning for this channel for my   tech Channel it slowly became less about learning 
new programming languages and more about learning   new Frameworks especially with JavaScript but 
that's just the way I preferred to grow it doesn't   mean it's the way you have to go going back to 
how many programming languages do
