 in working in security analysis   auditing systems engineering or really anything in 
between and this is something that I had trouble   placing because as cyber security becomes more 
important I wanted to put it higher on the list   but there are other ones that we will get to which 
overtake it in in many ways which you'll see but   this is a great certification it's recognized 
across the industry it's a pretty intense exam   and certification to go through but if you are 
really interested in the systems engineering   side of things this is of course to really 
look into also with this certification it's   important to note you will still need education 
or continuing education after you complete it each   year you will need to maintain your credential 
chills even after getting the certification this   holds it to really high standards to ensure that 
individuals who say they have the certification   have completed this course are really up to 
date with industry best practices now next up   is a certification that does not require technical 
skills however I see a lot of software Engineers   growing their career in this direction can you 
guess what it is project management and I know   some of you are either for project managers 
we love them others of you are probably like   I haven't had a great experience with them 
I don't really love them but regardless   they are very vital and key part or key aspect in 
having a business running properly so the project   management professional or PMP certification 
has been around for quite a while evolving and   updating i
