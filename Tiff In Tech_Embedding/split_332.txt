cript that will take a PDF and turn it into an audio file oftentimes if I'm studying or learning something new and it's in PDF format and I have to spend so much time reading it I would prefer to just be listening to it so I built a script with python that will take any PDF and convert it into an audio file let's get building first thing we are going to be building as I mentioned is turning a PDF into an MP3 file and this is super simple there's two packages required but before we get into it last time I made a python project I got a lot of questions around setting up the project in Python because last time we used replit this time we are in vs code so I'm going to share with you a few commands to a ensure you are installed python is installed and really how to get your virtual environment running first thing we need to do is check that you have python installed or what python version you have and of course if you don't have python installed pause this video and go install it we're not going to do that in this video because it's pretty Excel explanatory online all right so you can see I have python 3.9.10 installed then what we need to do is get our virtual environment up and running so first of all you can see um in the project I already have it up and running but just to show you what I did so type in this command here then we type in source it's not not there okay so now you can see we are in our virtual environment next up we need to install these two packages so we go and once again I am the worst seller on the planet so let me just copy this command I've written down
