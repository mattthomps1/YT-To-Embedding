re definitely not alone yes and it's so easy to   it it's it's so for me anyways I I I still 
sometimes feel alone and I mean now when   you go online and all that it's an amazing 
Community but I I definitely feel like I   I can't I'm even starting out now like for 
young women who are breaking into Tech it's   there is so much that you have to overcome and 
so much things of doubt and I I have had so many   moments where I'm like is it worth it you know 
having those feelings of being alone and isolated   and and you know different work environments 
you know just different things coming up right   and that's like way more important for a woman 
to be in a culture that they can see themselves   grow in that is inclusive um I feel like that's 
not as important for our male counterparts but   um like you work for a startup now yes right 
and my one of my best friends just started as   the first woman hire in her startup and you 
can like she rants to me all the time about   like how the culture is not as accepting as 
a bigger company yes and that's how you lose   women in stem and I I one of my videos um was 
sharing this recently that 40 about 45 of women   um like leave stem yeah more at a rate faster 
they they leave at a 45 faster rate than men do   um so if we like built a culture of belonging I 
know we could keep them even to and on that note   of culture belonging even to just speak I had 
um I had um another another individual on prior   to this I'm not sure which will air for like the 
order of this but maybe not but we were talking a   lot about imposter syndrom
