ll start 
a blog post and won't finish it for a while as   I'm learning the thing but then as I continue 
to grow my skills in that technical area I can   continue to rework the blog post and then 
share it another thing I do that or that I   think I'm guilty of and I really try not to do 
is cramming cramming is something that is so   easy to do where you have one day and you know 
you can spend hours working on this thing or   so much time and you're gonna you know achieve so 
much throughout the day with it but then in turn   you get burnt out often and then the other thing 
is you don't oh this chair's a little squeaky   so you get burnt out very quickly and then the 
other thing is you end up kind of resenting what   you are learning so then you don't look forward 
to learning you don't look forward to the next   steps with it so I really suggest that you do 
not cram cramming is something that as humans   we want to do just like shove all our learnings 
in one day but even if you have the full day   available really set your limits for me I would 
say on average I do about I'm learning something   new maybe it's like 45 minutes 45 to one hour 
sitting down and focusing in on something and   then even if I'm going to learn more throughout 
the day I'll take a step back go for a walk get   a breather and just give my mind a break because 
you're learning especially when it's technical   things it's very it can be very draining it's a 
lot especially when it's a new technical topic   so don't put this pressure on yourself to study 
or to you know cram in something for 8
