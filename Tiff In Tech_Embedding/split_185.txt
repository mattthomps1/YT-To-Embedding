 
grow in your programming career maybe there   will be times where you you will use it or tools 
like it to write different functions for you or   and build more code for you but at that point 
when you are doing that you will already   understand as to the purpose behind it when you 
were first starting out learning to code do not   use these tools to code for you in turn yes you 
might get more coding done faster we'll build   projects faster but you won't really know what is 
going on behind the scenes and that can get very   difficult then when you go for interviews you are 
explaining code and genuinely want to grow your   skills you need that Foundation all right I hope 
you enjoyed this video a little tour of New York   while I embarrass myself filming in public for you 
because I love you all so much and I hope this was   really valuable as far as how I would learn 
to code again in today's environment with the   use of chat GPT or other AI tools and if you are 
someone who is learning to code leave down below   what programming language you are learning 
and I will see you all soon thanks everyone foreign
