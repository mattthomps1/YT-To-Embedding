my phone so I will actually kind of make different 
questions and answers for myself that I can come   back to at a later time and this has been a really 
great and effective way for me to learn new things   because what it will do is I'm writing down taking 
notes as I am learning and then if I'm on say the   train or the subway and want to you know get in 
15 or 10 minutes of refreshing my memory I will   go back to these cue cards on my phone and just 
kind of quiz myself and it's a great way retrieval   learning to really focus on what you learned a 
few days ago and keep on reiterating over and over   that because sometimes our minds need to hear this 
information more than once well most of the time   they do and this is a great way to do that so I'll 
link Quizlet down below as well it's a completely   free or I use a free version anyways of it to quiz 
yourself and on the go when you have a few minutes   it takes four or five minutes all you really need 
and it just keeps on getting your mind thinking   about the topic thinking about the subject 
that you are learning on a more frequent basis   okay those are my main tips I would say for 
tricking your mind to learn anything faster and it   really is an art that and everyone's so different 
but I really think those are some tricks that no   matter what uh kind of learner you are will really 
help Quicken or speed up your learning time and   it's different ways that will help your mind get 
better at learning it's honestly an art in itself   which I think is not enough people to speak about 
is the science behind it
