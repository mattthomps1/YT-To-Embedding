the path to becoming a blockchain engineer is   much more there's less hurdles you will have to 
overcome versus if you are just starting out and   that is because you already know programming you

you really just need to level up your skills focus   in on that area which I think is really exciting 
uh because it's not something that you have to   go back to school for for another four years 
or anything like that and even if you aren't   a developer already but you want to become one it 
definitely is a great path that you can focus on   as well also as a side note if you are looking to 
learn more about web3 and building web 3 I am this   isn't a sponsored anything but I am a huge fan 
of buildspace.so and it just has I'll put up on   screen here because it has some amazing resources

more so accurate uh range so what I did was when I   was searching blockchain engineer initially I 
came across this article on hired.com and the   salaries of candidates
