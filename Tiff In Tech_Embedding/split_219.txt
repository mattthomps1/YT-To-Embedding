okay you know one of the things that I am terrible at probably makes me a horrible person I always forget to send happy birthday text messages to my friends I love my friends you know and I mean well even if I write in Google Calendar it's something that my mind my brain doesn't have space for for whatever reason so naturally like we do with everything in our lives I'm like why do I not have this automated why do I not have a python script running that will check yearly to see when it's January 29th or when it's February 15th whatever the day is for my friend's birthdays and send out happy birthday text message so of course I got to work and did just this I'm using chat GPT really enabling or trying out to use chat GPT to build this for me I mean we're talking about automation here let's see how much we can automate with our code now there are a lot of alternatives to chat GPT I'm not saying it's the best one to use out there I'll list some down here but because it's so hyped up right now and everyone's talking to them like I gotta use chat GPT for this so in this video we are going to be building a python script that will run creating a job that will run and check for a certain date you can put whatever date you want in there a specific time and then we're also going to be using twilio I love twilio it's so much fun to automate the process of sending out text messages and in this case sending out happy birthday but we can really alter this code for whatever reason you want all right let's get into it oh if you haven't already hit that subscribe button I love making these v
