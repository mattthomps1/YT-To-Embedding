 many have asked if if this is not that In Demand anymore and people aren't learning about it as much the people who do have these not this knowledge to maintain these systems because there is still systems out there that are using it they must get paid pretty amazing and of course this depends company to company I can definitely see if there are programmers who have been working in Cobalt for many years at the same company they probably are banking a really large salary the average when I searched up online salary for a Cobalt programmer is between 60 000 and 100 000 U.S now I I think there's a lot of factors and variables that this isn't telling us here like how long these programmers have been at these companies what does that really look like like are they just using Cobalt or do they just use some knowledge to that and work with some more modern ones really interesting so back in the day back in my day I should say five different glasses I don't know that's how grandpas do maybe not okay and I'll go over here no I'm just kidding not that was not my day I was not born yet but back in the day why was Cobalt so popular just out of curiosity what made it so popular it was specifically designed to cater to business applications and data processing tasks on mainframe computers so it was used extensively for many different purposes some including Financial Services government systems you see that's a huge area where it was used a lot in payroll and HR inventory management Etc and it's really interesting because a lot of high profile organizations actually still rely on cobalt
