hen we get into a role yes maybe you're coding or speaking about technical topics but it might be very specific so you want to ensure that other areas of your your skill set are staying strong as well another great question our new grads are early career software engineer positions safe or can they be resigned rescinded before starting work so it varies company to company so I don't want to say yes or no but yes I've heard stories of people who have you know accepted the job offer they're ready to start and then they get an email and unfortunately they are not going to be with working for the company this is absolutely terrible and I can't imagine how that would feel um how devastating that would feel and I can see as a new grad or looking for your first job how terrifying this can feel and I think to really answer your question if you are someone who is studying currently or looking for their first job you just have to be aware of the market right now and then also kind of mentally be prepared for it meaning that it's not something you did wrong or it's not it's not personal it's just the way it is right now and rather than looking at it as beating yourself up or worried about it you just have to put yourself out there hope for the best and if it doesn't go as planned know that some that company wanted to hire you and thought you were so amazing so so many others will too it's just gonna take a bit of time so for anyone who has experiences I cannot imagine how that would feel but it's not you personally and I think that really helps when you take the the personable aspect
