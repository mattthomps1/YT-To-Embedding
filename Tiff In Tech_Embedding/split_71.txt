 I hope that really helps you and gives you a sense of what to expect when you are freelancing it's not just focusing on the skill you are hoping to focus on is running a full business it's managing people it's managing people's crazy expectations sometimes and how to make sure they're aligned properly and I don't want this video to be about scaring you away from freelancing because there are so much great opportunities within it but I think it's important to take it slow take it one step at a time maybe you start with one client while you're still working a full-time job or while you're still in school but I know everyone's different but I would highly recommend in this situation to not just jump off the deep end by completely quitting your job completely quitting school and just going right into freelancing just start small see if it is for you because oftentimes it's something that is glamorized when in reality there is a lot of work to it and you really need to look at it as being your own business owner alright I hope you enjoyed this I'm curious to hear though where are you at in your freelancing career are you someone interested in freelancing what are some questions you have that maybe I didn't cover leave in the comments and let's answer each other's questions and uh this is really loud and uh go from there all right hit that subscribe button thank you all for watching and I'll see you soon thanks everyone [Music]
