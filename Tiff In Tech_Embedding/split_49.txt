I found this skill or this trait to be super interesting and it is actually backed up or said by a Silicon Valley based investor named Zoar zor arwa I'm pronouncing this wrong I really apologize I hate pronouncing names wrong this individual says the next decade of I.T will be an age of shared cognition driven by increasing adoption of cognitive technology ongoing concerns about the scarcity of human attention and a need for independent individuals of trust which have yet to be developed so what does this mean what is this person predicting essentially it means the willingness and ability to partner with AI not only on decisions but also too on executions now this is looking ahead to 2030 but we see this happening already right now we see that there is this friction between developers or individuals who are willing and open-minded to using Ai and what it has to offer and then we see this other side of individuals who think no we are not even going to touch AI it is scary it's not for us or maybe they don't even think it's scary but it's bad or we're not using our own minds there's a lot of thoughts going on right now and I completely can see both sides of that right now there is a lot of the unknown right now and what he is predicting is in the future we will use AI alongside us and I really think this is extraordinarily uh the way of the future and going to happen we see it happening already and it will continue that way AI is not going to get Dumber it's just going to get smarter and smarter and the people who will continue to evolve and really grow in the next few years
