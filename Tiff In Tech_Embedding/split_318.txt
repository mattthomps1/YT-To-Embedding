at Etsy so it has all the key metrics in there to   measure for um like a time period like let's say 
two weeks that's usually um how we test each of   our new features and then by the end of the two 
weeks I will report and conclude the experiment   and um like there will be a financial impact and 
a customer impact so I measured that at the end   and do like a post analysis wow that is super 
interesting and I love how you said uh it's   something you've always been interested in with 
around experimentation and that's kind of how   kind of going back on that note really how did 
what is tell me a bit about your background what   led you what was your schooling like like 
how did you kind of discover data science   um so I grew up in the Silicon Valley okay 
and that's that's All Tech I was surrounded   by Innovation growing up my dad is a director of 
infrastructure so he's a software engineer yeah   um and I I grew up really loving Math and 
Science um so when I went to college I graduated   with a it degree um but I didn't discover 
data science until I went to Grace Hopper   celebration which is the largest celebration uh 
and Gathering of women technologists in the world   um so that's where I discovered data science 
it was the track that interested me the most so   so when you're at Grace Hopper you follow a 
track of sessions and I learned so much about   experimentation like multivariate experimentation 
and um was just so inspired I never knew that this   was um a part of software engineering because when 
you major in computer science you have to find
