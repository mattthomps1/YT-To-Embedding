 is so key to remember when you are getting into the world of freelance too because a lot of times when you're starting out with one client and it's going great but if you break your reputation you cannot think to yourself oh this one client's a one-off it will never get back to others it will it might not be a week it might not be a month but it will It's a Small industry especially in the freelance World in Tech and your reputation really does precede you now the opposite is true too if you start with one client and they really enjoy you they are so much likely more likely to refer you to a friend or another business it might not be immediately after but there will be at some point a referral from them and this is a really common trickle effect then you work with them they have a great experience and then before you know it you do not have to do any advertising or promotion for your freelance work which by the way you might be asking what's it do I do a freelancing website or get on a freelancing platform and at the end of the day it's up to you as I mentioned for myself I really I don't know what it was but I just wasn't drawn to it I think because of all the fees that uh the platforms take and also to I just it just didn't feel right for me so what I did was once again start out more of the organic way where I built a website for my dad and then through that he shared it with his Network I got another client once again that might not always be the case for individuals and then definitely go check out some of these freelancing platforms that we're all familiar with right
