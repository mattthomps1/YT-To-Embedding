be we'll   be doing a webinar around using his technology at 
his company and mine at my company which is going   to be really cool and exciting and that was they 
had those two meetings and then I took some time   to work on a video I have been creating around 
how our product works at a high level so this is   a video that is for Developers for a developers 
page we are working on and it goes a little bit   into how to integrate the tool initially with a 
product project I should say then after that I had   lunch I had two more meetings one with a design 
individual one with the developer experience   person who we connect with as well he is always 
building really cool projects and I always connect   with him on what he is working on too then after 
that what did I do today after that I continued   on the video I was working on the how it works 
video and then I did research For an upcoming   webinar that we were doing another demo one so 
it's a lot of media things research building   content oh and then I didn't and then making sure 
Discord is functioning well meaning if anyone has   a question around it but this could vary day to 
day once again it might be more so preparing for   a webinar a few days ago I gave a demo and it was 
not targeted towards just developers so it had to   be more higher level but it's really cool I just I 
absolutely love this role I think it's a great way   to really grow your career I'm super passionate 
about growing my career and continuing to   level up step up and this just seems like a 
great balance between getting to interact with
