o say generate prompt and then tab and then it would continue so that is one way okay interjection in this video here this is in the future Tiff in the future and I have on screen here some code I got the code to work I realized what I was doing wrong and honestly this is what happens when you are genuinely learning and building in public so you can see here I have Rebel pulled up I switched from vs code so I'll share as well my Chris microphone I'll share as well the rebel so you can play along with it but essentially what was happening why it wasn't running is I was not giving it a specific prompt so you can see here I'm using the text DaVinci model engine and similar to the examples in openai there is the prompt we are giving it the max tokens you want to use different things like that so down here in response we're calling this function get response and this one was an example that they gave for give me the text or the color based on a mood I am feeling or anything like that so let's go ahead and run this and this should return a hex code here there we go perfect and this returns a really nice blue color by the way and you can do anything here so right let's try this I don't know if this one will work I don't know if this exact prompt but let's try write a SQL query for me that [Music] um yeah sure we'll return a list all the users the ghost The Ghost Writer is working for me let's see this might not work I don't know yeah so this is a very simple example but now you can use it essentially for turning text into SQL to get different uh color scheme different hex codes th
