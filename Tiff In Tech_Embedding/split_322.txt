ifferent people have different 
reactions but a common one was almost like oh so   you just you sit behind a computer all day and you 
don't talk to people I'm like that is the furthest   thing from the truth and I think you and I'm sure 
for you as well even like hearing about how Monday   to Wednesday is a lot of meetings and you need 
so many soft skills you've got to utilize so many   soft skills as well right yeah um a lot of my job 
is actually like communicating with stakeholders   yeah and if um I find that being a good data 
scientist is asking really good questions and   sometimes you kind of have to fish that out of 
your stakeholders like what are they really trying   to ask what is the real problem we're trying to 
solve yeah yeah wow that's really interesting   and then on that note kind of sauce what I what 
are some qualities or if someone's considering   getting into data science uh aside from of course 
you know the technical skills that they need to to   possess what are some other qualities that you 
think it makes a really good data scientist I   know you mentioned asking really good questions 
what else can I blow my nose yes of course um so I I think data science is just as much an 
art as it is a science and we both come from   the creative modeling field um and posing requires 
a lot of creativity yes um so when you are solving   a data science problem you it's you really have 
to take a creative approach and like let's say   you don't have enough data you have insufficient 
data you need to apply an algorithmic approach   in solving the problem and
