er in this video and it's something that I agree with no longer can you be an expert in just one software well sorry let me rephrase that yes of course you can but is it going to be in demand will it continue to grow in your career probably not you need to be open to learning these new softwares new programs that come out even if you're not a developer but not being scared of touching technology working with programs even if you're a project manager being able to use different tools as they come up that are more in demand or more popular and being open-minded essentially or a forever learner is going to be so key so this brings us to the question these rules that we're talking about or these skills we're talking about are becoming less and less in demand how do you ensure that what you are doing the skills that you have will stay in demand that you are actually on a direction that will continue to grow and not become obsolete I think the trend that I'm hoping you see throughout this entire video is you just need to be open-minded and a forever learner and I keep on saying that I know it probably sounds cliche after a while but it's so true jobs are going to continue to change as AI continues to evolve and grow and a lot of the jobs we see today we will not have in the future and that's okay it doesn't need to be something we're scared of or worried about rather excited about and look at it as a positive that frankly We're All in This Together it doesn't just affect Tech roles it affects you know for example even with chat gbt you hear stories now of how it can pass the bar
