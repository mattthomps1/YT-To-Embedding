retty much gone you cannot just let the code speak for yourself or get hired just based on being this amazing coder and some of you might be thinking well Tiff actually yes you can they need Specialists they need that yeah they do but guess what you can be a specialist you can be an amazing coder and also have other skills to go alongside it and I really want to bring this up because I think a lot of times especially when I first started to learn how to code I would come across or meet these senior Engineers who were not so personable let's say or didn't seem to have very many other qualities other than their self-proclaimed being amazing at coding skills and what I'm seeing more and more now is because coding is becoming more accessible people are able to learn it quickly with all the resources out there even with the tools thanks to AI what's happening is people are also developing other skills they're learning how to code but they're also public speakers they're also great collab Raiders are also great Educators and what's happening is coding isn't becoming less in demand but people who possess multiple skills not just coding skills are becoming more in demand I hope that makes sense is that clear leave down below if that's clear or not I guess what I'm trying to say is coding itself isn't going anywhere it will continue to be in demand yes certain jobs with encoding will maybe fall to the side and whatnot but if you are someone who is continuing to learn an upskill you're fine as long as you're also someone who's willing to possess other skills to other human skills I t
