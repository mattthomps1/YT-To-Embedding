er Quantum Computing to me is something that's so fascinating and we're really just on the brink of but I can't I'm I'm still trying to grasp it fully other than you know some definition so here's what I've heard Quantum Computing is an area of computer science focused on the development of Technologies based on the principles of quantum theory so essentially when I type in what is quantum Computing for dummies it's a field of study centered on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory it's fascinating and I think we're just at the brink of what's possible with this and next up is robotics robotics is a field and technology that involves a design construction and operation and use of robots and well one of the main functions of a robot is to be able to carry out tasks autonomously so meaning it doesn't need the human intervention as it's walking or as it's doing its task and there are many different types of robots they don't all look like these cute little robots we see in images some examples of robots that are used in everyday life I mean by everyday life throughout the world I should say is let's say the Roomba a popular vacuum cleaner that's made by iRobot it uses sensors to navigate the room it doesn't need human intervention typically and also too it avoids obstacles while also cleaning your room another example that I'm sure we're all familiar with is Boston Dynamics robot this is a dog what looks like a dog and I want to take it home it's not even real that's how this technology plays tricks on your mind I see the Boston Dynamics dog
