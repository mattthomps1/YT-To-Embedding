 is for you and explore it just because   you commit to one thing today doesn't mean 
you need to do it in 20 years from now and   that's the beauty of the world we live in is I 
think our roles and our jobs will constantly be   changing as our interests do too because now we 
have the technology to support us continuing to   evolve in that way I hope you enjoy this video 
not only understanding what jobs are going to   continue to be in demand but also understanding 
that yes there are jobs that will be taken away   from us but how can we navigate that in the 
best way possible if you haven't already   make sure to hit that subscribe button it really 
supports me and also leave in the comments other   questions you have that you want me to answer
