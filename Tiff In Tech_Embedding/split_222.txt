let's copy this code here and as it's telling us we need to replace account Sid and auth token and then also to schedule a script to run so I'm going to get this code working first to test out and then I'm going to come back to chat GPT and give it more commands to create a job for us so it will run yearly okay let's go I don't know why I get so excited about the stuff that I do okay let's go back into vs code [Music] paste and we need to do Sid and your off token so let's go to your twilio I'm using my test credentials here and then enter in the recipient's phone number for me I'm going to enter in my phone number just to test it out kind of thing and then from this is just twilio's phone number okay so first things first let's see what happens when we run this actually we've got to install these packages here [Music] so let's go back to vs code and do this we want date time to be installed perfect and we also want I believe it was client to be installed let's go back to here perfect client or sorry that wasn't fine it was import client from twilio rest oopsies foreign I think we're good all right so what happens if we run this let's just test it out no module named twilio while it's installed twilio [Music] now I must type something in wrong there we go now what happens if we run this mm-hmm maybe it's because I was using the test account okay hold on a sec here okay you know I didn't do I didn't update the uh from number twilio phone number so make sure you update it to whatever twilio phone number they are giving you so I just did that there let's go ahead and run this
