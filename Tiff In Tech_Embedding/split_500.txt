d in it not just like   slapping their name on it this is my thing and 
i think the validation as well because that's   going to initially sell it and it's going to 
be like oh wow i want to get this product from   whoever i'm obsessed with but once you actually 
try it you need the validation behind the product   and a lot of people are bringing in experts 
to speak to it on their internal teams or   positioning here's how we're different whether 
it's speaking to like the formulation the   ingredients the community aspect but it's really 
having to differentiate yourself in that way   and then from a smaller brand perspective i think 
it's again how you're presenting yourself yeah and   i think content has a huge play in that because 
that's what's going to capture people's attention   and like tension spans are short so you have 
to make sure that you're consistently up on it   and i feel like we're repetitive in what we're 
saying but it's just like making sure you're   staying with these trends making sure that you're 
staying true to yourself as well because if you're   copying somebody you're always going to be one 
step behind and you are going to fall behind   that's so true you know going back to attention 
spans i i uh my my boyfriend in the evening he   sits on the couch and then goes on it drives 
me nuts but he doesn't put his social media   on silent and i'm like can you just please put 
on silent but i found it so interesting because   just as a human behavior it's like it's every 
maybe one to two seconds it's a different noise   it's a different sound it's
