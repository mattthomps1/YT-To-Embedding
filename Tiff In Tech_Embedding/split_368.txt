I have a tech interview coming up and they're going to ask me about microservices how do I easily explain them I'm going to explain to you what microservices are but first we need to go back to before they were widely used prior to microservices being widely used it was a monolithic architecture that was used a monolithic application is built as a single unified unit one of the largest problems that enterprises face with monolithic architecture is scaling think of it like a sports team in the case of a monolithic sports team if a team member was injured mid-game the entire team would need to be replaced or the game stopped so we could practice more AKA test you can see how this isn't very effective now enter microservices software is composed a small independent services that communicate over well-defined apis going back to the sports team analogy if one team was injured the support could solely focus on them replacing them with a backup and then getting them up and running without the entire team having to shut down
