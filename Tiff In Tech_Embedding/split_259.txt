I have to make this step or do this role 
for a little bit to get to my dream career and   I think that's really important too is just 
realizing that your first job your second job   your third job might not relate to your your 
biggest dream career but it takes time and I   think the journey is so rewarding on its own just 
being able to know that this is the direction you   want to go into and the last thing I really want 
to highlight here is we evolved we evolve and we   change so what does that mean well for finding 
your dream career it's important to do all the   things I mentioned to really help hone in on 
where interests lies and trying new things   and applying the 10-minute Rule and meeting and 
networking with other people or even if you don't   like networking at the very least just talking to 
under other people to hear about their experiences   the biggest takeaway though is we have I mean I 
have a computer sitting right here we have most   of us do anyways we have the internet at our 
fingertips and with that comes a lot of power   we can literally learn whatever we want whenever 
we want I think the biggest thing for me is the   biggest secret I realized is don't overthink it if 
you are passionate and interested about something   and you have gone through the different steps 
and it just seems to really be a good fit then   just go for it I think we truly live in a time 
where what we do today what we do for the next   decade doesn't have to equate to what we do for 
the following decade meaning I feel like in our   parents generation or you know depend
