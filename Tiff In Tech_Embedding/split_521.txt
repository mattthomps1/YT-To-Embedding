 coffee chat or some information they might know someone who you can connect with and why I think networking is even more important as you get into the tech industry at an older age than say 19 is because you're going to be networking oftentimes with people with your peers with people your age typically especially if you're going into leadership or asking people about leadership and you might not be starting in leadership but you know you want to connect with other leaders and this might not always be the case that they are older but most the time it will be and what this does is it puts you on their radar and it makes them aware of you it really shows initiative too if you are someone who's like hey I'm not in this industry but I want to get in it this is what I've done and this is where I'm going that is huge huge the other thing I would do aside from networking is be very strategic in the companies I am looking to get on board with I would be very strategic in that because if you are someone and this might not apply to everyone but if you are someone who's breaking to Tech at an older age and you don't want to work with just a bunch of 19 or 20 year olds which if you do that's great there's nothing wrong with that but if you are a bit older being strategic in the companies you look for seeing the members on their team because sometimes it's nice not to feel like a complete lone fish in the pond and have people surrounded by you who are similar in age maybe they are further along in their career but they can relate to more personable things with you another thing I think
