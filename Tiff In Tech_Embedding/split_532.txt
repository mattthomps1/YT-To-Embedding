to see for my first time writing queries and how they're kind of singular similar to English but they're so different you feel like you're writing this like secret language I don't know maybe that's me nerding out but I think this would be a really great job okay let's jump into this course so as all the courses in this it's taught by meta uh one thing that stands out for me right away is of course that they teach mySQL database management data creation querying and manipulation so similar to what I was just saying they also teach you how to code and use Python syntax and how to prepare for technical interviews for database engineered roles and I really like that because there's not a lot of database engineering courses out there that I'm familiar with anyways and it's really great as well that they have in the preparation for technical interview Parts because yeah the resources are not as as much as I would say the other two we spoke about okay introduction to database yes that's amazing Version Control we know that's with all of them database structures and management with mySQL this is a great way I really like how they added this in first because my sequel is pretty user friendly it can get complex fast but pretty friendly to learn with first so I really like that that's kind of your first introduction into this and then it goes into advanced MySQL topics uh which is a great way to continue to grow and then they go into programming in Python which is I mean python is a great language it's so in demand that the fact you're learning python in this I think is a huge plus a
