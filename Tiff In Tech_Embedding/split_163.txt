in a bit here how to do that let's just put   that there temporarily and also too we will 
need to define the API URL which once again   let's just continue on and then we'll 
we'll get to the API stuff afterwards   okay and then the first one is now let's 
start with convert the convert button   convert and then we want to add a listener event 
essentially so when the button is clicked uh click   then let's create a function here oops I'm 
doing this backwards oh it's early in the   morning to be honest it's not even 9am which
