ends okay I'm back in a different location 
this is Tiffany coming from the future and the   reason being is when I was going through this 
video and uh working on it I thought you know what   this is something that I really want to use on 
an ongoing basis on a daily basis I want to get   these notifications every day so I decided to 
use AP scheduler and we'll go through the code   here essentially it is a python module that will 
allow your python library that will allow you to   schedule when the code executes so this could 
be on a daily basis this could be on a monthly   whatever the case may be now you have to keep 
your application running for this to Executive   course but it's still but it's super interesting 
and it's very simple I've never scheduled a job   to run on an ongoing basis before for one 
of these projects so I was really excited   to play around with it so let's dive into it 
to make us get this notification if there is   an iPhone that is under a certain price every 
single day and you can see how handy this is   for various projects actually I use this library 
on New Year's when it was at 12 a.m I scheduled   because I would be sleeping I was a very I had a 
very quiet New Years and I knew I'd be sleeping   so I scheduled that at midnight for text messages 
to go out I use twilio and this Library here for   text messages to go out saying Happy New Year 
so there's so many different things you can   use with this library that let's dive into it 
for this project and it's just a great tool to   use for various projects so okay enough of me
