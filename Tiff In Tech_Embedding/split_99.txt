zing patterns and oftentimes play a very important role in applications using natural language processing so think of it as image recognition or speech recognition next up is quantum Computing and I'm not going to lie what did I do before I started doing this video I went on chat GPT and typed in this exact thing I'll screenshot it actually explain to me quantum Computing like I am a child because this is where where it needed to start everyone needs to start somewhere and I really like the example it gave so let me share it with you imagine you have a big toy box filled with lots of different toys whenever you want to play with a specific toy you have to look through the whole Toy Box to find it this can take a lot of time especially if you have a lot of toys now imagine you have this magical power that lets you look through the entire toy box all at once and pick out toy you want to play with this sounds much better right I agree okay so far so good well in a way that's what Quantum Computing is like instead of having to look through all the possible answers one by one like a regular computer does a quantum computer can look at all the possible answers right at once and pick out the right one mind-blowing this makes certain types of calculations much faster and of course more efficient than a regular computer can do and it straight and States at the end which I hope we all can take away Quantum Computing is much more complicated than finding toys but this is a great example for someone who's just entering or learning about Quantum Computing for this one I needed my comput
