ice and this is used 
right here result price this result is still here we don't need this perfect all right 
let's try this one more time here to remove two extensions exchange rates 100 Canadian okay we are back and I figured out what was 
wrong you can see I have a bunch of console   logs essentially what was happening is we actually 
need to wrap this entire file in an event listener   for when the index HTML file has already loaded so 
we were loading our Javascript file before we were   loading our index index HTML and therefore all 
our get Elements by ID were null so I will share   that code with you in a second here but before I 
go up there to show you that I also want to share   with you that I update the code in a few places 
so I actually renamed this to result price and I   think we we spoke about this result price which 
is once again here and then as well the data is   not just rate it's exchange rate this goes to I 
feel like I'm being The Stereotype of read the   freaking documentation all right so now I was 
just testing it out by going into dragging the   index.html file into Chrome here let's do one more 
time before we go 100 convert from Canadian to US   and we can see also isn't that not insane 
100 I'm Canadian I go to the us all the   time if I buy something that's worth 
100 Canadian I had to pay 135. which   is mind-blowing mind-blowing let's go back 
over to the extensions and we can just refresh   exchange rates and we can see now let's 
try this here as well Canadian convert   and there we go we did it this is so cool this 
was so fun and simp
