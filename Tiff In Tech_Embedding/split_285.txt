 minutes so imagine   using bright data in a larger application or at 
work uh hint if you want to stand out to your   bosses I would definitely suggest you share with 
them about bright data but I also want to share   with you other things it has to offer so right 
now as you can see I'm in proxy manager and this   is a great way an advanced open source tool to 
really help speed up development time and manage   any proxy operations so there's a few features 
that I want to highlight here from live preview of   the whole traffic logs and statistics IP rotation 
session management it's just incredible and it's   all in one platform so also too they have a Chrome 
extension different API and Integrations and then   of course where I was in the data collection 
platform so bright data has a range of options   that you can utilize all within your company 
or if you are building your own product okay   I don't know about you but that was really fun 
to do and it's literally something I'm going to   be using on a regular basis now to notify me for 
product updates especially for the iPhone but as   I mentioned this can be used for any product 
and there are so many different templates to   choose from if you're wondering why I'm sitting on 
the floors because the camera keeps on dying and   we're just keeping it real and organic over here 
I linked bright data down below so make sure to go   sign up give them a checkout it's I I have so much 
fun playing around with them and just seeing all   the possibilities also too I will link this code 
down below so you can add on to this
