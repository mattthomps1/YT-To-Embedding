currently my favorite thing to do I get really passionate quickly about this because it's so fun so for example I a while back I built a react app and I was going to build it out as a purpose-wide built it in react uh that was a taking a food API and randomizing the results so every time I clicked on a button it would output a different type of food and what this would do is tell me what kind of takeout I should order that night because ordering food is so difficult getting deciding on what you want to eat is impossible so I was like let the code do it for me that video is now at 2 million views which is crazy but it just goes to show how fun it can be to build solutions for real life problems and whether it be something that orders food for you whether it be picking out your outfits uh different recipes to cook with different drinks to make the list is endless but it's a really great way to get very invested in a project because you know you will use it afterwards it's something that actually solves a real world problem okay I can hear my dogs in the background they're shaking out meaning they want to eat I hope this video was really helpful and valuable to you though on providing inspiration or places to look for inspiration on different projects to make and I can completely relate and have a lot of empathy right now for people who are struggling to find projects to make or ideas to have because for the longest time I was super inspired and I didn't have this problem and it was recent I've been like where where is this inspiration going to come from so these are the ways
