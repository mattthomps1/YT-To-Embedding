ted in other areas they 
are not but as it continues this technology   continues to get better and better things 
like truck drivers taxi drivers Uber drivers   we'll continue to diminish at a very quick rate 
and what about Courier Services when you think   about getting a package delivered right now a lot 
of times yes it's done by a person but imagine if   it was drones that are delivering all our packages 
or having this kind of grid system in the sky that   they are in charge of or deliver I know I sound 
like I'm getting a little crazy a little out there   but if you would have explained to someone five 
years ago even what our world looks like today   they would have thought the same thing and this 
is a really interesting and fun topic to start   thinking about I would say fun but I know for some 
people it can be very scary because maybe you are   in one of those roles and that really brings me 
to sum this up which is at the end of the day   the most important thing is to continue to level 
up continue to upskill gain new skills gain new   skill sets and the best way to do that is right 
at your fingertips with the internet there are   so many different courses so many different 
programs that it's not necessarily resources   that are lacking but rather what is lacking is 
you need to find your passion and the best way   to do that is spend a few few different days or a 
few different hours of a day really understanding   where you get passionate what excites you you 
know maybe watch a video on blockchain maybe   watch a video on data science see what that
