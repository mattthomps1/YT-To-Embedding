owing transparency what companies are hiring from Junior to senior level engineers and what they are paying now keep in mind this is total compensation this is not just being a salary and I really wanted to highlight that because I don't want there to be any Mix-Ups here thinking this is base salary no this is total compensation and I mean the base salary is pretty nice too though let's be real for a lot of these companies are paying very high base salaries too but the point of this is transparency we need more of this and I think this is a great place to start all right let me pull it up on screen okay I have it up on my screen here and as you can see the lowest total compensation this is in US dollars for an entry level engineer is 220 that's mind-blowing this means this is mostly people who are graduating from University and they're starting with this this is definitely definitely not what I started with when I uh started my first job it was at a non-for-profit so that also made it very very low in salary uh but as you can see the headquarters there is a trend here most of them are in California now a question I get asked is well Tiff I don't live in the United States I live in Canada I live in Asia I live in Europe wherever you live can I work for these companies and the answer is maybe what I mean by that is a lot of these companies nowadays are hiring for remote workers especially Engineers that can work and be done from anywhere and what I think is really important is when you are looking at applying to these companies who are based out of the United States ensuring
