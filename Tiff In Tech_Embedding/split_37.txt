eeing technology that is already being evolved but when you think past that what I'm talking about is also too let's think about logistics and Freight AI will revolutionize the logistics and Freight industry by optimizing supply chain operations route planning and also to delivery schedules going back to its teaching itself and learning data recognition pattern recognition it will understand what is the best way or the best route for Freight trafficking for Freight trafficking is that what it is Freight Transportation you know what I'm saying also too when we think warehouse management right now this is done to a scale with AI and there's still a human kind of navigating it and understanding what's available and where different containers can go but as AI gets smarter it can recommend to us humans the best way to manage these crates or where to store how to store them the best kind of pattern it's really interesting when you start thinking of Transportation path just driverless cars also to a way we see AI used already which will continue to be enhanced is in Intelligent Traffic management so AI driven traffic Management systems that will optimize traffic flow in real time understanding where it is busy how to direct traffic better if there's no one at the stop stop light then maybe if there's no one at the green light but everyone's waiting at the red light then understanding when to flex on that it's pretty interesting to think that as we continue to advance it with AI our literal lives will be in the hands of it with our modes of transportation I think I'm just coming to
