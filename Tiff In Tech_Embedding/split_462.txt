 or coffee and Tech in 
general they go hand in hand in my opinion I'm   curious though are you a coffee drinker or 
are you more of a tea person do we have tea   drinkers in the audience here let me know okay 
let's get to the question here though how many   programming languages do you need to know as a

JavaScript and honestly it was a really good first   programming language to learn for me I think if
