rocery shopping with   me here quickly but long story short multitasking 
when I was speaking about that just a second ago   the problem with it is that too often than not we 
end up doing a lot of things at once really poorly   and this is something I used to do while trying 
to maintain uh my studies and then also learning   on the side for example I was going to school for 
graphic Communications management and then also   learning coding on the side so studying while 
learning a new skill and I oftentimes would try   and find times during my lecture or on my lunch 
break to fit in studying wherever I could I could   fit it in here's the problem with that though it's 
quality it goes back to quality over quantity when   you start just trying to squeeze and studying or 
learning new things on top of your studies on top   of your full-time job what this really does is 
yes you might be checking off the box that you're   learning something new but are you retaining it 
are you in an environment where it is best suited   for learning are you learning at your optimal 
time these are all things that we oftentimes   just push to the side just to say we got it done 
almost versus quality and actually putting in the   effort and energy when it is best suited so what 
do I mean by that well we all have an optimal time   for learning for example for me I learn best in 
the morning I know after 3 P.M yes I'm definitely   working still but I'm not there's no way I'm going 
to be learning something new after 3 pm it's not   going to my brain will just not retain it and 
there are so m
