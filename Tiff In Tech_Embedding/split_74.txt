eally trying to State just that we need to take a step back from building Ai and AI that is smarter than gpt4 what does that look like maybe let's take a step back and have some rules and regulations around it before we really continue to forward ahead now personally I don't think that will happen companies are very motivated by money and there's a lot of money in AI it's a Gold Rush right now so for them to actually listen to this letter and take a step back it is highly unlikely but very curious to hear your thoughts about this point being though it's just the beginning and the tip of the iceberg as to what is to come which leads us to the question well how does this affect our jobs especially people who work in Tech I got a message recently from someone who wanted to get into web development and they said Tiff I'm really interested in web development but I don't know if it's even worth learning anymore and this is for obvious reasons when you think about the way AI has already supported and is helping developers work so much quicker from cogeneration bug detection automated testing and further right now you can literally highlight a piece of your code and it will spit out a test for you you can highlight pieces of code and it will explain what the code is doing for you now I'm not saying these tools are perfect but the fact that they exist today means they will continue to get better in the near future Tech is evolving so much quicker so we cannot just look at where we came from how long it took to get here because that's not the amount of time it will take for it to mov
