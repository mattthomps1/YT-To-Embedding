software developer there are so many different   roles within AI that you can pursue whether it 
be specializing I mean there's so many courses   actually which I'll I'll list here I'll put on

many roles looking to be filled but it doesn't   mean that there aren't a ton of others out there 
for non-technical people that need to be filled   and you need to have a deep understanding of AI 
the good thing is there are so many courses out   there that you can take right from home even now 
this is one of those areas that if you are looking   to break into Tech or maybe even evolve your

online where businesses go online the demand for   cyber security Specialists whether you are a cyber
