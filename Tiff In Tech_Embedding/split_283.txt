let's get back into it okay so as you   can see here I added in AP scheduler now let's 
go and install that so pip install AP scheduler go oh come on all right perfect okay I also 
imported uh pits pipes pits I'm not 100 sure but   essentially what this is is it will be a python

function called it's called send notification   you can't spell today what is new that's

uh pits so let's go time zone equals   hits and then get the time zone and we are 
setting it to for me anyways I am setting it   to us Eastern you can read the documentation 
if you're sending it to something else   all right there we go it is mad about us 
don't need to be mad go we're not mad anymore   not gonna lie I'm a JavaScript script girl 
I feel like python with its indentations   all right so now let's actually uh 
schedule the function to run daily so   scheduler dot add job you can see we have 
some different options here we are going   to do send notification which we created up 
here and for this it's going to be a Cron job I'm telling you if you could count 
how many times I mess up my spelling   if I give you a dollar for each one we'd be
