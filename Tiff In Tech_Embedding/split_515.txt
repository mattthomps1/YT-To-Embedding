what exactly is an api and why should i care an api stands for application programming interface and and you're using apis every day that's why you should care when it comes to your weather apps when it comes to going on social media your banking apps essentially think of it as a way for two systems to talk to each other two systems to talk to each other can you give me an example a real world example so i can break it down easy next time okay yes this is my favorite robot example that really helped me grasp apis so imagine going into a restaurant you of course have the person who's ordering the food the customer and the person who's making the food the chef but how do you get your request of what you want to eat to the chef you need the waiter and think of the waiter like an api so essentially you give the waiter your request they take that to the chef and then to get your food the waiter takes their response from the chef and brings it to you that really helped me the waiter is kind of like the api there
