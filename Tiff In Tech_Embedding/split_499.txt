s sometimes no i think   most of the conversations are around what 
the goal is what you're hoping to achieve   sometimes we work with teams and they have 
great um marketing teams internally and we   work with them as an extension so it works hand 
in hand and we're like you know double the power   sometimes we are working with teams that are 
kind of like this is what we hope to achieve   and we don't know how to create it and we present 
you know a full-fledged strategy so it kind of is   depending on the founder the team what scale 
of their business they're at but depends   with all those okay so let's talk a little bit 
about you know kind of what we were speaking   about with content and standing out but especially 
right now i find and really for the past few few   years celebrities uh pushing out beauty brands 
or pushing out different kind of brands and it's   it's noisy out there there's a lot of things 
going on how do you ensure that the brands you   work with stand out maybe the smaller ones 
or you know not the massive brands i guess   you could say i think it's crazy though because 
even from like the large scale brands obviously   um celebrity brands are huge there's so many 
consistently coming out it feels like especially   this year it's like every single week there's a 
new brand and they're all in the same space so   it's a matter of how you're positioning yourself 
to stand out and i think a big part of that is   authenticity especially if you have like 
a huge face of the brand it has to feel   authentic and has to feel like they're 
actually involve
