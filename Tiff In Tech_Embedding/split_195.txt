  was recognizing okay there's other people like me 
I'm not alone I'm not the only one who feels this   way so why not try and network and meet people in 
a way that I feel comfortable with which for me   is one-on-ones which is coffee meetups or coffee 
dates whatever you want to call it and so that's   what I started to do I remember the first person 
I networked with was a cyber security engineer   actually at Shopify here in Toronto at the time 
and I didn't know her at all but I reached out to   her I actually reached out to her via social media 
which I don't advise you to do I would do LinkedIn   instead of social media but she was very active 
on social media and I just said hey you know I'm   going to a boot camp that's located right next to 
Shopify I have a few questions for you about how   you got to become a software or a cyber security 
engineer what your role entails could I take you   out for coffee at a time that's convenient for 
you as simple as that really honing in on your   eagerness to learn that you want to connect 
finding a time and place that's convenient for   them if you're doing just virtually than just a 
day and time that's convenient for them doing all   that heavy lifting you could say so that they 
just have to show up essentially and you carry   the conversation or have the questions prepared 
and I think that's one of the biggest things I   really wanted to hone in on is for networking find 
what style works best for you whether it be in you   thrive in large settings because maybe it's not 
so personable and so one-on-one or maybe you'
