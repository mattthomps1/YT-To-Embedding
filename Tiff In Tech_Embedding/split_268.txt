hing and saying I just sent off my resume and cover letter I'm very interested interested in this position and here is why and this will really show them that you are someone who isn't afraid to take initiative that you're actually really interested in the company that they are working at and you care about it you position yourself in a place that you stand out from the crowd at the very least they will take time to look through your resume also make sure to include your resume again in that message number three on this list is not using your network and don't give me this excuse up chip I don't have a network I don't know anyone in the tech industry because guess what I didn't either before I broke into it so how did I manage to do it I made a network and that's what you need to do too just reach out to people on LinkedIn you know I know it's terrifying I know it's scary and I know it sucks it's not fun putting yourself in these vulnerable situations where it's just like can I connect over virtual coffee or you know I love what you're doing like let's connect it's just it sucks it's not fun and if you think it's fun I wish I had that emotion or skill because I don't think it's fun at all but it's how you see results quickly is through connecting and building relationships with other and even if you feel like you don't have any direct contacts within the tech industry or for the role you are applying for that is okay what I think is the best thing to do then is to start sharing with others you are looking for a job looking for a role in Tech whatever specific one it is and
