a stepping stone and it feels like it all led to   meeting this girl and starting our business 
together wow two years ago two years ago yeah   kate what about yourself um i'm kate the other 
half of bank and i'm just from outside of toronto   i've been here for almost eight years now which 
is crazy went to school here and it feels like i   kind of grew up in the city even but um nur and i 
met i feel like five years ago now and that's how   we first started like working together got to know 
each other and it just like really spiraled from   there into this but it's been such a crazy few 
years especially of bank and like the years before   that even i feel like they've gone by so fast i 
bet i bet well you know we keep on mentioning bank   now let's talk about bank what exactly is bank for 
those of that are not as familiar with it and uh   how did it come to life yeah so bank is a social 
media digital creative agency um we even hate the   word agency it feels like a little bit outdated 
for what we do we we kind of offer everything   that a e-commerce digital business would need 
in the space so we offer social media management   content creation photo shoot production influencer 
marketing email marketing everything that's kind   of organic and and not on the paid side but we 
really focus into the like kind of fast-paced   day-to-day execution tick tock really is a crazy 
space we focus on right now because not a lot of   agencies can create content on the go match the 
trends keep up t
