lso are speaking to stakeholders as well 
which I really like so it's kind of The Best of   Both Worlds you still get to work on your soft 
skills and improve those while also working on   your technical skills so primary duties include 
analyzing sorting and sanitizing data to yield   actionable actionable I can't speak today sorry 
it's okay to you actionable or meaningful results   also find better ways of collecting data to get 
meaningful information and create reports that   are human friendly and readable kind of going 
back to presenting this to the stakeholders now   what let's get to the most important part how much 
does a data scientist make now I just want to give   a little side note here these numbers this total 
compensation that I am doing is just at its total   compensation so it's base it's Equity it's stock 
Etc and I'm referencing them from levels FYI I'll   link it down below they have a ton of different 
roles I'm on there right now and based from a   ton of different locations levels of your career 
Etc so for data scientists the medium this means   if you're taking into account the Juniors as well 
the very high seniors as well but on average it's   around 125 000. so you can see how as this 
is the medium as you grow in your career it   will go quite higher than this and also too as 
you're starting on your career you can still   expect a great salary to begin with now next 
on the list is cloud architect and once again   I'm sure this is not surprising to many of you 
a cloud architect puts an organization's cloud   computing strategy into action
