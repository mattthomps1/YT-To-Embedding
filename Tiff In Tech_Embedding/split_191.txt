exam it can do all these different things in all of these different areas it's not just technology and I think that's really important to note too it makes me feel a bit better when I sleep at night knowing that if my job's taking over probably everyone else's job's taken over too and we've already moved on to figuring out a new way of life maybe it involves it's not working at all on that note of dreamy if not working ever again AI is doing everything for us I don't know let me know down below other comments or other ideas of you that you have or you see trends of of skills that are not near as in demand as they used to be in Tech or maybe they are on the way of becoming obsolete it doesn't have to be negative it has to be something we are aware of and take action on thank you all for watching and I will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music] foreign [Music]
