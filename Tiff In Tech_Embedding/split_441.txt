meone a tutor to sit down with   me once a week I was building a react project and 
I was actually working at the time as a software   developer very early on in my career but I was 
still learning react I was working more in the   back end side of things and I was like I just want 
someone who is an expert in the front end expert   with react to sit down with me once a week and 
just like soak up all their knowledge now maybe   this isn't feasible for you know some people 
I'm not saying to have to you have to go and   spend your money on a mentor or a tutor for me 
it was completely an amazing investment because   I learned so quickly so much information because 
I was able to have that one-on-one with someone   who's an expert all right let's talk about it 
you know it's coming this word that's so overused   imposters but it's true it really can slow down 
your learning A lot of times we question are we   good enough are we worth it am I skilled enough 
to learn this new thing and it can really slow   down your learning to the point where it almost 
freezes you that you stop learning for a while   because you think maybe this isn't for me this 
is for you if you want it and it takes time as   I mentioned earlier it takes a lot of time and 
it's one of those things that you just have to   keep on repeating it's like a muscle I always say 
the more you practice the stronger you will get   okay those are some things that I think really 
some insights into what makes coding difficult   to learn but at the end of the day it's one of 
those things that I really believe anyone
