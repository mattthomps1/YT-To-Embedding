 is starting to touch and blockchain 
developers they're responsible for Designing   creating implementing distributed Ledger systems 
that facilitate transactions between two parties   without the need for the third party so similar 
to how cryptocurrency works but you can think of   it used for so many other things it's of course 
important to have a deep understanding as how   this technology works and one of the great things 
about being a blockchain developer is if you are   already an engineer or developer it's pretty 
simple to get into that area of specialization   if it's something of interest to you there are 
so many great resources online I mean there is   for everything I'm listing here that you literally 
just I think more than anything you need to find   something you're passionate about next on the 
list is robotics engineer as robots continue to   become more and more popular this role continues 
to grow as well and it's such an interesting role   it's something that you know if I was to do it all 
over again I think robotics engineering would be   such an interesting thing to explore and to become 
a robotics engineer you have to have an in-depth   understanding of engineering principles and be 
able to apply that knowledge to the development of   robotic systems so this could include designing 
the robot's components testing the system for   functionality programming it and so much more 
I really like it because it's an interesting   mix between the software you have to have software 
knowledge but also Hardware knowledge as well next   on the list is vir
