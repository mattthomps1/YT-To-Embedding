 in it's going really fast now   um or more specifically our engineering team 
has built stack beat Tech beat has built is   you can take any content source so whether it's 
apis whether it's a headless CMS database and   utilize CSI I haven't said it out loud too much 
CSI so I'm still getting like comfortable with   that I try to avoid it yeah but you can utilize 
you can then work with CSI and integrate it into   to your workflow so what this does is it allows 
you to um connect to some really cool stuff one   being figma which are solutions engineer Joe uh 
connected to figma's API and I'm going to pass   it on to you from here I'm just like putting you 
on spot with it but it's pretty amazing yeah so   figma was like I feel like an like not something 
that anyone had really in mind when buildings CSI   uh I've been thinking about like integration 
with figma from like the first time I met   um our Founders ohadendan where they introduced 
stacked me to me I was like all right so this is   kind of like a side Builder but way more Technical 
and like everything is react based react component   so I feel like there's something there that can 
click at some point yeah and I've tried to pitch   this a few times and I feel like we didn't 
really feel the that it had enough substance   until uh CSI showed up and really opened up the 
ability to integrate with like any content Source   any framework whatever you throw at it we can 
we can integrate with it at stack bit which is   um kind of like an man I'm definitely gonna say 
something that Simon our CTO is gonna hate later
