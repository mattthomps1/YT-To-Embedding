torial but I'm not going to pick up 
one of these courses where it's 50 hours plus long   I think if you're completely new in learning 
a new programming language or learning a new   stack then that might be necessary but if you are 
just learning a new technical topic try and keep   the chorus to a minimum we don't need to spend 
50 hours in one course on there rather I would   suggest breaking it up so maybe take a course that 
is two hours or three hours long and then go back   to writing about it or taking notes like physical 
notes the physical notes I don't know what the   data is around it but there's so much information 
and studies that have been done around how taking   actual notes with pen and paper I'm talking will 
really help you reinforce your learnings and   remember what you are learning better and when I 
was doing research on this and just getting really   obsessed with this topic I came across this video 
it's called 10 my tricks to learn anything fast   and I was like what are they recommending what 
are they suggesting and one of the things that   they recommend is called a study sleep study 
sandwich and I'll link the video down below   because it's a great video as well that has some 
really interesting ideas and what it is really is   scientists who have put their focus and study onto 
the best ways to learn new things quickly have the   number one thing they have figured out or done 
research on is the study sleep study method which   is study for a short period of time and sleep 
or take a break then come back to studying and   what it does is it
