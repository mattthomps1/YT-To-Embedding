okay i'm a little tired of the arguments out there against the graph view essentially they go like this because i use a different application that doesn't have obsidian's incredible graph u it means graph use are dumb it kind of sounds like sour grapes well that mixed in with the stubbornness people like copernicus were all too familiar with but we'll get to that later in this video i'm going to do two things at the same time i'm going to show you how the graph you can actually make you a better thinker and i'm going to do that by giving you a sneak peek into one of my favorite activities note making if you're fairly new here you may be asking what is note making well if note taking is leaning back and listening note making is leaning forward and adding to the conversation we need both but too many of us are all wrapped up in the note taking that we don't even realize there is another way note making is about wrestling with the ideas you encounter and making leaps of insights across domains and interests and all of this helps to coax you into a state of mind where you are thinking critically creatively connectively generating next level amounts of insights so what are insights well they are these valuable nuggets that are the result of us trying to make sense of things so how do you generate more of these insights actually the better question is where where do insights come from the intersections valuable insights are generated at the crossroads of unexpected ideas that might be why you're here at linking your thinking because in some shape or form you have recognized that maybe you can generate a bit more value in your world with your specific situations and use cases if you can just figure out how to make these unexpected ideas connect okay so how about i get on with it and actually show you how i use the graph you to think better how my note making leads to sense making which leads to valuable insights unique perspectives and a lot of joy okay now that we're done with all the bombast of the opening i'm going to settle in i'm going to hunker down and just start note making and i'm going to talk out loud what i'm up to and i think we'll kind of see some cool applications of the graph view and i hope to show how it's really helped my thinking come along so as we're looking at the screen right now first thing i'm going to do is just clear it out so what i first do is i just hit this workspace that closes everything and then just for fun i can kind of reopen i'll resize this tag pane because i don't want it to take up too much space and then same thing for well that's a good size there now i want to do some note making how do i get into that how do i find the notes that are important to me so i can work on them hopefully i've kind of like tagged them with something that would be the best approach something i'd recommend and so something i've done is i have nested tag under state that is called develop and it looks like i have 33 notes that have this tag i just kind of let those things stay there and slowly if it is for whatever reason resonating with me then i think to myself hey why not add that tag and uh see what happens so let's click on this now what that does is it loads up a list and usually what i like to do is collapse just so i can see you know all the work all the file names nice and clean and what we see here is a list but that's where it becomes a little hard to work with and it's it's a linear list what if we were able to complement the list with something like the graph view and that's exactly what we're going to do so let me click open the graph view and well that's interesting so let me just hit tag oh wow i didn't have to type anything i just hit a couple tags and i've pulled up my nested tag state develop and now we see this pretty cool graph i know it's small for you right now so don't worry i'll i will be zooming in but what i want to point you to is how i'm using both a linear list and a graph view together so now let's collapse the right side give us a little bit more room collapsing that and let's get rid of this filter so we can see a little bit better so what are we looking at here let's get our bearings in the center we have the tag that we decided to search and that is in this cyber cyan color and then any real existing note is this yellow neon yellow and then if it's a note that hasn't been created yet it is purple our lines are faded blue and then we have little tiny arrows there that you can't really see indicating the direction so this gives us a nice starting point and we can consider how we want to have a fun note making session so i'm actually going to get rid of the side bar right now so i can even zoom in further i'm just going to start looking around and kind of see what the low hanging fruit is the the stuff that's going to be fun to jump into so skin in the game that looks enticing uh priming okay that's that's always a good one so i see a lot of concepts here that make me perk up and that's kind of what i want in this space something what do we have here emergence is seen in large groups what was i thinking there ants bees birds trees and humans okay well actually recently i've been kind of getting into mycelium and actually have a note on that so i'm just going to link it right away mycelium and along with that is i think wow look at that mushrooms as medicine so let's open this one up too i know the graphene is getting a little small i have some notes that i took this is all messy but i was listening to a couple of the talks by paul stamets who is a pretty fascinating individual and i took thoughts and i need to make sense of these thoughts but here they are and this is in a state of saying it needs to be developed but wow i took this note way before this one so this is actually perfect so emergence is seen in large groups ants bees birds trees and humans and well really this thing called uh mycelium and that's quite interesting to me so i mean if i were to kind of collect some links for later i could say you know related or relevant relevant and do i have a pulse damage i do not and then i'm just collecting things so so i have on hand things i want to make sure i can pull up a little note is if you are in this nice edit view you're on a mac you can hold down command and then hover over a link and then you can get a preview this guy is fascinating admirable and brilliant okay it looks like i have a high opinion of paul stamets currently and then mushrooms as medicine paul stamets is the clear leader in this field as we see it's over here so i'm thinking out loud emergence is seen in large groups well for one it's just nice to connect it this note was on an island it had zero connections and now i have some connections it's nice to see that i'm not even going to go into the local graph i'll try not to but now we would have some nice local graph connections too and this all stemmed from this view from using a tag and then looking around but let's dive further into this so a little bit of work so far nothing major but pretty happy just to have made some connections so if we go back to the graph view now we see that mushrooms as medicine is connected to emergence is seen in large groups so we've made what would you call that shape i guess it would be a triangle so that's kind of cool so between these two notes and the tag we've triangulated something that's interesting maybe we'll come back to that what else should we explore i mean so many good ones we chronically underestimate how long something will take and so i'm just feeling myself like what am i what is the soft wall to push against to get the ball rolling to you to kind of get in that state of flow great works are flavored by early works okay this is a fairly recent and it took me a while to get to this before i got to this i was working on some pretty cool uh well i haven't looked at that yet but i was watching some pretty interesting things about art history about rodon and how he was heavily influenced by michelangelo and rodon made the thinker that that famous statue but it wasn't his first one and that was fascinating to me so wait he he did a lesser version of his famous work earlier in his life hmm that reminds me of a lot of people including beethoven whose ninth symphony in the um fourth movement that the famous ode to joy na na na na na na na well that actually is something that he developed much earlier in a coral of his and i i think that's so fascinating how you don't have to be perfect right out of the box i don't know that your magnus opus isn't your first work and i wanted to talk about that so here was me thinking about it obviously writing is rewriting but i kind of just was playing with that concept creation is iteration refactor incubate rework don't use remix if writing is rewriting then thinking is rethinking and creating is recreating i don't know how much i believe that but there it is this goes to show that i do believe this many of the best ideas are the ones you've already had you just have to revisit them that's where a tool like this comes in handy and then i keep working on it your great works might be reworked from your earlier works great works are reworked from early work your great works are flavored by early works which takes me here and that's kind of that's kind of where i want to be right now early works developed the complex flavors in the broth of later greater works so at the very least i want to say you know a list of people who fall under this and i already mentioned rodon not robin rodon and beethoven in fact i think they're both in here is verdan um no i guess he's not yet so i'll add him later and then oh mash there was somebody else um well i think picasso is another interesting version of this slightly different but these are at least a few people that i want to start tethering to this concept in my mind because i don't know when you when you look at people's great works sometimes they knock it out of the park when they're really really young but usually it's something that has been flavored and marinated for a while so anyways that was fun now let's go back to the graph view and see where that takes me next so i mean this is it folks this is some note making this is me making sense of things making connections i don't remove the develop tag from either the two notes that i've worked on so far because frankly i'd like to develop them further and they're really not getting in the way they're actually kind of all mixing together in this melting pot that we see in the graph view here so just little bits and pieces i kind of hit a wall mainly because i'm narrating as i go but it's a nice start so i'm i'm kind of happy with that okay where to go next let me think oh i like this one because aliens are fragile what does that even mean i'm about i'm about to get into that oh gosh but i remembered one okay great works are flavored by early works how could i forget because i really have been just he's one of these guys um herman hessa oh looks like i already have a link on him so maybe we open up herman's note i don't have anything there if you did have a template or something you could you know put in that and for the sake of this video i'm going to refrain from going on the internet but i actually would just put a little bit of a you know wiki from google search or duckduckgo i would put in the paragraph and just paste it there just so i have something it's a thing note and it allows me to very quickly and easily connect herman hesse to other things but the thing that i want to make some sense out of right now anyways is um well what do i want to say here's the thing that i've always found fascinating about hess's work is that they're all kind of the same i mean if you're in your early 20s you should definitely read siddhartha and you know it's great for any stage of life but it's funny how hess's work evolves and eventually he wins the nobel prize for his potentially magnus opus the glass bead game and the glass speed game that's interesting okay hold on a second i was just talking about so this hit me i was about to fall asleep one night and i was like oh that makes so much sense castalians are fragile and this is an insight right it's an atomic note it's something that i want to capture so i just quickly captured it and i hit state develop and and you're probably wondering what the heck are castalians what is this even about well it's actually in a hermann hesse work so you know above the wiki this is some good work here and usually i'd like to go online and maybe just get a paragraph to kind of help flesh out a note especially early on but um works and there is siddhartha which i might misspell i i have misspelled but um we'll fix that later siddhartha and then the glass speed game and this i do have as a note already cause there it is the glass b game let's open that up my thoughts glass beads are pillars of thoughts groundedness how to synthesize contemplative versus uh active via activa okay two different modes of being okay so this is this is kind of interesting in the world of the glass bead game it's in some unknown future and this was published in 1943 and dates are important because dates influence the author's mindset of course they do it's the context that this came out in so if you think about what was happening growing up through the first world war and now the second world war in the middle of it and this book is being crafted and put together that obviously influenced hermann hesse okay that's worth keeping in consideration in this world our protagonist joseph connect which um i hope i'm saying that correctly it's kind of one of those double entendres connect is his last name as we see right here he was a powerhouse in castalia he was the best he was the master of the glass speed game and what is the glass speed game well it's a way to connect ideas very very eerily similar to what many of us are currently doing in our knowledge management systems but here's the thing joseph connect is they call magister ludi he's the master of the game but in the real world outside of castalia because i haven't said this yet but castalia it's kind of like in the mountains it's away from everything it is the uh proverbial metaphorical ivory tower so here where we have pure academics and there's a problem with that because when those academics re-enter the real world where we all live their thinking becomes fragile and we we see this all the time i think in what do they call that academies you know this this sort of academic writing that is only that isn't as helpful as it could be and that's why you know the philosophies of of the ancients still have so much impact because they were a little bit more straightforward than some of the stuff that has happened last 100 150 years where it becomes so abstract and obtuse and who are they even talking to and how does this relate to living a good life it gets in the way of things and that's castalia that's playing the glass b game for the sake of the glass speed game and when connect goes into the real world he's fragile i don't want to give away the ending but it's you know he he's a powerhouse in one world he's fragile in the next castalians are fragile i make that connection and it allows me to start making sense of things during this note making session so custodians are fragile i connected it to anti-fragility what else do i want to connect the two just so i can think a little bit so if i'm just going to quickly do some note making uh tidy that up connect powerhouse glass speed game um see i'm just gonna put in some actual links now because i just made this note and then i fell asleep so um what else see i'm just going to go add the connections now it doesn't mean i keep all these links because i want to tidy it up but i'm just kind of throwing them on the the workbench and this note becomes a mini workbench that i can work from and relate it to anti-fragility so obviously if i'm putting in fragile there i have in my mind that i might want to relate it to this so i've already talked out most of my thoughts that i intended to type here so if you think about what i just said for the past few minutes that is what i would type here but because i'm both dictating and and trying to you know work in this system at the same time a little difficult but just rest assured the stuff i'm saying out loud is the stuff that i would be typing right here and that i will be typing after this um recording finishes so let's keep moving on and see where it takes us so with that in mind let's get back to the graph view we still have on our tag for note making that i use which is develop here and i'm looking around and even though castalians are fragile it has a bunch of links so that's worth noting if i were to open up this sidebar we would see that i'm going to do a local graph and just close that out a little bit and we can see the links that custodians are fragile are linking to just want to show that really quickly and i'm looking around what can i make sense of i mean seriously these could not be better placed together i need to make this connection immediately that's why i love the graph view is because this is a perfect example of how i'm going to triangulate two different things you see what i'm looking at here can you can you see the connection tell me if you see a connection here castalians are fragile and there's a concept skin in the game skin in the game i threw in a wiki entry and i left it alone to have incurred well i'm not going to read all that basically the reason oh wow okay this is cool so custodians are fragile why are they fragile why are they fragile oh it's simple they don't have what what what don't they have you got it skin in the game boom they don't have skin in the game they're up there just dilly dallying around in their iv ivory tower they don't have skin in the game get in the real world put yourself at risk if you have risk you got skin in the game and if you're at risk you better believe that that person is going to give you more of themselves whatever whatever the reason is for because they have their own skin in the game castalians are fragile because they don't have skin in the game ah i love it that's that's a valuable insight that is an unexpected idea that has generated value an unexpected crossroads of ideas wow so anyways that's pretty cool let's kind of get to the close on this though there was a point i wanted to make and i know for a fact that i had a note in here so let me try to find it and uh i mean there's just so many fun notes by the way i mean i could just go off i mean we could hop into groundhog day the movie wonderful movie and i've always been wanting to kind of like link it a little bit more specifically to buddhism like i know the links are there it's obvious there's this cycle of a suffering stages of samsara but i kind of want to nail that a little bit more and i haven't had the time just yet so i'll come back to that later i mean this dude schopenhauer he's awesome one of my favorite thinkers i connected uh his will to something that certainly sounds like doc and selfish gene but i wanted to develop that so i have some ideas on that one won't approach that right now but i'm just trying to show you how i'm gliding around looking for things i mean this is a long time to develop in the making plato's cave and how it relates to the matrix and all that stuff but the one i really wanted because i just think this is so interesting the almagest a book from so long ago from 150 a d c e it's a second century greek language mathematical and astronomical treaties by ptolemy and what is so fast okay for one ptolemy's work was excellent it was really ahead of its time and for one thousand years around his ideas about how the planets revolved around the earth was considered canon it was considered fact and that's so weird because for it to be considered fact even at that time you would have had to accept the the non-fact that the moon becomes twice as big and twice as small that's moving like this over the course of a single year and just by observing the moon throughout the course of the year we can realize it doesn't grow like that it stays the same size and that's because it's the same distance away from earth all the time so how come everyone in the world considered it to be fact that's what's worth exploring in this book to me among other things of this collection of ideas and books and so why was that well let's explore and that's where i start opining making opinions about this foundational text it shows our ability to problem solve it shows that if it practically works it's more believable so why was everybody believing so strongly in the almagest it's because it served a practical purpose everything that was written in these treaties a lot of it was about the star positions at the course of um every moment in the year and you could navigate the open seas successfully with these star positions that were mapped out in the almagest and that allowed you to what stay alive so you didn't crash it into the rocks and this is so fascinating why because part of the almagest's theory was that we planet earth are at the center of the universe and everything rotates around us so you can imagine as the evidence starts to refute that and copernicus comes along and says you know actually we and the other planets rotate around the sun how come that wasn't accepted even though copernicus had a lot of proof and even though kepler comes along in galileo and they all contribute all this evidence to something how come there were people that were still resisting this well i mean that's what i was trying to figure out be careful what you believe because your beliefs exert mind control over you okay that's a thought i had even in the face of overwhelming evidence belief finds a way i think really this hits at the fact that things like geocentrism and that stubbornness to to hold on to our old beliefs it shows our vanity our ego and really our narcissism and and i'm not trying to level that claim at anybody but when we consider only having a list view at our disposal as opposed to complementing that list view with i don't know a pretty cool graph if you ask me that's a pretty valuable thing the unmatchable benefit of the graph view has been on full display during this session can you figure out what it was in one word and five syllables triangulation in two words but still five syllables spatial context so let's explore triangulation now in fact i know it happens to be one of the notes i'm working on there it is there's the tag it's basically the process of determining the location of a point by knowing a couple other points and i find triangulation so fascinating because it's i think it's one of the reasons we really like reading the comments about something that we're watching say a youtube video we like seeing the comments on those videos we like seeing when somebody's giving us reactions to the thing that we're watching because if we're watching something and we're getting commentary on the thing that we're watching two points and then we're right here we can now triangulate and make sense of that and that exact thing is happening in the graph view and it's just it's fascinating so we go back to the graph view we see that triangulation happening specifically we actually created a triangle when we connected what was it we connected custodians are fragile with skin in the game we triangulated live during this session and that was like whoa that's that is the value of these that's how we generate value when we have these unexpected interactions isn't that pretty cool and finally spatial context if you're wondering what spatial context is that's how the ancients the the greeks and the romans made these memory palaces in their brain why does that work well we are a species that works well with spaces with understanding how we are in a physical environment and the same things work in our imaginations in our mental environments if we can harness and utilize a sense of spatial context between ideas just like we can between predator and prey between this and that in the physical realm if we can do that i think we can remember better i think we can recall better and i think it allows us to think more laterally where we can be more tangential with our thinking more metaphorical more creative and come up with these amazing valuable insights and that's why the graph view is such a worthy addition to our knowledge management efforts sure we still listen to the radio but once tv came along we had to kind of recalibrate how much we did of each now compare everything that we've just done with only being able to have a linear list of course lists still have value lists aren't going away i love lists but that graph view it enables you to see in ways you really can't see with a list it encourages you to think metaphorically it allows you to dharmak and jalad at tanagra it allows you to casually make references to a star trek episode to make a point and that point is that the graph view encourages you to think laterally and to think metaphorically and that type of thinking is worth strengthening because one it encourages you to develop your unique perspective and two insights are generated at these unexpected intersections and that value can be harnessed in countless ways it can enrich your personal experiences it can make you a wiser person it can unlock a solution to a current problem you're having or it can be a start of a beautiful new business endeavor through note making sessions like this and the linking your thinking workshop my goal is to help strengthen and hone your ability to think fluidly and flexibly and most of all joyfully a healthy world needs citizens who think who question who develop thoughts and ideas over time and build bridges across different domains of personally meaningful insights if you want to know where value is created look to the bridges and you might just find them in the graph view so
