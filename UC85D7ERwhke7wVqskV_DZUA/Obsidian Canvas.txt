I was lost but now I'm fast I was lost but now I'm found but now I'm found yes come on man stuck how do I get out I don't know I just gave up it wasn't going well I guess I lost momentum life happened I lost my train of thought I lost the spark I was overwhelmed life happens man my way out [Music] they who make a better map make better better Mark they who make a better map make a better better Market I was lost but now I'm found I am found I'm found I found my way except this wasn't about Amazing Grace it was about having an amazing space an amazing space to get unstuck when you're overwhelmed what is your amazing space I know you have one is it the park is it walking outside the coffee shop the dinner table pen and paper where do you go to get your thoughts back on track for me it's often an app like obsidian but what if you want to spatially map your thoughts on a virtual whiteboard you can't do that in obsidian can you well now you can introducing canvas but first hi I'm Nick Milo and I'm here to help you do your best thinking more often now why is that important so you can make meaningful stuff that you're actually proud to put your name on so what's stopping you well live it's busy it's full of distractions one second you know clearly what you have to do the next second you're on YouTube wondering how you even got there and it's okay if this happens once or twice a day but what happens when it's once or twice an hour every hour of the day you lose your way you lose your orientation your bearings your Clarity of understanding which way is up that's what we call the mental squeeze point and it can happen when you least expect it so what do you do when it happens do you give up and quit your big thing that effort that you really care about or do you find a way to reorient yourself regather your thoughts and rebuild your momentum That's The Power of a map when you hit a mental squeeze point one of the best reflexes that you can train yourself in is to make a map you can make a map with pen and paper you can make a map with software like obsidian and as of this week you have an entirely new way to do that within obsidian introducing canvas map your thoughts and rebuild your thinking momentum by the end of this video you will not only know the basics of obsidian canvas you'll know how to powerfully use it including to use the secret Maneuvers that make it effortless along with my lingering questions and we're going to finish it with my verdict and takeaways on this exciting thinking tool are you ready let's Dive In [Music] okay here we go we are in as you can see on my screen we've done the intro now we're into the basics let me troll this down and let's walk through the first thing we need to do is get canvas set up first thing we want to do is go hover over here and click on settings and then we're going to go to about and check this out you need to make sure you're at least at version 1.10 now to get this Insider build if you're watching this fresh off the press go ahead and toggle receive Insider builds then check for updates update quit reopen obsidian you'll be good to go so then what happens well now you can hit the command palette remember from previous videos this is command P this is a really important hotkey you can see at the bottom of my screen when I hit command P that's what I'm hitting if you're on a Windows it's going to be control P I'll do my best to say command and control but just know if I'm saying command that's for mac and the equivalent is control on windows so now I'm just going to start I don't know what I'm looking for I'm just going to start typing canvas oh there it is create a new canvas awesome so let's create a new canvas and now we see the symbol here and we can call this test canvas live that's a good enough name and now we'll look through all these different buttons So eventually this test canvas is going to start to look closer to this final product so really fast I just want to show you all the stuff that we'll be going through so it's very exciting let's go a little bit deeper so we got canvas set up we created a new canvas now I'm going to go back to settings one more time because you might forget to hit command P you might forget to hit or like to start typing canvas so let's give it a hotkey of your choice so for that we're going to go to settings hotkeys over here now start typing canvas and if you've upgraded if you have access to Canvas now you can give it a hotkey I hold down three modifiers and then I Hit N so you'll see that show up if I do that now and boom we have a new canvas but I don't really want this one so I'll just delete that one later here we are so now what's next let's talk about moving around the canvas and for that I'll go to this final example here so the first thing I want you to know and these are some really nice Maneuvers to know is just being able to zoom in and out so to do that hold down command or control on Windows and then you can just zoom in and out it's kind of interesting once you zoom out a little bit images go away and we can still just see the colors and the overall shape so if I zoom back in I can start to see things so that's good to know now the other movements that you'll want to be aware of is just how to even create something new so let's do this in the test canvas what I want you to notice is that there are buttons on the upper right and there are buttons at the bottom left so let's hit this which is currently called drag to add card it might change so I'm just going to do that and it creates a card on this canvas so I'll say this is a card and now it exists so what you'll notice at the Four Corners are little pop-ups so if I just click on it nothing happens but if I click hold and drag it will create a new card this 2 is a card Okay so we've just created a connection on this canvas we'll talk about the functionality that currently exists later and the functionality that might exist in the future and we'll cover that before this video is over something else you can do is add media so here's one let's just add my friend mihai chick sent me high this is an image that's already in my Vault so you can see how quickly I can start using images already existing here guess what on Windows and file explorer on Mac and finder open it up find an image you can literally drag and drop it onto this canvas boom now it's part of your obsidian Vault and you can start connecting with it the last one over here is for notes these are existing notes in your idea verse in your ecosystem of knowledge so let's go ahead and click on that and let's add something about sharing how about sharing offers unfair advantages so this is a note it's over here in one of these folders and I've just added it onto the canvas so now you can start thinking about it and connecting it making sense of it maybe that leads to some sort of output maybe it's just helpful for me to make a decision who knows exactly but now we have a pre-existing note that is part of this so we have a card a card and a note now let's see what we should do next making things happen in the canvas so just looking at this we also have the sidebar over here now you can zoom in you can zoom out you can zoom to fit so imagine I'm over here I can hit Zoom to fit and it will fit everything on here let's see what that looks like in a very mature canvas so if I hit Zoom to fit it'll show me everything so we're about to get into some more advanced Maneuvers but first I want you to know that Zoom to fit is also a hotkey shift one so I could be anywhere if I just hit shift one it'll show me everything now it gets better than that though because one that you'll find really powerful after a while is shift 2 which is zoom 2 selection it is extremely Snappy and delightful let me show you what that looks like so if I click on this over here if I hit shift to Boom it shifts over here if I go and I can shift to over here questions and notables it'll shift over here very Snappy guess what you can do more than one note at a time so if I want to show you these settings right now like I do I could just kind of scroll and that works for me but every now and then I might just want to make sure I see it nice and centered so that's what I just did there with those selected I can go ahead and hit shift 2 and it takes me right there something else to know is that there's some grid snapping going on so you can see that as I move this around I am getting some helpful guidance to snap these into helpful alignments something else to be aware of and this works in a lot of different tools that if I hold shift while I start dragging so let's try that one more time if I hold shift while I start dragging it's going to keep me on the X plane or if I'm right in the middle it'll keep me on the Y plane so that's a way to make sure that you're only moving in One Direction I can hit undo and that will move me back a couple hotkey notes that I find interesting is that canvas doesn't have the global undo and redo because that's working at a note level so that's why we have to use these buttons to undo and redo things okay it's time for the next section [Music] and we're jumping into secret Maneuvers this is what I'm most excited to show you because with any new tool if you know just the basic secret Maneuvers that no one really talks about it unlocks the tool for you and all of a sudden you say to yourself wow now I know how to use a hammer now I know how to use a Phillips screwdriver in this case let's talk about zooming in and out scrolling horizontally duplicating and just basically moving around let's go back to this big canvas how do I see everything again you tell me oh that's right it's shift what is it shift one okay now we see everything I need to zoom in a little bit though so how am I doing this well let's go to secret Maneuvers and find out these are the secret Maneuvers to supercharge your canvas experience the first one to know is being able to zoom in and out so on Mac I'm going to hold command down and then use the mouse scroll wheel to scroll around I use this all the time this is this is where it's at you combine this with the next one scroll horizontally hold down shift and then scroll with the scroll wheel that's going to move you left and right okay this works in Google Sheets this works in a lot of different apps these are the secret Maneuvers that work in all sorts of universal applications and if you get comfortable with them when you try out something new you'll be surprised to recognize that if it's well designed you can probably do these things already and so what you learn here can benefit you in countless situations yet to occur so now let's just combine these two and see how that feels this is how I always navigate I'm always thinking about having a hand on a thumb on the command control and I'm zooming this way and then if I want to move over to the right I hold down shift and then I use that scroll wheel and then I shift over this way I go over here I zoom in I zoom in over here I scroll I zoom in and out beautiful stuff okay now depending on how you use things you can move around a different way you could hold down space you can see I have space held down right now that I can click and drag so that's another way to move around it's worth knowing and one that was so beautiful when I found out that obsidian the developers already have this in in canvas right now is duplicate so let's say I really like how this is designed if you hold down option alt on Windows option then click and drag and boom you have a duplicate I use this all the time so these are the secret Maneuvers that will really unlock this application for you so just so you know we've currently covered the settings which are a lot of the basics and we've covered the secret Maneuvers so what's next hey if you're excited about obsidian canvas let me know by hitting the like button and even better give me a comment let me know how you plan to use it [Music] okay next up is the meat and potatoes this is the stuff that I think you'll really enjoy the power moves using internal images external images cards URLs of any type those are links anything that has a link let's dive in let's go back to this canvas over here so now where are we going let's check out using cards so remember this little button over here creates cards once you have it created it works just like you'd expect the files to work if you want to make something bold you can go ahead and hit command B just like in Microsoft Word it'll give you some markdown and then you can say this is bold and then go on and say this is important because and who knows now you can do a quick resize and then put that wherever let's say I want a link here what am I what am I going to do I'm going to click and drag to the new card and it's connected and what if I want to click this card connect it to that card and now we have some magical things happening so Snappy I can just move this thing around beautiful what if I want to duplicate it what do I hold down on a Mac I hold down option and I duplicate on Windows it's alt I will delete that for now let's check this out so this is a card a card isn't a note that means it's not its own file that means it only exists in this canvas that's worth noting and we'll talk more about this near the very end one thing I want you to know is that you can convert this to a file which means it's a note then you can convert it to a note so I really don't want to do this but let's just see what happens here so I'll say using cards in obsidian canvas okay and then I'll hit done now look at that now it's a new note it's a new note it's a file on my computer I can find this file I can do anything with it because now it's a markdown file so let's move on though you can upgrade a card to a note just like you saw so I'm one step ahead of myself hey we can place existing images like you saw in the test canvas over here what else can we do well after I place that image I said let's that reminds me of flow you know what else does mihai remind me of I have other notes on Flow so this is where you start brainstorming you start making your map of content in this really fluid manner so in this case I'm going to hit command o which is going to show all my notes you could also click this button over here just remember that so you can click that button and then I'm going to hit flow I got other things on Flow so why not the flow map and now I have this nice little flow map in here and I don't want it to be that big so I'll just put it over here and then again I'll just connect mihai to that kind of cool right it makes sense it's so nice to see this now we can also have external images So I placed a new image and I have one prepared for us right now so there's something that I recently um found from family members Grandma Doris's cinnamon rolls this is part of the recipe this is what you can do with Knowledge Management when you have an ecosystem where you can find those things that just fill your heart so you can go ahead and throw in Grandma Doris's cinnamon rolls and here's part of the recipe I have more for those who are interested but this is part of the recipe so it doesn't make sense in this canvas but you can just see how it was just a file over here on my computer and now it's over here in my canvas and I can think with it I can connect it can make the magic happen now let's go even further let's talk about URLs and anything with the link now we're talking about other power moves you can copy and paste URLs or anything so let's say you use the application things over in things I have this note telling me to try out canvas so I can go over here and copy the link did you know you could do this you can copy the link then just anywhere in this canvas I'm just going to paste and now I have the link here I can connect it which is just the same as this so what do I do with this it looks kind of strange it doesn't matter all I have to do is double click and then hold down command and click boom opens up things and you can do this with anything that has a link that means the Calendar app anything online good example of that are the release notes for this I just found that online and I just grabbed the link from the internet dragged and dropped it right here images from the internet this is nuts you can just add anything let me show you what I'm talking about so let's open up Safari and I did a search for ideaverse and linking your thinking I don't like the results I'll go to images I do like this let me right click and Open Image new tab what if I could just drag and drop this onto the canvas you can there it is there it is and then of course you want to resize it and pretty cool so now I'll shift that over here and that's also an image so I'll just go and connect it very nice very nice to see that is there anything else what about linkingyourthinking.com URL check this out click drag drop it's here it's it's kind of cool it's the actual website I'm on this website looking at it um pretty wild pretty wild I think you can zoom in you can actually read this I'm really blown away at how this sort of stuff works so you can do a lot with these power moves and that takes us to our next section as we start to wrap this up [Applause] let's go into lingering questions let me twirl this one down these are a few that we're going to look at how big is the canvas how do backlinks work is the canvas markdown we know that markdown allows us to Future proof our knowledge so is the canvas helpful with future proofing what is my current verdict on that and then what happens to the cards that you just add to the canvas that are not their own files let's dive into each of those questions right now and so if you go over here to the questions this is that giant canvas so you know what I'll do I'll highlight everything I'll hit shift two and now it's all right here is the canvas markdown no it's a format known as Json I'm not this is where it's beyond me it gets stored as a text node with the text field so what happens to these cards that exist nowhere else well they get stored as a text node with a text field okay that was a repeat but what does this mean it means that it's not marked down so the developers are people that I trust and I know they're working on the best ways to improve what we're looking at can I say definitively that canvas notes are future proofed um not definitively not today not just yet give it one month give it two months three months and I think the answer will become a yes I don't know how they're going to do it but I have confidence that they will next how big is the canvas so this is something that I saw from them but if you are familiar with tools like Microsoft OneNote you'll love the canvas and what I've noticed is as you put on more images it seems to grow so we can kind of test this out just to kind of see what happens I'm kind of curious myself and now it's grown now it's grown substantially wow how can we Zoom to fit everything there's a magical hotkey and it's also right here shift one let's hit that and it looks like there comes a point where it can't see all the stuff so that's interesting it starts to try to balance the canvas out again I bet you that's fixed in a week or two what else let's go back to this question section shift two and I'm back finally backlinks this is where people are the most concerned especially the Nerds the technical people the ones who really want to make sure that this checks off all the technical boxes currently backlinks only work for the canvas itself that means none of these notes even though it looks like they have connections currently today none of them have connections this may change next week none of these are actually links there's no this is just a card it's not a note and these are just cards so there are no backlinks the only backlink is between this note this canvas that we're looking at and let's say I can link this to this one over here which I've done so I've given a note at the top and if I click on this it opens back up to the canvas so I've created that sort of backlink and we can I think we can see that so in this canvas note we can see that it is linked in my other note right here so it's working at that highest of levels currently the backlinks do not work within the canvas itself meaning that even for the notes that I've dropped in that are already have pre-existing this image is not backlinked to flow or vice versa or the flow map this will change over time it's just not there right now so I kind of consider it a Much Ado About Nothing we don't want to judge things too soon and in fact that leads me to a very important caveat message can this just just came out to insiders the majority of users by my calculations over 200 000 of you you still don't have access as of this recording that means that canvas is raw it's new and that means it's absurd to harshly judge the work in progress can you imagine someone walking up behind Michelangelo as he's sculpting the David scoffing out loud and dismissing it as missing features I don't see his abs are those really what you call eyeballs where is he even looking why are his hands so big it's a bit absurd isn't it it's like harshly judging the raw dough for cinnamon rolls and declaring that you won't eat them before they even go into the oven over the last two and a half years one thing is clear don't bet against the obsidian developers they know what they're doing [Music] time for the takeaways we can twirl them down here but let's have more fun looking in the canvas itself so if I zoom out we're looking at the same Mega map this Mega canvas and we're going down to takeaways the first one is the canvas might remind you a little bit of a cool tool like the global graph and say what you will about the graph view there are people who don't know how to use it and they assume that means it's unusable obsidian canvas really gets the chef's kiss it's just really amazing and why it's so amazing is because it allows us to use our spatial abilities we as humans we just get we just get Space we navigate this way naturally and so the canvas allows us to truly understand and utilize maps of content which This truly is here and as a reminder what a map of content is it is an Moc a cluster of information and it Maps things in context with other things practically you can use mocs for three big things gather develop navigate ideas you can read the rest on your own time the last takeaway is this is just the first Insider version we don't know exactly what the future will bring but most likely backlink functionality linking functionality is going to expand Beyond this initial version we might have things like collapsible notes maybe that'll be pretty cool so I can click a button here and all the takeaways collapse back inside of it and maybe some basic shapes so we can have circles and lines and other things the big takeaways for me is that you can use obsidian canvas to make sense of something you care about something that the canvas does is it helps me be able to say I really know my stuff I can come back to this canvas map of content and remind myself of all the cool ways that this thing works and you can apply this to anything that you want to learn that you want to improve at that you want to develop the ideas around make the decisions on if you you want to create something guess what I'm 80 done if I want to share this this video is the proof of that this canvas map is the proof of that this is this is it this is the script this is what I'm using it's 80 done after I made this I now have a new thinking tool you're carrying around with your thinking toolbox guess what canvas is a new thinking tool the advantages of using canvas over a regular mind mapping software is that it integrates and links with the rest of your knowledge ecosystem your personal ideiverse the way that you make sense of the world and create value out of the things that you encounter not only that but a year from now maybe I don't use canvas I forget everything about it I jump into this note and I'm immediately reminding future me how it all works and last it sure was fun this is fun it's just fun to think this way oh little extra that I didn't show you is if you go over here to the file explorer take any note drag and drop and boom it's there I saved the best for last that's one that you should probably use a lot if you use the file explorer I typically have it closed so even though it looks really cool I typically don't do that guess what else is awesome you can drag and drop from within so if I click on this once then I can drag and drop a link and boom what did I just do here's idea emergence that I just pulled out from here that's amazing and then can say you know it points to this over here so there's so much that you can do with obsidian canvas I really hope this got you excited on to the conclusion [Music] having a clear and organized map of your thoughts can greatly improve your ability to think make decisions and generate insights you can do this on paper I love using paper but you can't easily move your ideas around you can't move that bubble you can't link it to the rest of your knowledge ecosystem but you can using a tool like obsidian this helps future you quickly remember and understand obsidian's new canvas view allows you to map out your ideas at close to the speed of thought the big takeaway is this those who make a better map make a better mark what map will you be making hey if you want to learn the basics of obsidian and take your thinking game to the next level check out obsidian flight school a one-of-a-kind immersive training experience with over 100 exclusive videos and trainings to get you using obsidian as close to the speed of your thoughts as humanly possible but until next time stay connected [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
