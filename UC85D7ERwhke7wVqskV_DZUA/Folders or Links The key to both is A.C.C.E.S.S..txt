in humanity's knowledge management efforts the 
ongoing battle is always between order and chaos   the most common part of that battlefield is 
between knowledge and action on the side of   knowledge we want to make sense of the world 
so we can live a life that we can be proud of   in that sense we are the philosophers but then 
on the other side of action we want to get things   done so we can get the things that we want on 
this side too much time thinking and we never   actually move in the world our thoughts and our 
bodies become fragile the thoughts become fragile   because they're never tested against reality and 
yet too much time striving and we easily lose   track of what matters our hearts and souls become 
fragile as the amount of information we consume   daily has exploded exponentially it has opened 
up a new battlefield between folders and links   now all these battles should not be to the 
death no they should be tensions that we balance   so how do we balance these ongoing tensions in 
our efforts to manage knowledge in the digital age   what if there was a way to balance the efficient 
order of folders with the creative chaos of links   what if there was a way to balance our love 
of wisdom with our desire for progress well   i'm excited to offer one possible solution called 
access a folder structure built from the ground up   to work with folders and links together not 
as an afterthought and not as a retro fit   but as a fundamental part of the design process 
i believe the access folder structure will   get you closer to having a holistic system to 
manage knowledge and action in the digital age   but first let's look at how we got 
here starting with microsoft word   okay check out this map before i show you where 
microsoft word is on it let's talk about what   we're looking at this is the emphasis of knowledge 
management systems so those two tensions that we   were talking about between knowledge and action 
that's where they are on the map check them out   knowledge is at the top of the y-axis and then 
action is at the bottom and this is a tension   that we have to manage and then same thing with 
the x-axis over on the left we see folders over on   the right we see links this is another tension in 
the modern digital age that we're trying to figure   out how to manage and when it comes to knowledge 
and action that management that tension that   we felt it has has gone up for as long as we've 
possibly been alive as homo sapiens so it's really   interesting to check out that tension in the 
digital age and how that relates to folders and   links so let's hop in number one microsoft word 
came on the scene and think about what microsoft   word is doing it is a folder-based document 
system and it's mainly to manage knowledge   that's the intention behind it not many people are 
using microsoft word to get things done they're   not using microsoft word to link out to a million 
different documents that's just not what happens   so word goes up here what's next wikipedia so at 
the start of the 21st century wikipedia bursts   onto the scene and what do we have with it we have 
online links and what is wikipedia trying to do   manage knowledge so it is sort of in in some 
ways it's the opposite of microsoft word it's not   personal it's public it's all about knowledge just 
like word except instead of folders it is relying   on links are we getting a sense of how the map 
is working let's keep going then something else   that was coming onto the scene around the same 
window of time was gtd which stands for getting   things done the seminal work by david allen to 
help people manage information for the purposes   of getting things done so guess what that's all 
about action so we can see that gtd is far down   here on action now as far as folders versus 
links the system itself is a little bit more   structured towards folders but that doesn't mean 
that some people haven't tried to retrofit it to   work with tags and links and other things so for 
our purposes gtd is right here on the map of where   knowledge management systems are emphasizing their 
importance now next up we have the zeddle casting   coming on the scene very strong in the past decade 
where does that land up on our map and we can see   zetta locastin is all about the link it is all 
about the links that is the emphasis when you're   connecting ideas together in a zl cast in now you 
can see though the cloud covers a little bit of   knowledge and a little bit of action and it's kind 
of in between both but it's definitely a little   bit more on the knowledge side although when you 
are using the zettocast in for outputs you get a   little bit more of that action-oriented side of 
things okay and then we had a splash of three   different systems all around the same time and 
that would be johnnydecimal the parasystem and ppv   i don't have time to go into all the details here 
but i'll say johnnydecimal is very folder oriented   and it's a little bit more about knowledge 
although you can still do some action with it   para is in many ways the spiritual successor of 
gtd uh allowing us to take those concepts and   apply them and not just for action-based stuff but 
also for knowledge based stuff but it is designed   it was designed to work with folders doesn't mean 
that it can't be retrofitted but that's definitely   where the emphasis was and then we have ppv i'll 
have links to all these below in the description   ppv is something that works with notion and 
databases databases are really hard to show   on this map but they are definitely closer 
to links and the dynamic aspects of linking   information than they are to folders so i put ppv 
here and really it's both in action and you can't   tell with the clouds here but it's going 
all the way up to knowledge as well   what are we missing we are missing something 
to unify these concepts and that is access   the folder structure and that's what i'm about 
to introduce to you the access folder structure   balances knowledge and action folders and links 
into a dynamic hybrid system that was designed   from the ground up to give you the best of all of 
these worlds and to manage these ongoing tensions   in knowledge management okay i hope that got you 
thinking about what is actually in the access   folder structure and i just want to say this 
this map is meant to stimulate thought into what   is actually going on with knowledge management in 
the digital age if you are better informed to how   all these different systems are working then 
you'll know the ones that will work best for   you and for what you are trying to accomplish so 
without further ado let's jump into access itself   introducing access a folder structure for 
easy access to your world of knowledge   what does the folder structure look like here we 
go you have a for atlas c for calendar c for cards   e for extra s for sources and s for spaces let's 
dive into each one so you can see how it applies   number one atlas when you work with linked 
knowledge you need something new you need higher   order notes what do those notes look like they 
are maps of content there are dashboards overviews   logs data scopes these type of notes that sit 
on top of the rest of your notes and give you a   bird's eye view into all of your knowledge that is 
your map of maps that is your atlas what does it   help you do helps you gather develop and navigate 
your ideas successfully and what lives here maps   to your world of knowledge going to the next one 
calendar it turns out when we remember things   we use location maps but we also use time and the 
way that we use time with knowledge management is   through the calendar folder and the notes we save 
here it helps us log track and review what matters   what lives here is your time-based information 
so some examples that you'll see are daily notes   meetings plans reviews and journals the next 
folder cards now cards might sound kind of strange   but in the world of linked notes when you're 
trying to save ideas into their own container   of thought a note you'll have a lot of different 
cards and what cards allow you to do is just   a way to say note but it gives 
it a little bit more flexibility   cards help you build and connect your ideas so 
what goes in ideas insights and other things   what are some examples ideas things you could 
have a people cards folder section subfolder   concepts statements if you are a cook recipes if 
you're into exercise something with a physical   exercises you can make any sort of card subfolder 
as you need to but all these bits of knowledge   that you gather over your lifetime they go into 
the cards folder next up extras extras covers   everything in between it helps you keep your 
support material handy what goes in support   material like attachments graphics images manuals 
templates hand drawings whatever it is extras can   handle that next up we have sources this helps you 
build your external library of ideas so something   that we're coming to terms with in the digital age 
is that there's this explosion of knowledge and   there's also what we think about internally and we 
don't want to confuse the two all the time so when   we look at cards that's more of our place where 
we're creating our own little nuggets of knowledge   that we can link to each other effectively but 
then in sources we can save and keep outside   sources and make sure that they're organized in 
a way that we can find quickly through folders   just as easily as we can find through links so 
the things that you encounter are what go in here   and some examples that you encounter that 
are sources are articles books podcasts   research papers courses talks movies and 
tv shows that you want to take notes on and   videos and much more and last i'm very excited 
for this one spaces what are spaces spaces are any   big spaces in your life and you should probably 
have two maybe three spaces at any given time   in your life so you're always going to have your 
life space the stuff that you have to take care   of in your personal life and you'll also have 
one that's work now depending on how ambitious   rambunctious or how much time you have you might 
also have a third space you could call that your   hobby space maybe it's something else maybe it's 
your side hustle who knows so you'll at least have   two spaces and in each space in your life in this 
folder structure you deploy maps and so that is m   a p s maps so within the life folder you have four 
subfolders for your maps of content those are mocs   areas projects and support notes we're going 
to cover this in depth in the next section so   you can see how it actually tangibly can work for 
you so remember the tension we were talking about   between folders and links spaces and maps are part 
of that solution because anytime you have a new   space in your life all you have to do is deploy a 
new set of maps so if you have one for hobbies you   just deploy a new set of maps and you're off to 
the races and that is where you're managing your   actions so look at the access folder structure 
that vertical structure and do you remember that   on our map we had knowledge at the top and action 
at the bottom and if you look at the access folder   structure it is mimicking that sense our knowledge 
comes when we have our higher order maps and our   dashboards we take some daily notes we have 
our knowledge cards and goes all the way to   the bottom two spaces and in spaces that is where 
all the action happens knowledge to action that is   the access folder structure so to dive deeper 
into the access folder structure i'm sharing   two lessons from the light kit tutorial videos 
the light kit is a free downloadable starter   kit to get you exploring ways to manage your 
digital notes it's been downloaded over 33 000   times probably more by the time you watch this 
and the download link is in the description below   try it out experiment learn by doing and discover 
the power of linking your thinking okay and now   to the light kit version of nick to show 
you the access folder structure in action   take it away nick let's introduce access 
what is access is an acronym that stands   for atlas calendar cards extras sources and 
spaces access is the solution to tension   that has been coming in three different dimensions 
when it comes to knowledge management the first   tension is between knowledge itself and action 
so what are you using your knowledge for   well it's going to be some mixture of these two 
things knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself   which i find is a worthy pursuit but often 
we also want to accomplish things in the real   world that lead to real outcomes real results and 
allows us to survive in a world where you have to   provide value and get compensated for it 
so how do we balance the tension between   ideas and projects that's what's happening here 
what's another tension folders versus links   we've had folders forever we're relatively 
new with links how do we manage that tension   and then the third tension that we're trying to 
manage is structure which folders provide a lot   of versus the chaos which sometimes we can feel 
in a environment completely filled with links   the intention around the access folder structure 
is that we get the best of all these worlds we can   manage knowledge just as effectively as action 
we can use folders and the strengths that they   provide as well as links and the strengths that 
they provide we can have both structure when we   want it and the chaos because the chaos is where 
some of that beautiful bottom-up energy comes from   where we start generating really unique insights 
and we can really tap into our creative selves   how does that accomplish it well let's kind 
of twirl these down the first place is called   encounters because generally speaking we encounter 
things and then we express ourselves in between   we do something called thinking but mainly 
it's encountering and expressing and that's a   feedback loop and we just go back and forth 
between those two things so the first folder   after we encounter something this is where we can 
put new ideas by the way and then we have a place   to access some of those maps of content some of 
them are more of the data scopes like this essay   so this only has one link home but it has 
all these saved searches this essay note is   actually pulling content in a bunch of queries 
saved searches data scopes all the same thing   and we can see different essays so that's 
pretty interesting what else scopes these are   very specific data scopes and we looked at a few 
already there are some that i'll let you discover   and so the atlas folder is your top down 
view it's very important it's up high too   in the folder structure to to allow you to have 
that visual sense that we're starting up high   and then we're going down into something 
for those knowledge management enthusiasts   we cannot downplay the importance of time-based 
understanding temporal context how else can i   say this well just daily notes we understand 
and we can remember things through when they   happened that was when i was in high 
school that was when i was a little kid   that was when i lived in this town and from that 
we can start to understand when we had an idea and   we can tether knowledge that way so that happens 
in the calendar i won't go into that for now   cards cards is the great catch-all this is where 
your zettles go if you're familiar with that term   these are where your atomic notes go and so much 
more so you can have people cards you could have   concept cards you could really really expand 
that into all sorts of sub-folders or you don't   have to have any sub-folders that's the beauty of 
links it just depends how many folders you want   what is the appropriate amount of structure for 
you because in this digital age of linked notes   folders can still serve structuring purposes but 
we still have the freedom to whenever we want make   a link so we get the best of both worlds extras 
is where the extra stuff goes media templates pdfs   files documents sources is where all that outside 
stuff goes the outside world sources can go here   i could twirl down books and see a few books 
here i encourage you to explore all of these   then we have spaces very excited for spaces before 
i go into spaces i want to make sure i've covered   everything here i always want to reiterate that 
access what separates the access folder structure   from a standard folder setup is that it's this 
unique hybrid that takes into account links into   a folder system it's a it's a beautiful thing i'm 
very excited to to have more people understand   that we can have the best of both worlds it's 
a folder-based pcam framework that also uses   link based maps of content so we can 
dynamically connect notes across folders   whoa that just blows my mind so that is the 
access folder structure i would like you to   spend some time twirling these things down seeing 
all sorts of hidden gems you don't need folders   you can get by without but i find that i do 
like a few and i think you might be the same way   yes links are exciting but we don't have 
to throw the baby out with the bathwater   with that in mind i want to talk about very next 
lesson the next lesson is about managing projects   in a link based system using the spaces 
folder and more specifically how we can deploy   maps and that is for our final lesson 
very excited to see you in that one   because we're going to see how we can manage 
action in the same area in the same pkm system   as knowledge and we are introducing spaces so 
if i twirl down the spaces folder i'm going to   make this even bigger you can see that there are 
two spaces within this folder life and work now   for me work i'd use an acronym called lyt for 
linking your thinking but what do you do for   work can you use it as an acronym there was a 
time where i had three spaces all at once i had   my life space we all had that one i also had 
my entertainment workspace when i was editing   and then i also had this one that was starting 
to become something the linking your thinking   space so you can have hobby spaces with 
workspaces with life spaces and that's kind   of the flexibility the beauty of a space 
you might be asking yourself right now   well is a space just an area is it just like 
a an area for projects what is a space exactly   well they're for any big area in your life 
and so i want to talk about that a little bit   because when i twirl one down i think it'll make 
a little bit more sense so i'm going to twirl down   the life space and here you can see how in each 
space we deploy maps and maps is an acronym   for mlcs areas projects and support notes so why 
not go back to our favorite note home note i want   you to see something here in our home note there's 
a project section so i can click on projects or i   can plan and prioritize my work life which is the 
light space for me or i can plan and prioritize   my personal life now let's jump into the life 
my life space and here's what i want you to see   a p s maps this allows me a way to not just have 
areas to not just have projects but to incorporate   link-based knowledge and how do we do that with 
mlcs so this is the hybrid system this is how   we combine folders with links it's a very elegant 
very simple solution so a good example this is you   can see my mlcs can take me to finances they can 
take me to health and then when i want to go into   areas i can scroll back scroll down a little bit 
further and jump into areas to plan and review   to work on financial notes and to work on health 
related notes now these are not notes i'm going   to be showing you but you can see what you can do 
here and then last we can go and jump into my life   projects now i also don't have this one available 
to you but you can see what that looks like   i also give you a few other ideas that you can 
play around with for life purposes this won't   mean much to you it means a lot to people who go 
through the light workshop but let's check out   the last one which is going to be the light space 
kit so now if you are managing some sort of small   business these are maybe some areas that you might 
consider first you might want some maps of content   for big areas content creation for whatever the 
the big thing is that you do for community related   efforts team management technical administration 
and the financials for the business these are   just some basic things you might have some other 
ones what about areas well things related to the   light kit i can put notes in a specific area 
same thing with the workshop now let's see   what that actually looks like i don't know how 
much i should actually show everyone here but   the one i do show is the light notes newsletter 
i think i have a few examples in here   so it's kind of funny because i have some email 
autoresponders here saying thank you for opting   in and things like that but amongst all of that 
stuff we also have the light notes themselves and   they're all contained in a single folder and i can 
move that folder around if i wanted to and where   does that folder live within spaces within the 
workspace and with the areas within the workspace   pretty cool if you ask me and we can have that for 
and i do for my flight school thing for my light   kit workshops light events those are my areas 
and then we also have projects i don't include   this in the light kit but i think you can kind of 
get the idea about what would go into projects so   that is the beauty now if we go all the way back 
let me twirl this one closed again i just want you   to know what's possible here yeah project just an 
example folder here nothing's inside let's close   spaces and there we go back to the walkthrough 
for every space that's big and important and   distinct in your life all you have to do is deploy 
maps mocs areas projects and support notes and it   works beautifully as a hybrid system between 
folders and links and it ties it all together order versus chaos that's our constant tension 
even since ancient times these two forces stood   at odds with each other apollo versus dionysus the 
tension is at the heart of comedy and tragedy and   often times the difference is razor thin the 
crease of a smile the glint in the eye if we   see it we laugh if we don't we cry and if the 
tension is ever so right we might even do both   this same tension exists throughout our living 
days it's the tension between streets paved on   a grid and untamed vines there's no right way it's 
the balance that we seek and this tension doesn't   just exist in the real physical world it also 
exists in the world of ideas since before the days   hamlet experienced paralysis by analysis we 
have always had the same troubles of balancing   knowledge and action and it's even worse in 
the digital age and now that the common person   you and i have the ability to digitally link 
ideas together another plane of tension has   opened up between folders and links and that's why 
when it comes to managing your digital knowledge   the access folder structure finds the balance so 
give it a try it's actually meant to be broken and   reshaped by you because one of the fundamental 
truths of pkm personal knowledge management is   that it's personal i wish you good fortune in your 
efforts to manage the things that matter to you   i truly hope to help you get a grip on managing 
the information that is important to you   because the world of information is crazy but 
managing things that resonate with you can be fun   and when it is suddenly the world is so much more 
interesting so if you haven't already download the   free light kit below open it up as a new vault in 
obsidian and use it as a playground to run around   in experiment learn by doing and see what works
