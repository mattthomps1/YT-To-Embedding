[Music] hey everyone welcome to the lighthouse my guest today is joe dicastro as you can see on screen he is the creator of this visualization that we're looking at that looks at the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy i'm really excited to dig into this with joe so joe like how are you doing overall it's fun talking with you beforehand and just kind of getting some insights into this so what are we looking at so what we're looking at right now is we're looking at the article graph for the bertrand russell article from the sep for those here who might not know of it the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy is really one of the web's great resources for philosophy it's every article that they publish there it's trying to be the canonical article about that topic there's an editorial each article has a lit review each article really is just the canonical version of it but the thing about the step is it's hard to navigate you know it's a use case is to be the resource so they're not worrying about navigation about being able to explore the entire domain resource so i built this site as a way to help users explore the site both from a research point of view but also just a really fun way to explore this incredible encyclopedia yeah and it's definitely that and now i really want to dive in a little bit more to the why but really curious why are we starting on bertrand russell out of all places besides that it looks really cool i tend to start with the russell graph because i know a little bit about russell and it's kind of easier for me to riff on the different features that are available in my application by starting on the russell graph now we could go anywhere we'll see the other version there's two main graphs there's the article graph and then there's the domain graphs but we always start or i always start when i'm training someone with a particular article and i just tend to like to start with russell it's a big pretty but it also allows me to talk about some of the different features that aren't quite apparent when you first look at it but show the real power of visualizing sep i think one of the other reasons i wanted to have you on is selfishly because i was like well i want to learn from joe himself you know how you navigate this and what the little tips and tricks are to to really fly around i mean i sometimes i get goosebumps and i just do looking at all these different things and i think that's like to your point i didn't quite realize that part of the why of you know why you created this one of the reasons i think there are some other passionate reasons that we're going to get into but some of the practical reasons is just to really help with the navigation of as you put it the canonical versions of a lot of these topics thinkers domains and whatnot where are we going where would we go from here so in some sense i kind of want to start with i'm going to uh open up the bertrand russell article from the sep itself so that people can have a sense of what makes visualizing sep so cool so if we go to when you're on this graph here you can always get into the original article from stanford from inside the graph so you come up here to to this article details button and right over here you have the step link so if i open that up now we're gonna go into the encyclopedia itself so if i was on the encyclopedia and i wanted to know about russell you know i could go and i could search the archive here for bertrand russell now we're already there so it would show you this article but it's huge you know it is a really really long intense article so you don't understand the context in which russell was performing his work you can learn about russell and his innovations and the time period but you can't actually get a sense of what else was going on how russell relates to other philosophers other domains and schools of thought so to come back to visualizing sep the reason why i did this is that you go you want to look about russell so you have our interface here you get the super tiny over here just quick introduction depending on its 300 characters maybe 500 characters but then you'll have now this article domains and what this is is this is the domains of philosophy in which russell was working now thinker isn't a domain that was my taxonomy just to link philosophers but russell is known for really three major forms of philosophy his work in logic his work in philosophy of mathematics his work in metaphysics so this here tells you that and then the graph is showing you every article in the entire encyclopedia that links to bertrand russell in some way this could be a bi-directional link russell could link to the article in the article could link back to russell it could be the articles that link from the russell article to other ones or it could be the articles that link into and what this is showing you and what's interesting about this is it's providing the context and i think that's one of the things that makes visualizing sep really interesting your standard search engine is going to return a single scalar article it might show you other articles that might fit that same search term but it's not showing you the context and this is what visualizing sep is doing so it's showing you the context that russell's working in there are 77 articles which you can see here on this right side here this is showing you the primary domain the main thrust through the main category that each article was in and it's showing you how many and each of these categories has a color representation now it's the same throughout the site so epistemology is always going to be a light yellow ethics is this orangy pink and then down here this is going to show you the directional links so at first this is cool but you can really deep dive and once you mouse over things now you can focus on this particular thing that you're looking at so you wanted to see all the outgoing links so these are the 13 links that the russell article links to these are the 46 links that link into russell same thing is up here with the primary domains you want to see what are the philosophers that russell links to well now we're just focusing on this what's the philosophy of mathematics articles so you can just continually update your focus points and i think a really beautiful way to be able to kind of deep dive into some of this stuff here the other thing you can do is you mouse over you mouse off so you lose that but if you single click on an article now this stays and you can say now i'm just going to look at the articles these are the articles on metaphysics and each time you mouse over one of the articles in the graph you're going to get on the left sidebar a quick update for what it is and you can then just get a good sense of okay these are the different articles in metaphysics but now i want to look at epistemology and i can continually update the graph and completely explore the different articles that link to it that's one way of doing it the coolest thing i think that this graph does though is when you're looking at the articles themselves you have this big graph and when you mouse over one of these articles then you're going to see some of them disappear and some of them don't and you'll you'll see that there there are these dashed lines going from the article that you've presently moused over to other articles what this is showing you is this is showing you the subset relations within the article graph itself so this article on sense data that's an article that russell links to but these are the articles that stay active these also link from sense data so now you have this relationship between sense data also links to these articles that share some conceptual space with russell itself if you wanted to say all right i know russell and wickenstein are they're linked for tons of reasons and you want to have some sense of that so you can come down here to wickenshine and now you're seeing all of these articles share links between the wickenstein main article and the russell article because this is the context that we're exploring and how russell was working and saying here you you can freeze this graph and then get a better sense if you want to see these articles or you can just unfreeze it again a single click will freeze the graph and then a single click again on the frozen node unfreeze the graph and they're back to the very beginning and you can just keep exploring all of these different things one other thing that you can see in here is up here in the default mode of the graph you have this list of articles featured on the right and what this does is this gives you an alphabetical listing of every article on the graph itself so when you can click that heading and now you have an alphabetical listing the radial graph is isn't alphabetical and i did that because i wanted to have jarring spelling differences so that you didn't get too comfortable in one particular way of going okay i'm going around the graph clockwise abc i really wanted to spur some sense of play but if you want to have that alphabetical list then you can just come over here to the list of articles and you can still mouse over and get the same subset relations but if you don't want to see that then you just double click that you single click that again that gets hidden and now you can look at the just domain list and the direction list another quick thing that you can do is that when you come over over here to the articles details button now every article you can click the article details button there but you can also just hold down your shift key and then as you mouse over any one graph you can then pull up the article details for that one graph and when you do that it immediately expands over here that alphabetical list because now you can't see the graph itself but you still want to know how these articles relate to each other and then when you close yeah can you do that one one more time just because i was a little slow so basically you're holding down shift yes so you can click the article details did this button here but instead of having to do that if you hold down the shift key and as you mouse over any of these articles you can bring up the article details data for that particular article and when you do that the on the right hand side the list of articles appear so that you can then figure out if you want to look at which other articles you want to look at if you're in the graph you single click again and it closes it down and so that list of articles that appears coincides with whatever pops up on the screen so yes so the that makes sense the and and when you when you freeze a graph okay now you only have these what eight ten graphs ten nodes frozen when you come back to the list of articles it's going to dim those that are also hidden so now you can just go back and see see from from this view if you wanted that when you're looking at the graph it's not really helpful to be able to see it because now you're just duplicating the information there but when you're in that article details and you can't see the graph but you also know that anything that has a full opacity title it's sharing a link it's part of the context in which the details that you're looking at how that also relates to the russell graph very nice that was my super quick overview of the article graph do you have questions about that yeah well i definitely do as john said in the in the chat breathless and speechless i mean what you said at the top really and i want to continue to hammer that point home it's really all about context and i'm glad you start with bertrand russell because he's somebody that i've looked at and i'm like everyone talks about burch and russell but i'm not quite sure what he does and i think it's because he's done so much that's one and two he's been so prolific that i mean he's written so many words so many words that it's it's difficult for me i don't you know i'm not a um i didn't go to school for philosophy it's difficult for me to wrap my head around bertrand russell but then i look at something like this and i can start to tether him to all these other ideas and concepts domains people and that that's how learning is done that's how we don't just it's not a one and done the one and done approach that that i've done for way too long and so many people you go on wikipedia because you heard about this person and then you know how long does do you last there before you burn out and you remember that information for two days and then you forget it you don't come back to it but with this sort of context i can really start to see how i can tether this to you know other people and really create what's going on in in real life which is part of that conversation that bertrand russell was a part of when he was living and interacting with these other ideas and people who came much before him oftentimes absolutely i mean that that's one of the things that that you know this started just as a school project i was learning d3 which is this amazing data visual database library and then it really just became something where i was like i can really build something i think very helpful and very interesting here because as you're saying those and i say in the home page you know the web of knowledge that links ideas philosophers schools of thought together is important in any field but i think that it's especially true in philosophy you know there there's a saying that philosophy is the great conversation and and in some sense that's true and the way in which philosophy progresses is through understanding the conceptual and creative links that these different ideas have spurred in each other you know and and to go on your point about so you want to know about russell and the wikipedia article's too long and the scp article is too long one of the other things that you can do that i didn't show yet is so you're on the russell graph and you open up this details and when you open up the details you get a bit more of the abstract depending on the length of the abstract i still have to cut it off some because i don't want i'm not interested in people reading the article here i want to push them into the set to learn about the things that they want but so with you nick all right you know about russell but you don't really understand exactly what it is so when you open up the article details you have this table of contents here now i'm pulling this from the encyclopedia itself but these are all active links so if what you want to learn about is specifically you want to learn about russell and his atheism then you come down here you click on that link and it not only brings you into the article at the encyclopedia but when it loads it'll actually bring you down into that particular part of the article so okay now we're just at russell's atheism and if that's something that you were interested in then you could just come there and any article that you use in visualizing sep that table of contents is always an active link and it's always going to bring you right inside the encyclopedia article itself at that particular anchor point that that's really amazing that it goes right to the the anchor point i i mean i just can't get over this though because there are so many people that i've looked at and i've just kind of always wondered you know what do they connect to they're always in isolation you know this person had this idea and that was important i guess but it it's always in isolation and it comes and it goes and without the broader conversation it's kind of been sad to me how much of that those sources of philosophy have escaped me from being able to kind of build in this this way that i find quite sustainable you know note making what we might say in my neck of the woods but um in a way that scales and compounds in personal value over time that's what this tool is just i'm just so excited about it thank you yeah and i completely agree and and that's one of the things that when i was building it i was really trying to figure out how to make it make a fun and pretty interface but also one that was powerful because you know when you have your own aha moments in the shower or you're walking down the street and a car goes by and the screech of the tire then makes you think of a song that you heard and then that song that you heard was like oh you know what i have a problem at work that now i just figured out how to do it because i i was spurred through i didn't figure that out on my own it wasn't my my my free will sitting down there and figuring out that answer it was this intuitive creation at that moment and for this site itself i really wanted to build in those intuitive moments so you can explore it in an infinite number of ways you know how you want how you want to go around that russell graphics you want to look at wickenstein or you want to look at more or you want to look at something in epistemology and logic your own individual path through the graph is going to be providing context for you to have new intuitions absolutely that's a good way to look at it too then those new intuitions i like that a lot because it's the opposite of being told what to do whether that's by a top-down curriculum or in the world of like task management if you have too strong of a task list that's telling you what to do and then well hey great you don't have to worry about it you know that anxiety goes down that's nice but you also lose something you lose that intuitive ability to adapt to new information and maybe do something that is now the priority in that same way this this kind of draws out a more organic intuitive way of approaching ideas and learning yeah absolutely you know it's like you're on russell you've now explored this whole graph and you know you're just having fun like you know doing this wheelie thing where it's pretty but you know now you're like all right i've started with russell what i really want to look at is the correspondence theory of truth and so you most of the article you double-click that article and then the graph reloads and then this is how you start to navigate between the articles not just seeing the relationships of one article but now you can navigate the entire encyclopedia in a really efficient really fun manner so you come to the correspondence theory of truth article and you can do all the same things okay these particular set of links that are active these are the subset relations these that share this context now you can just jump through and each time you jump through you get again every other article linked to so now i'm going to feminist philosophy of law so now i can now get into something into the critical theories and from the front from these critical theories now i can explore the incredible critique of western philosophy that feminism has spurred and got us to think in new ways so i mentioned earlier philosophy is known as the great conversation but it's absolutely true that more people have been excluded from that conversation than have taken part in that conversation and we will absolutely want to get beyond those limitations and and those exclusions and how one way you could do this is now you're at feminist philosophy of law and now you can get into the critical theories and all of these different articles now we can get into this is going to be on about ableism and now we can get into the part of the encyclopedia where we're getting into the critical theories about the tradition that we're both exploring but also now we're critiquing and that's i think one of the things that makes the stanford encyclopedia such a powerful tool because i think they're very aware of now who has been excluded and now they're building out additional sections so there's much more information on non-western philosophy and chinese philosophy on feminism and we can then start to learn from within the tradition those critiques of the condition itself yeah absolutely which one is much needed everyone needs to have a voice at the table that's how those diverse perspectives allow us all to be more enriched and and two it's i think i forgot my two so i'll go to three which is i'm so happy that these topics are being included especially going back to another point you know i'd run into somebody like uh mencius a chinese philosopher i'm like that this person is saying things and i think plato's probably said similar things but i don't quite you know i'm an amateur here i don't quite understand how to make that link and and this is i'm so excited to jump back into it explore that that person from long long ago mencius and and understand you know where he falls into this this great conversation a couple things because i i don't want to run out of time here so a couple things that i think are interesting i want to go over are our links are your choices on primary domain where you mentioned thinker and just what what information the stanford encyclopedia philosophy provided you and what information you added as tags so to speak okay so what i found interesting is the the tool of choice that i use to manage knowledge is obsidian and they now have the ability to be more clear about the direction of a link so yes not everything is bi-directional you can say by default it is meaning you know a link you're connecting two pieces of knowledge but is it incoming or outgoing that's kind of important and i think what you're showing here is putting a spotlight on why it's important in a very practical fully encapsulated example uh a lot of people are wondering why do i need incoming links or we they're just all links right but you're showing an actual use case because you're tracking references and a story that's being told and so it's it's really clear here i just it's so amazing to me to see this type of use case yeah you know and everything at all the articles in the sep there is the authors and then there's the editorial board that reviews all of this so and they're going to come up with what's validly going to be linked and what those link directions mean now it doesn't mean that you there's an intuition that a bi-directional link might have stronger weight than that not only does article a link to article b but article b also loops back to articles so there there is a certain uh default intuition that that might be a stronger relationship between those two articles it's not necessarily the case because there are going to be different editors and different people on the board at different times and different authors so it's not something that you can say is a canonical example of relationships but i think it is something where it is interesting when you look at who's linking to what and how and that does tell you something it might not tell you everything you think it does but it tells you something interesting about those relationships and it's something that you've you can't explore i mean there are articles that have you know zero bi-directional links and there are articles that you would think that would be linked together that actually don't share one so it's it's it's it's not a perfect use case like for example the article on david hume human kant are related in a lot of ways kant has this really famous saying that reading hume awoke him from his dogmatic slumbers that hume's critique of metaphysics and epistemology really spurred kant to develop his own critical theory now the human article doesn't link to the kant article directly so that's something that that's an expectation that if you already know that then you're like huh that's surprising so these aren't perfect but there are enough opportunities for overlap and intuition building and coming together then even though they're not perfect i think they're still really helpful yeah absolutely and and good analysis of their about how we can approach it here and then and person personally it's interesting so in one's personal knowledge management you can't be a little bit more confident that a bi-directional link would carry more weight but to your point when you're looking at a collection of different editors and contributors it's only one data point to help build intuition like like you said that was a good term intuition building okay the other ones i'm really curious about those primary domains like we're looking on the right yep those were provided by the the architecture of sep right they were not actually uh wow the encyclopedia doesn't have a domain tagging metadata feature if you go to the to the main table of contents it's broken down into certain categories like there's a category for quantum mechanics there's a category for aesthetics but they don't actually spend a lot of time trying to provide domain categories for the articles so everything that you see i built what i did is there's a um a project at indiana university called the indiana university philosophy ontology project and they developed a domain taxonomy by which to link articles together and and tag them info the info project for people who are watching it's info.org i can put that in the chat when we're done if you want to see how this taxonomy was um built so what i did is i took the taxonomy that indiana university developed and theirs is much more detailed but i took about i think there's 27 categories uh that i used and so what i did is i took the categories that i wanted to fit the articles into and then through a mix of text search topic modeling and just old-fashioned hard-coding uh i actually went through and i tagged every article with at least one domain most articles i've tagged with having multiple domains and i did that because i wasn't just making things up i was trying to be really broad stroke and how to tag an article because i was seeing them like language games each taxonomy that we use is itself a it's it's a trade-off you know but between specificity and openness and for the user of the site i wanted them to be able to see and follow whatever train of thought that spurred in their mind so for this article here on feminist perspectives on disability well clearly the primary domain is going to be feminism but this is also going to be tagged with social and political philosophy because now we're talking about a particular cultural practice about ableism and disability so for all of these articles you're you're probably going to have two three i think i tapped out maybe four was the most that i added but the idea was that this article then will appear within multiple domains so if you're looking at something from the grouping level you're not limited to just the most perfect secure version of what category this is you're navigating a space where there are really fluid boundaries uh and again so you could then explore your own intuitions and follow that train of thought i actually haven't shown the domain graph yet so why don't i bring that up and then we can talk more about this because that that was a really fun but also difficult part of this project i would say and to joe's point in the chat okay like now this is an even bigger wow that's a massive contribution to the world's knowledge that you know that you took took forth and to categorize all these articles which i'm sure you have you know roughly how many articles there are and it's going to be a big number 1708 1708 articles that you categorized using this you know indiana universities project that ontology as kind of your structure but then to make sense of it in that way and that's what you're doing you're making sense of this for the rest of us and trying to do your best responsibly to provide this information through these domains so i i just like that's a big while i think i need to really address that it's not just you you know clicking a couple magic programming buttons and it's all done like you you put in a lot of thinking yourself like your own sense-making so i mean i don't know how to best say bravo to you but i just yeah keep going show us the domain graph but that's just something really awesome oh yeah cool so yeah so i'll start with these two but again every article has and as i update you'll see that the different names change based on the article itself so we'll start with and sorry just one interruption because i love constraints so are you telling me that there's roughly around 20 you said 27 domains was that accurate okay that's good to know yep so we'll actually go to to uh this article here which now has there are three domains that this article is tagged with there's social and political there's ethics and then there's philosophy of biology now depending on how we want to model disability then maybe that is a question for the philosophy of biology how do you define that generally speaking though this is going to be an issue about social theory and ethics so if you want to load the domain graph there is in the search bar you can just select a domain but in this case just double click on this now we're coming to the other part of the site and this is a network graph of every article that has been tagged with social and political philosophy and when the graph loads there's no labels on the nodes because that was going to be too cognitively dissonant to make all that stuff but this is showing you something from right here you can look at the size of each particular node is going to correspond to the number of links within that particular domain that article shares so these nodes that have the biggest circles this is going to be a major central point of this domain now when i mouse out there now this guy up here this is there's no other links it's a smaller circle because it's at the periphery of this domain so just by looking at the main graph you get some sense of the structure now over here on the right though you're going to see all right there's 291 articles that are tagged with social and political philosophy now that's going to be both as its primary domain and its secondary domain so you'll then be able to see from in from this list that there are different colors have different primary domains but these domains link these are fluid boundaries so you'll see then the top five now this is going to be the top five articles in the domain in terms of where they sit within directional networks liberalism 61 okay that has the most links and when you mouse over instead of putting the nodes on the labels right by the nodes themselves that was going to be too dissonant we just put them on the side and then they're linked alphabetically so you can get a sense of what else liberalism links to now the second article here is john ross john rawls is a philosopher the most famous and important political philosopher of the last 50 years so he's he's a philosopher first so he has a different color he has a different domain but of course he's part of this draft and now we come down here consequentialism this is the fifth most linked graph in this domain that's ethics ethics is the main domain that consequentially will live in but of course consequentialism is going to be part of a social and political philosophy and so you had you have now this list down here of every different article in the domain different colors so that you know exactly where you are what the central focus of each of these articles is but as you start to explore here now you can see all right this links to this and this links to this and but we have the same um user experience features here you can then click on a node and now and now the graph is frozen again just like before and as you come down here it's actually going to show you where that particular article lives within that domain network it's going to show you that kind of laser beam but also here hold down the shift key and you can get the domain details get the article details and just like before it's the articles that are going to be hidden they're going to dim and then you can scroll the list to see okay these are the articles now within this particular domain these share links together and again you can just continually navigate this particular domain relationships you can reset the graph to go back to the main thing and if you're on an article you double click a node now you can go back to the article graph and get information about that article within the encyclopedia not just within that particular domain but you can then just keep going back and forth depending on the information that you're interested in exploring at this one time and there are all these different or where's my oh you have this recent searches button here this is going to be your 10 most recent searches so if you were like you know hey i actually want to go back to something that i saw you forget what it was you can come up here and then it'll find that again but if you want to just to go to look at all the domains let me get here and now you have a list of every domain and the domain are colored and the the color scheme that i chose was 27 bits of data that's way too many colors to try to define an easy to read graph so what i did is i grouped them and the articles on philosophy of science philosophy of physics these are blues um they're now they're different blues philosophy of biology is a lighter shade of blue than philosophy of physics which is a lighter shade of blue than philosophy of science philosophy of say mathematics all right that's going to be probably linked more to logic and philosophy of computer science so these are greens and philosophy of language also a greenish color so when you're looking at the different colors and with the domain names you're actually looking also at a color grouping of of similarity of domains now we don't i don't want to we didn't want to do this where the only thing when the only differentiator there was color we want to use the names first because there are people who have colored deficiencies but this is just an additional way of being able to look at this information and then see how different domains might be linked together as well yeah it kind of sounds like the bi-directional link sort of thing where it's it's a it's suggesting something you need to look into it to kind of understand what it is so in their intuition builder yeah or absolutely understanding the context yeah so you showed us the recent searches at the top the domain search with the 27 and then in search article the only other one i was just kind of curious at it seems like we can search by title or search actually within all of the text or what does that mean exactly the text okay so when you're looking on the site itself the the default way of searching for articles is just looking for a relationship of words in the title based on what you're looking for if you want to look for actual text or concepts the um with within the full text of the article itself you have to click on this text button here and in this case it would be i mean you might want to use it if you were looking for a philosopher that you expected to be in there but wasn't maybe someone like noam chomsky so if you wanted to to search chomsky well there are no articles on chomsky but chomsky might appear within the text of an article about someone so then you could go do do a text search hit go now the the one thing here though is when you do this text search this brings you back over to the stanford site i'm not able to do a direct search from inside visualizing sep of the database in the encyclopedia itself that they use because i built this as a passion project on my own stanford didn't hire me to do this this was just something that like i wanted to do for myself so i don't have i don't have the access rights to get into their domain um so but if you want to do that you you go when you do a search select the text button and then the text you search for in visualizing set will bring you into the actual stanford site so now all right now these are the articles that the stanford site is going to mention that references noam chomsky so in this case this is one thing that i i would like to make it more seamless i would need to actually get permission from them to do that so i i haven't done it but in this case then you could just remember all right this is philosophy of linguistics you could come back here and then if you want to see that graph there for philosophy of linguistics here we go now you can go in and you can look at the philosophy of linguistics article graph back inside visualizing sap okay yeah quite amazing i think we should open it up for some questions just want to make sure though is there is there anything that you want to hit at that we haven't covered yet i don't think so this is something that i'm going to keep updating i i actually haven't updated uh it yet for the summer stanford releases updates every three months um and normally when they release an update for what what's been added to the encyclopedia i immediately go in import those updates so i'm always keeping the site live in terms of what's related to stanford however i haven't updated from the june update yet because i've been so busy with with my other client work but i'm always updating the site every three four months to make sure that this will stay current with what's new and updated in this encyclopedia itself that's amazing that you're doing that and you're just doing it because it's a passion project so uh hopefully you can continue doing that and and if not then hopefully you know people can start paying you to do that uh but yeah before we get into a what was the best place if people wanted to reach out to you you know what would you where would you want to send them to so my website just for my business work is josephdecastrollc.com i think you had that in the link for the event um and if they want to send me an email joe at josephdecastrollc.com my business website that's probably the the best way to get a hold of me okay cool and then let's both open the q a and i can kind of read them out loud but just so you can see them ahead of time and it seems like tj there are a few that have three thumbs up so i'm going to go with those those three the first one if you can see but i'll read it out loud how has using visualizing sep changed your workflow the way you think it's kind of solidified the way in which i like to work and produce knowledge i definitely have a habit where i can get caught in a loop and you know if i'm debugging a project that i'm working on or i'm writing something i just end up hitting the same thing the same thing and i'm in a loop and i can't break out of it and one of the things that this project has really made me think of when i'm in one of those loops is no you want to build a new intuition you want to be presented with something that is going to be new not exactly what it is that you were looking for you mentioned in the event info um i studied filmmaking in college and there's a really really famous film editor walter murch uh who's just revolutionary editor and sound designer and he wrote a book about the transition from editing on film itself to editing digitally and one of the things that he said that was really interesting and applies to this is when you're editing on film especially you have these giant flat bed editors where you have ten minute reels of film and i'm sure you're aware of this of this nick and you you had a steam back or a moviola and you had to go forward or backward you didn't have access to everything you had access to your 10-minute reel and then you had to switch that switch the reel up for a different part of the um of the film merch said that one of the things that he has missed in the transition from from film to digital ones that digital only always gives you exactly what you want and there and there's a tyranny to only getting what you want whereas when you're editing a sequence in film having to scroll back and forth and back and forth you're presented with with similar information but it's not quite the same and that was something that he used for his own creativity for the way in which he wanted to cut a scene is that process of going back and forth gave him what he needed and not necessarily what he wanted and i think that's what that's a decent metaphor for thinking about how to how to navigate philosophy with the site but how the metaphor of visualizing sep can also impact our own thinking yeah you just gave me an aha moment i'm not even kidding because i haven't read that book it's foundational for anyone who wants to edit it absolutely right and i always thought wow how i missed missed being able to crank on this thing where all the footage is flying past you and that's the only way you can navigate it and i i just realized though that that was something that i've kind of taken into that linking your thinking methodology with flying around uh links and navigating structures that that you build that have personally meaningful value to you and why that's so important is because it's through the navigation that where i imagine in the brain neurons are connecting because you're actively making these connections again as you go through this footage into your point intuition building but i never i never thought about that metaphor but it was there it was in the way back in my mind i've been guiding that because of you know his words of how valuable it was to get those kind of almost subconscious repetitions yeah of how things are are connected and and what they are uh so wow thank you for bringing that up that's that's quite something merch is a genius yeah here's from edith uh now that this resource exists how easy hard would it be to create similar tools for other sets of interlea interlinked documents such as a person's pkm or even all of wikipedia so that's actually one of the things that um i'm actively exploring in the back of my head because i i i haven't had time for actually uh to do this but the architecture for visualizing sep is it's pretty specific to the document structure of the encyclopedia itself but i'm really interested in taking this metaphor and really finding ways to to generalize this relationship and taking this and using visualizing sep really as a prototype interface for developing interfaces to explore any large-scale networked set of data uh i think there's there's a real potential here to really change the way we explore large data sets so it it's not a simple process edith but it's absolutely something that can be done uh if you want to send me an email we can talk about it i i met someone else from having published my site and he and i are kind of trying to work on some ideas about how we can take this metaphor and apply it to different data sets to that point it's interesting to see how you did it so the thing that i keep on thinking that really draws my attention is that you chose out of indiana's ontology system you found 27 domains it wasn't 270. you know take off that zero it was 27 and that seemed to be with how many notes is 1708 1708 articles articles okay 1708 articles 27 so i'm just trying to do you know what are these kind of um invisible um real what am i trying to say invisible uh ratios that start to form that give us meaningful value and is it's just one data point with one data set but i think it's interesting so if we just take that out loud these are the things i'm interested in so basically 78 1708 divided by 27 so 63 articles for every domain i know they're linked in multiple ways and they're they're fluid but i'm just trying to think out loud how how these relationships form yeah i mean if you go to the about page on the site uh it'll actually show you the number of articles and there are 18 000 links between the articles and the 27 domains and and it's it's the first time that i visualized this i actually tried to visualize the entire data set all at once and and just my computer was like nope there are too many edges like when when you look at network graph theory and then you have the links and the edges um the way in which um d3 initially uses these these svg graphics for the web and 18 000 links for an svg in a browser window was not going to work now there's different ways you could visualize that but that's too much data you know like like we don't have the ability to really make meaning from that many data points that that aren't structured but the way when you can break it down and organize it now you can make meaning through these large data sets but in these individual chunks yeah yeah this is this is pretty wild we have five more minutes until we're at the hour mark so if you're reading through these do you see the q and a's joe yep if there's any that really jump out to you go ahead i can answer asher's question about how are the links generated the way in which i did this is i used um there's a library in python called beautiful soup and it's a web scraping library so i scraped the entire encyclopedia downloaded all the articles and then i wrote a spider to basically look at individual parts of each article each article in the uh let me find it here i'll show you um every article in the sep has a section called related entries and what that is is those are the links that the editors and the authors uh see i can show to you here here we go so in this article here there is this article links out to three other articles so how i built the links for this is when i scraped the entire site i i captured every article in every related entry from this section of the page in every article i threw that into my database and then i ran a series of links looking at like what was going out from each article and then how those different links when looked at which linked into what and then that's how i built the actual graphs themselves is by looking at all the information in the related entry section for each of the 1708 articles and that's where we get the power because this is these are the articles that the editors were like all right the this is related and that's where that's where visualizing set gets all of its power it's from this related entry section that's pulled from every single article very nice something that seems to be standing out i'm looking at jon's uh comment or question there but that in this also i see another comment from john a little bit later on uh two days ago we had on ryan j a murphy and he was talking about integrated thinking environment so you must be familiar with ides integrated development environments since you can program and then so he's saying there are these integrated thinking environments such as obsidian logsec rome those type of tools that allow us at least from a personal knowledge management position to create these environments that help our thinking and they can do so many things they can do whatever we need them to do it's very exciting time and it does seem as though what you're showing is possible with these large data sets other ways to kind of create these integrated thinking environments what i like about it and this i'm just trying to like kind of tie this into john's question at the top there joe that you can see but um it's we have this information there's no there was a time when it was hard to get your hands on a book it was hard to get you know access to things we're not there anymore if if we have access to the internet we're not there we have too much and so it's really about knowing where the signal is that's part one but then part two is kind of and there's a responsibility from people who are sharing this information in a way to kind of evoke the audience to lean forward and somehow engage and wrestle with the material doesn't mean they will doesn't mean they will but that's i think one of the fun challenges that we find ourselves in is how to present information so it can become personal knowledge that people can grow with i think what you're doing is great i'm just kind of curious your comments on this as it might tie into you know john's question comment there yeah i think to john's point that the idea that this was both educational and actionable was kind of built into what i was trying to do with that you know we have a system where the nice thing about something like the standard encyclopedia is it's a gatekeeper resource like the these articles have been vetted and we can then take that knowledge from that has been vetted and now we can provide a new way to interface with it and in that way there really is this this ability to challenge ourselves like one of the things that like i always say is i love to lose an argument and in argument i mean like a discussion if i'm talking to my friend about something and my friend just destroys the premise of my argument i'm like awesome thank you you you have done me a service because where my thinking was incorrect where where it had gone off you have now shown me where where where i went wrong like if you read any of my writing my writing it could be really pedantic sometimes because i really try to show the structure of how i got to my conclusion so that the the person that that who's reading my article can be like no uh at inference c is you went totally off the rails and that's how you should have done it and for me like i have no shame and when i'm wrong with something like that because i got to learn something new today and i think these resources increase the ability that there's no shame in being incorrect if you're incorrect honestly you thought you were making the best argument yes motivated reasoning and confirmation bias are the devils that hide in all of our brains uh being aware of those kinds of biases though gives you that opportunity to actually alter and hopefully improve your your thought process not just in terms of the answers but the way in which you're even approaching the questions themselves yeah this is just really great joe i think we've kind of hit on this again and again but you know the why you did this and you know what's it all about for you it seems that you there's just so much joy and passion that's gone into this so what are your final words around visualizing sep i hope everyone loves it and everyone who uses it can get the pleasure out of it that i get i mean in some sense i built a tool for me you know i built something that like i would like to use that like i think is cool and pretty and functional and i don't think i'm i'm the only one there you know you reached out to me i know folks have enjoyed it and i'm really excited that folks are using it and and enjoying it and you know i definitely plan on just you know keeping this site live for as long as i can adding to it having fun with it i want to grow it eventually and yeah i'm just really glad that folks are enjoying it well uh bravo to you i'm going to do the raised hands toggle which is a way that we can give joe some digital claps or high fives now this is seriously is really great what i what i hope comes from this is i i really mean this you're a great brilliant mind in this world and what's really cool is we've all come at it from a little bit of a different angle i think like myself you know i kind of stumbled backwards into this obsidian beta and then all of a sudden became really i guess somebody out there talking about knowledge management and you came at it from a completely different place your love and passion for philosophy just kind of putting these things together and it's really interesting to kind of see how we're all solving problems around you know meaningful knowledge and so i hope that some other people reach out to you and continue working with you so your your your brilliant mind can kind of maybe go into other data sets or it can be applied to other situations because uh i i love what you're doing here and it's you've just provided such a beautiful gift for all of us thank you so much bravo to you thank you thank you everyone and yeah please anyone reach out to me if you have questions questions comments criticism thoughts i i would love to hear it i would love to talk about it okay we'll wrap things up now and i'll make sure if anyone if anyone didn't see joe's email or website in the chat and then you didn't see it in the event bio either just reach out to me too if you're wondering how to get a hold of joe and we'll we'll make it happen okay well thank you so much uh thanks for everyone's time and thank you again joe for your your presence and amazing amazing chat with you today so wishing everyone the best this was great thank you so much nick and everyone bye for now all right [Music] [Music] you
