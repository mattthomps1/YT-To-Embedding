the thing about apps like obsidian is that you've been handed the keys to a state-of-the-art hovercraft and with great power comes great responsibility we can get lost once we start looking into the settings there are so many things we can do so you have to ask yourself why like why enable start files why enable page preview now is it because you don't want to forget a certain file then yeah do the start file that's an easy one but as you start looking at these settings they're very intimidating because there's so much that you can do we have to keep in mind gold's law which is simply this any complex system was created from a bunch of simple systems that have stood the test of time you can't create complex systems from scratch and hope that they'll work they're fragile they'll break because they're not tested they're not forged through actual use so the same thing applies once we start thinking in terms of structure even though right now we're just talking about settings less is more we grow as we go so let's keep that in mind let's dive in so picking up from where we left off let's make a new note and i'm going to paste in the next lesson the eight most important settings in obsidian obsidian is full of so many settings so just choosing eight was kind of a difficult thing to do but we're going to keep it simple and we're going to find out hey we don't have to touch those other settings and everything just works so first let's explore a little bit we're going to go to this cog icon which is the settings and open up this pop-up window now exit out of there by clicking away let's start with the editor first and let's go to the first one so here's the editor and we're going to go down this list a little bit first one though the automatic settings that they have is what you'll need don't have to do anything but if you'd like hey turn on spell check so that's number one easy right number two we're going to look at the plug-in menu plug-ins menu and there are three things that we will do okay so plug-in i guess i had it spelled right first one remember how in the previous video we started to add tags well now let's turn on the tag pane and it's going to show up right here okay so we'll return that shortly page preview very cool for a future video we'll turn it on now and start notes so we don't forget those notes that we might want to keep handy let's exit out here so what did we do we we created this we enabled the tag pane and that has created this so now we can click on concept and we can see the times that concept comes up we can click on people and see when people comes up and we can go back to the backlinks tab and back to the tags so that's the tag and let's go back to folder page preview we'll look at in the future starred notes so now we have the starred note here and what we can do is let's say we want to start this note we can go up to the more options part of this note which is sort of this sandwich these three circles and we can go down and star this note now when we have what do we have there eight notes it's not a big deal but when you have 800 notes or even just 80 notes you might want to star something then you can just go here really quickly let's imagine i was on note star and i wanted to get back to the topic for this conversation then i just click back to our note cool right i like to stay on file explorer on the side and that's halfway through so let's go now to the next part of the settings just file and deleted files so it's important that we decide where we want to keep our files now for me i kind of like to keep it in the system trash and what that means is it's your computer your file system's trash let's explore that really fast let's say i create a new note and i title it nonsense i don't want to keep it so i right click and i'll hit delete and i'll confirm that it's deleted so where did it go it actually just went to the max trash folder and here it is so that's what i would prefer that you do then you always know where deleted notes go and you want them to go somewhere you're familiar with all right going on the next one this is bolded because out of everything in the settings i find this to be the most important one especially once you start linking and changing the names of the files that you link to you want them to always update turn this on so now that means see this note never note it's linked to note star right so what if we change note star to note star 2 i click away it gives me this up here updated three links in one file so now i'm going to go to never note and check this out never note has updated note star 2. that means that when i command click on it it takes me to note star so that is so crucial this is the most important setting in anything that you do with obsidian turn it on now final two let's look at appearance we have dark mode and we have light mode hopefully that didn't hurt your eyes too much we're going to explore themes in a upcoming video and also we're going to explore custom themes that will be pretty fun right now we won't touch them too much and finally in an upcoming video we're going to look at hotkeys so we can do a preview like that with a touch of a button and really see what this format might look like when it's outside of the edit mode of markdown so the settings are just another control panel on your hovercraft make a few round trips first before you try to fine tune your experience that way you know what you're looking for and what you're trying to accomplish but it's not the settings for translucency as cool as that is that's not what brought you to an app like obsidian it's the ability to write and think and link ideas like never before so make sure your best attention is going to the writing and the thinking and the linking and if you like this video next up we're going to cover custom themes dark mode light mode and all the things in between so you can customize that look we're not going to dwell on it because we want to write think and link but that doesn't mean that we can't create something that looks a lot of fun to use as always thank you so much for watching i
