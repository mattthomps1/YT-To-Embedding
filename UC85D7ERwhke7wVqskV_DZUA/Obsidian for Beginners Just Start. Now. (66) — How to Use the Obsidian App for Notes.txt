hey if you're still with me this far thank you 
so much for your attention hopefully you found   these videos useful and valuable there is so 
much that we can do with tools like obsidian   like rome research online or even like the 
archive on the mac there is so much that we can   do it doesn't mean that we have to do it if i can 
leave you with one thought and it's an opinionated   thought but i hope you take it to heart i can 
leave you with one thought it's this these tools   they can capture all this information out there 
you can save articles you can clip you can   copy and paste and you can fill your digital note 
libraries full of other people's thoughts and it   will feel good it'll be this little dopamine rush 
when you click clip when you when you copy and   paste and you'll feel good momentarily but i can 
tell you from experience that over the course of   several years as the percentage of words in 
your library become the words of somebody else   the percentage of your own notes decreases and 
so does the joy that your library can give you   the chaos increases and the productivity can 
often decrease that's what happened to me so i   leave you with this point just start just start 
creating you have enough tools at your disposal   you know the settings you know the basic markdown 
and you know a few hot keys that's all you need   you have a unique nuanced perspective to offer 
this world sure you need to learn and ingest new   materials but then you need to take it and connect 
it with other ideas with your own thoughts because   that's how we get these interesting amalgamations 
of your unique perspective on an issue on a take   on a genre and then you take that and you connect 
it to other areas and disciplines and domains   and from that you create something new a new 
perspective that makes us all feel more enriched   from what you've provided so if i can make one 
point as clear as possible don't just take notes   make notes that's linking your thinking that's 
the why and how of making meaningful notes   thank you so much for your time hey if you

about you saw sneak peek in these videos   also you know make any comments down below 
please you know be respectful if you can   i will read all and respond to all and i 
look forward to serving you and providing   you with the materials that you need to take 
your thinking to another level thank you you
