ideas and a lot of moving parts to keep track of she came to the linking your thinking workshop looking for ways to better manage it all and in the following showcase amy outlines some of the ways she is using obsidian to track content use and reuse to get the most out of everything she creates let's join amy now so i came into this workshop really wanting to get organized with my uh with well with lots of things but one of them is this business i have called nomad topia where there is there are a lot of moving parts there's a lot i have a ton of ideas there's a lot of content flying around i've been doing this for 10 years so i've got 10 years of content and podcasts and courses and workshops and you know creating new stuff all the time so this is part of what i wanted to build here that i could actually resource and pull from all of those things and stay organized and actually reuse some things also so i'm going to show a couple different pieces here and i have these highlighted just so i would remember what i wanted to show you this is my marketing moc and um this i think actually let me jump down here first so i'm using data view to just pull in things that i've tagged so this is everything that's tagged with the marketing um idea and i noticed too that because i have the i'm not sure it's called preview hover or whatever is turned on so even these that are just daily notes if i hover over it i can scroll through here and find this is a terribly long daily note but um you know somewhere in there is the part of with the idea for marketing so i can find that fairly easily these are ideas i just dumped in here from another note making app um but it's helpful to know i now have a place i can find everything and i know where to put things this i'm super excited about because i think for a long time i was struggling with you know like using spreadsheets or something as a way to kind of keep track of where things were in the pipeline in terms of creating content but then also the writing was happening somewhere else so i've been doing this for the last few months and i'm really psyched to have a place where all of these things can live together just in the last few days i started to kind of fall out of favor with this idea of putting the date at the beginning of the title my idea was then at a glance i could see what had been published um but i don't know if that really needs to be at the forefront and then also um as nick talks about the you know proximity thing these all show up next to each other and the explorer which maybe is good maybe it's not good i don't know um one thing that i wanted to share because i noticed some people have been using kanbans to you know like organize where content is in a workflow and that's definitely something i've been thinking about but this is something i'm playing around with have not gotten very far but i wanted to share in case anyone else was interested in this or maybe has ideas about what to do with it there is a piece of software called air or like an app or whatever called air story which a lot of content marketers have been really excited about in the last few years and it basically you can create a library of content blocks so you'd have you know things you've written before you can pull excerpts from blog posts from things you read online whatever and then you'd be able to drag and drop those into a document essentially and so i thought well since this is where all my content is what can i make something like that here so if you do like a transclusion kind of thing and i know i have a couple other notes on connection then you do shift six which i just learned the other day from watching one of nick's videos um and then i can just hit enter and now this block shows up and maybe oh let's see maybe i would put that at the top of this article or you know and then i can link out here to this quote is from power virtual so that's about as far as i've gotten with this but i feel like there's some potential here and as you'll see as i get into some other parts i'm really interested in seeing how i can you know repurpose and use things that i already have so i'm going to go back here [Music] i have a whole separate moc for my podcast just because that's you know something that has a lot of its own moving parts and i can see at a glance kind of where things are at i've got links to where i these things live elsewhere and then this is transcluded in here a separate note and i'm not sure if i'm going to keep it that way but basically this is where i'm tracking you know what i'm working on with the podcast from here i'm going to jump over to the collective moc the nomatopia collective actually was funny jonathan has collected in the name of his project also um the nomiatopia collective is my online community for nomads and expats and so there's a lot of moving pieces here as well and i'm going to show you a couple one so i have kind of a similar you know list of pulling in ideas down here for a long time i've struggled with how to keep track of you know articles and things that i'd like to share with the community so this is something i'm playing around with is pulling in this i created as a separate note and then tagged it to share in the collective and then this is the date the note was created because sometimes things are really timely this one not so much but you know if i don't share it within the next week or something not really any point so this i'm hoping will help me stay better you know tracking what i've been pulling together and whether it's been shared and so on here there's two other little pieces here i want to share this is the um we do monthly themes in the collective and so kind of you know guiding the conversation uh throughout the month and now that i'm i've spent a lot the last week learning a lot about data view and playing with it and now that i'm aware of that more i'm thinking there might be a way to kind of flip this around i basically was creating the notes here um and and you know doing that kind of manually there might be something i can do differently but then i have a template that i use to you know plan for the next uh the next theme and then again i hope that then there's stuff here that i can reuse maybe even reuse the whole theme again or you know play on some variation of it then this is the last thing that um i have a ton of courses well i have courses that i've created in the past and i'm now pulling a lot of that content into new kind of mini courses that are going to live in my community and be available just for members and so there's a lot of repurposing going on and i'm trying to figure out how to keep track of it all for now what i'm psyched about is one having again a data view thing down here to track kind of where things are at and then i created a note for each course and this is just here again so i remember that's the one i want to show you i just created this and this is going to be a template or it is a template also this is a course i'm working on right now and i want to keep track where this came from you know in terms of repurposing this came from another course i did and i actually just shared this in today's newsletter a little piece of this so i can see that right here at a glance and then here's this is the actual course content and i created a separate note for each lesson and then i have those transcluded in here and ellen was just talking about admonition blocks and i was like wait what's that so i don't know if that's something that could be useful here but that definitely caught my attention since i've created these kinds of blocks um but what i love is that you know in the course platform that i use and i think a lot of the ones that are out there you know everything's broken up into like you can see one section or one lesson at a time and this way i can see all of it in one place but also be able to just click into one other thing and then who knows maybe this you know becomes a blog post or something and so there's lots of ways that i can see approaching things from different angles and yeah i have lost track of time so i think i'm gonna stop there as someone who also has a ton of ideas and content new and old i really get a lot out of seeing amy talk through her process of managing content hopefully this showcase gave you some inspiration on how you can manage all of your content what is something positive you took away from watching this showcase let us know in the comments below amy's showcase is the 11th showcase i've been able to share out of well over 100 from the linking your thinking workshops there are so many more people i hope to share with you because they show how personal the process of personal knowledge management can be thanks for tuning in to this showcase and until next time stay connected
