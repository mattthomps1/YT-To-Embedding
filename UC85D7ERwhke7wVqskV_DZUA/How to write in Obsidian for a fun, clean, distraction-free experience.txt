if you are a writer how can you add structure and produce finalized works while maintaining an environment that allows you to be your most intuitive and creative self in the following showcase anya aka a.s renner shows the way anya has published non-fiction books on minimalism self-publishing and nutrition as a coach for intuitive writing she supports creatives in finding their voice and helps them find the answer to the question how can something you're so passionate about be so hard for her obsidian is the perfect playground for creative endeavors a safe space that you can design according to your personal needs in the following you will hear about anya's struggles with writing the kind of workplace she's created to write so well and how she uses folders let's check out anya's process now and i want to start off with a thank you like a lot of people did before me and i of course want to thank you nick for the course and crew 15 and martin who's here as well and i also want to have a shout out to elena because i use her custom theme i think it's very beautiful and i love it and i also want to shout out to sanna because she inspired me to use emojis as you will see later and a bit about me i am a writer of fiction and non-fiction and i'm a writing coach as well and my main interests in the beginning of the course i thought i'm just doing this yeah to be able to create content better and yeah when i answered the questionnaire in the beginning i realized no it's all about sense making for me this is the most important part for me and also what i really like about writing the process of sense making and even with my novel writing i really enjoy to understand the words i'm writing about the people i'm writing about so sense making is biggie for me and as a writer of course i have some struggles still for instance with non-fiction writing i had stopped writing non-fiction for a while i have published some books on minimalism nutrition and other topics i'm really personally interested in but i always felt a bit like an imposter because i yeah i just got the ideas from other people and i kind of wrote about their thoughts and ideas and i never felt like i was writing the things that were going through my head and so it really helped me this linking your thinking that i can now also make new connections and i can go deeper into the topics and get create ideas on my own and also bring them into my writing so this helps me a lot and another struggle i have with writing novels i i very often reach mental squeeze points like nick used to say because in novels are very complex and you have the characters their background stories and yeah the places you write about there's so much information you have to bring together to have them a story in the end and yeah i very often get overwhelmed at some point with all this stuff and mocs really now help me to especially when i take breaks and come back to a novel project i can really see everything in one place and it's helping me a lot and what's also helping me is when i'm in the flow of writing i can really just use those links to make connections and so it really supports my flow in writing as well yeah and what is important for me as a writer is a good workplace a clean space and i love this picture of the matrix where morpheus has this white room i think people who saw the movie know this is just this clean space and he can just pull in what yeah he wants to show and work with and then he can push it out again afterwards and has always this clean space to start off from and this is very important for me as a creative person to have this kind of space that's why yeah i created my world in this way you will see soon and what's also very important to me is the control i'm kind of a control freak i really want to have the feeling of that i know where things are and yeah so that's why i at the beginning of the course thought i will always have my folders and not get rid of them at some point because i thought my folder structure is quite good i can show this to you how it looked like at the beginning i had like um folders according to my writing process so the first big part would be the non-fiction stuff so i had sources different folders for articles and everything and my own thoughts and then of course atomic nodes moses and then i would go and create blog posts from the mocs books workshops whatever and yeah here in this part you see the that i had for my novel projects i have several projects and every project would have in have a folder with subfolders and so i thought i will still need those folders but in unit 4 i decided to take the leap and try something new and so i will show you what my home looks like now or maybe i can even make it a bit bigger i have only three folders left and it's the first um palm tree is folder is my non-fiction stuff everything is in here then i have the templates in here and the third one is my fiction writing what i have here usually is that i have for each project a different emoji like for this novel for instance um when i open this this would be a home note for my novel coffee death and cigarettes so you can see each file that is here has the coffee cup emoji and then we have the different kinds of notes i can open this up a bit more like diary entries i have a novel diary for each novel and scenes or questions i need to answer and yeah and the home note is also the space that can really help me see everything in one place and yeah i mean i've just started doing this like two weeks ago so i will see um how this will go on i think those should be empty i don't know why they are here now and um yeah i feel like um this is a good way to sort my files because i actually don't want to go in here and look for something i will use different ways to search stuff like the search for instance i would use i would never go in there but i still have this feeling of some of order because i use the emojis so this really helps me a lot and so when i start my work day i will just have this home note and this clean space and i can just really go in here and i have some daily tasks that just will get me going and for instance my this is quite an interesting point as well because i know some people also have handwritten notes so what i do now is every day i go back to the day before and go through the handwritten notes from the day before and then bring in what is important to obsidian as well and just let me look at the time now it's still time i'm i'm talking so fast that there's still some time left and so what i really love about this um clean space because when i as a writer i just start to write very fast sometimes i just wanted to show and when i have ideas and even maybe links and create some new notes i can just have my yeah emojis there this would be my thought emoji oh i can also show you my emoji cheat sheet but what i was just wanted to show is that it's really easy for me to um yeah clean my space so when i have at the end of the day several notes here they show up here and i can just move them at the end of the day here and so i always have this clean space but i also to make sure i don't just put stuff in there i also have this open a random note and go back so i really want to stay in contact with everything i do i don't want to just throw stuff somewhere and never work with it again and i think what i like to do as well is go to the graph you can also see here the those are all my novel projects they are very separate from everything that's just because they are and this the big thing here is all the non-fiction stuff what i really like to do is also go here to the stuff here and see if i can make some connections so i really go also every day back to my notes and see if i can make new links and if i can delete something sometimes you also can delete stuff yeah and i have an emoji cheat sheet just to let me see yeah where i they also can quite see this is still again the um folder structure i had before this would be the fiction stuff so every novel would have a home note that will be seen with this triangle and the good thing is the triangle will always be on top of the notes so this is very good i think and yeah then you have the different kinds of notes of course and with the fiction i also have just like those um the sources the different emojis and diary dreams so everything is still there so even when i if i should decide ah this is too much for me i have to go back to some folders i don't know i will always find the stuff back and yeah but so far i have been using this for like two or three weeks now i'm really happy with it especially with this clean space i have here and i've always found everything i needed to find so so far with the amount of notes i have right now i'm yeah happy with the structure i have here thank you thank you anya let's give anya a round of applause yeah yeah was
