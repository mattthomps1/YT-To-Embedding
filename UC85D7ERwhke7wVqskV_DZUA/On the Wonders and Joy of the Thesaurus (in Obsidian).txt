why are words so amazing because with one word we can unlock a whole new world a whole new dimension of thought george orwell understood the power of language in his novel 1984 the big brother government enforces a language called newspeak that eliminates words they get rid of bad they get rid of great now there's just ungood and double plus good this brutal collapse of word choice imprisons our ability to express ourselves our ability to articulate the complex thoughts and emotions that we're having fast forward to today and who would have thought that we'd choose to imprison ourselves wearing our reduced vocabularies as some sort of badge of honor scared that if we start using the big words we'll somehow screw with our identity but without the big words in your back pocket it just makes it easier for big brother to screw with you so to combat that this video will explore the wonders and joy of using the thesaurus yes the thesaurus it will show you simple ways to use it and it will point you to a free publicly available resource but first some quick backstory last year i did a video about the book of connections which it was revealed was peter mark rojer's thesaurus established 1852 this particular version is the third edition of the 21st century edition now i was happy to share my enthusiasm for a book of words but then life moved on but just recently i received an email from a guy named dennis and in it he attached what he called a small gift it wasn't a trip to cancun it was just a bunch of words literally it was a digital version of the thesaurus the exact third edition thesaurus with the concept index in the back by barbara ann kipfer that i did my previous video on this gift i'm telling you it's one of the best gifts ever in the email from dennis he provided some stats on this digital thesaurus so let's talk about it 14 000 distinct notes with definitions 44 000 words in total all combining to create 420 000 distinct links when i opened this up i seriously had goosebumps for 10 minutes straight and now i want to share dennis's gift with you let's check it out all right so this is the background email from dennis 14 000 words 44 000 unique words so these 14 000 are the detailed descriptions that we have links to definitions within here and then we have 420 000 links all the way going around in different directions that's crazy so we can click on information or the inter information which gives us the introduction and all that but how do we use this thing so i want you to go to the word list and wow it took a second to load because it is massive so we look at how many words are in here and we're not talking paragraphs we're talking words that's huge so that's where the 14 000 is coming from i'm sure there's some extracurriculars like this that we won't count but um look at this it's insane so when you open the thesaurus and you're just doing it like tolkien right you're just wandering around where do you go where should we go so that's that's the great question where should we go and you might just click around for a little bit let's settle here and kind of see something aspirant aspirations a sale assassin assistant associate astonish so we click on astonish this looks pretty cool right what is nice about the digital thesaurus here in obsidian and obsidian publish is that you can hover over any of these and immediately you can see that definition hover over that one you can see this one over that one and it just goes and goes and goes which is quite a lot of fun but let's just check out what's happening in astonish okay it's a verb the v and it's basically it means surprise so what we want to see are the synonyms here amaze astound bewilder floor overwhelm throw a curve okay stupefy now what i want to direct direct your attention to is that these words have something cool and that's what in the uh physical version barbara and kipfer so excellently put together which i don't know blows my mind i would really like to find out how she did that but she relates this to a concept surprise so if we click on surprise we recognize at the top surprise is located within this meta note called actions of a cognitive nature okay so if we go back down to surprise actions of cognitive nature we can see astound is here but now we're not just looking at synonyms for astound we're looking at conceptually similar things to surprise that's kind of cool so backfire bedazzle bewilder confound now if we're looking at these words overwhelm ooh electrify that's a good one right i mean doesn't that does not just get the brain firing electrify animate astonish dynamize whoa this is cool uh but yeah check out some of these other ones alarm so astound isn't quite the same as alarm but they do share in common a sense of surprise whereas astound and let's say confound they are pretty i mean they would be under probably the synonyms as well so they're also related under surprise this is pretty cool right so one way to use the online digital thesaurus is very simply to just wander around ask yourself hey where should we go settle on a few words hover over them see where it takes you go down the rabbit hole might start out as a bunny trail but after a while we get to the rabbit hole and we really dig in deep when you go to a word then you can check out that word you can see what's related you can move laterally and look at the different synonyms or you can kind of go up a level kind of go up to the map of these words at the next level of emergence and check out the concepts that they share in common so if we're looking at flashback suddenly we can see the same level the different words on that level hallucination memory nostalgia or we can kind of go up a level and conceptually try to understand what is a flashback and you know what categories does that fit under and in this case we have remember and cognitive so with flashback let's try remember now again we're an action's cognitive something tells me this is probably a pretty big category we'll explore these a little bit more in just a second so under acton's cognitive remember surprise was 42 but it looks like remember is 40. and now what what are other things that are about remembering hindsight recollect remembrance reminisce retrospect block out okay kind of a non-remembering how cool is this right but just to recap why this is so valuable is part of what slows us down or trips us up is not finding the right word or being able to express what we're feeling the thesaurus helps with that it helps get us going gets us thinking the languages of humanity especially the english language isn't just 100 words it isn't just good or double plus good it can be 14 000 words it can be 44 000 words now that's a vocabulary that's shakespearean whoa if you're feeling like that's greek to me just know that there's a method to my madness and while brevity is the soul of wit it's not a wild goose chase to expand your vocabulary into a tower of strength because then well the world's your oyster think about how shakespeare could describe things in dramatic novel and penetrating ways now we won't get to his level but we can get a little bit closer and that's an admirable goal now what does having a vocabulary with a lot of words lead to it leads to an enriched way of thinking it leads to an improved analytical way of thinking a creative way of thinking and a connective way of thinking it allows us to parse the particulars to slice through the similarities and discern the subtle differences and definitions that's what a strong vocabulary can do that said please note that knowing a lot of big words doesn't mean we should always talk in big words but it does mean we can think better if we know more of them all right let's jump back in if you recall we were at the higher order note called actions of a cognitive nature and we were on remember so let's just jump back so if you go on the side you can go to the word list that's where we went the first time this time we're going to go to the categories this is a pretty cool thing i'm just kind of blown away that all of these words could be kind of tagged for lack of a better term under a few different categories that compile words in ways that their synonyms might not compile them and that's where a lot of these serendipitous encounters are happening and that's just a lot of fun okay so what's what's happening here the table of content the toc for categories lists all the different categories of how these words are arranged so not only is it here where you can just immediately click anywhere but we also have the outline of what we see over here and i just want to point out if we're familiar with folders it's in the file explorer sidebar and we can see the different categories here previously we were in cognitive land and these are all the different subdomains if you will underneath actions cognitive so let's hop back into that note we were in this should look familiar fact you know we were down here before with surprise and then remember let's just go up and see what else is going on believe right so let's take it back to the top we can go to categories we can see cognitive and believe is right here click on believe and we see that yes this is one of those cognitive actions and we can see other things that are related to a word like believe so that's quite interesting but where might we want to go you know let's we've looked at action's cognitive that doesn't have all of the words so what else is out here so if we look through this list we can see that we have actions that are general related to motion related to the physical and now we get into causes so we can fold actions now we're in causes abstract and physical causes we can fold that fields of human activity communications education entertainment family government health well just keeps going legal military which one of these do you want to click into where do you want to wander that's kind of the fun of this so i'm just giving you a little walk through letting you know what's available maybe you want to go into professions educator you know what's under educator academic alumnus alumna coach conductor cretan obnoxious stupid person where'd that come from so that's pretty cool that uh the way that this is compiled you know we also have some antagonistic uh words that are being compiled underneath educator so that's that's quite enjoyable i must say so we're going professions recreation religion sex and reproduction social interactions the arts i would be interested to kind of hop in there a little bit but let's close fields of let's fold fields of human activity now we're in life forms so we're still we're going down this list right life forms beans animals beans general characteristics humans so i'm just going to start scrolling now right plants now we're in objects articles that are physical buildings possessions clothing food and drink oh that's that's kind of interesting what would be under food okay appetizer bun casserole hors d'oeuvres pastry vittles that's that's one i'm not familiar with so that's pretty cool right now we're just kind of going down matter conditions of matter divisions of matter qualities of matter tools transportation qualities becomes its own category we have abstract qualities i bet you these are pretty big too comparable comparative qualities which i think might be a helpful kind of a sharpening stone for our thoughts when we're trying to earlier on we're talking about parsing out the particulars and sussing out the similarities this is the area for that where we can start to consider different work equivalents alike approximately balanced comparable so now with whatever we encounter throughout the day i can go into it and kind of consider well how was this thing that i encountered disproportionately this or that you know it's kind of hard to give you an example of this on the fly but they are helpful physical now we're into the senses oh my goodness for the sake of time let's just kind of go down to the bottom see where it ends at wholeness division weights and measures okay the planets we're going to dive in here the planet geography and now the subcategory land how many how many notes are we going to find here let's click in this was more than i was expecting what do we have patio savannah mountainous quagmire ravine trench tundra so these aren't just landscapes but they are ways to describe you could say the tundra it was cold you went to this meeting and it felt like a tundra right there wasn't any warmth there or uh you know you took a long walk it was like you're going through the savannah you know who knows but just saying these are ways to really activate and get our brains going right so this is really cool and uh i don't know i just get so now i wish i wish i could show this to my grandma i think she'd get a kick out of this she was always big into words and i think we'd have some fun together i'd punch the buttons and i don't know we'd just embark on a word journey a word excursion you know we'd probably only make it to three words before she started the next family story but ah that would have been fun right but let's continue on now the gift how awesome is it of dennis to have assembled and shared this amazing gift i mean it's priceless this is not available for download so don't ask but in the spirit of giving i want to share it with you online so i'm hosting a freely available public version on obsidian publish for you to use at any time see the link in the description below and then start your own word excursion and now the takeaways number one this is yet another amazing example of what's possible with linked-based thinking the thesaurus now in a digital format number two if we expand our vocabulary we can improve our thinking number three if we expand our vocabulary we have extra tools to defend against the dark arts of populists persuasionists and other bad actors trying to get you feeling angry scared or victim outraged and that is not to be underestimated in today's world and number four if we expand our vocabulary we can have more joy and enrichment with our interactions with other people along with our interactions with ourselves with whom we're forever stuck so we might as well enjoy our company remember here are some ways you can use the thesaurus number one go for a word excursion open the word list and just scroll and go number two use the concept index open the categories note and just scroll and go what's the common theme here well i think jrr tolkien said it best not all those who wander are lost so pull the anchor and set forth on an excursion into the unknown hey i hope you gained some value from this video if you did please give it a like and a subscribe so you'll know when there's more and there is certainly
