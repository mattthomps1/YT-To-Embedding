[Music] what are the steps to creating a map of content bogdan asked um there are a few steps uh and i want to talk about that because that's really important and i how did i miss this folders folders are top down so like if you always had to go to the home note before you did anything if you had to do that that would be rigid and it would be a top-down it is a top-down way of thinking we're working from a convergent convergent perspective and we're going into our existing knowledge with links with these link-based apps like obsidian and rome we now and before that the archive which is uh kind of the gold standard in my opinion by the guys at the zlcostan.de forum because that's like the most future proof it's very simple it's it's the luddite version of uh knowledge management but it's it's always it's always there for you so i want to give a shout out to those guys and the archive but because of you know because of links now we can do bottom up thinking bottom up allow ideas to just form and then naturally organically we make these connections okay so we have top-down thinking we have bottom-up thinking and then with maps of content we have the option to do this sort of middle-out thinking and and the best way that i talk about this right now is that where do i spend my time when i'm in my note library and i have to say the biggest revelation for my thinking has been spending most of my time in a map and i'll throw notes in there so i'll throw all these notes i'll throw them in a new map and then i'm i'm in colliding phase and because of that my i you know i say it's ideation acceleration you know think of the large hadron collider in switzerland it is smashing you know subatomic atomic particles together some of them merge to form a new note so to speak others fall away and these are these discarded notes but what's happening with that those type of collisions is this massive um massive work massive progress and i just find that this is the best way to go to get that done at the fastest rate at the funnest rate at the rate that has the most flow so if we go back to what are the steps to creating a map of content there are two ways you allow ideas to emerge naturally and then eventually you get to the point where you want to start i called the mental squeeze point you know you get to this mental squeeze point where you're about to become overwhelmed by whatever notes that you're working with and you need a way to work with them uh where you can offload the cognitive burden and this is perfect because i really want to add i'm going to come back to this note but right now i just want to make sure i get chunking in here because mental squeeze point and chunking are tightly related and why not let's just see what happens here let's publish this change and then eventually we'll we'll check it out in a couple minutes on the obsidian publish feature which is just so cool the point being though is when you're in your notes as you start to reach the mental squeeze point that's when you create a map of content or you know what you want to talk about already you have a preconceived idea right like um we want to get away from that all the time but there are still times where we think hey this is exactly what i want to talk about then i'll go in here and i'll make a new one from the start and i'm just trying to think of something something i'm going to be doing on the work in the workshop coming up is my cosmos moc where i force myself to watch the i'm joking force but where i re-watch the carl sagan cosmos series and the new one and try to pull out those those uh those wow moments that really have spoken to me and inspired me in in that sense of awe and wonder and so i i already know what i want to work on so i'm going to start with an moc and then just each episode will kind of be a heading and i'll put ideas underneath that and then they'll start pushing out to other places so the short answer is you can the steps are basically well i mean you just create a new note and then you you call whatever you want but how you get there is usually you start from a bottom-up sense of oh i don't want to forget what i'm talking about let me make a new map of content or you stop start from the top down and you say okay i'm just starting with this idea i know what the idea is let me start compiling notes here so those are the two ways that you can kind of approach it okay was this inspired by the dewey decimal system there is some inspiration here actually um especially like these these numbers here um what i here's what it what i like about the the dewey decimal system it's just that they're about uh 10 or so major categories like the the zeros here i'll let's just kind of dive into it so in this interest map of content this was this is sort of my catch-all of maps i'm interested in of topics i'm interested in so like in this light kit these are some other maps um some of these haven't really been created even in my main library and i but i want them to to be created at some point what's a good example of that greco-roman map of content you know just some of that those cultural elements eventually want to kind of compile them here but if we look at what's happening this is the dewey decimal system just modified and only at the at the high level so mv what i'm not doing is i don't want to get into decimals this is a personal aesthetic preference there's no reason not to other than when you start to get into decimals with your numbering over here you you just start to add a rigid structure that may not be necessary i i think at that point it gets a little less fluid so why use numbers at all well you don't have to the reason that i'm using some numbers for these home maps is just so that they sort so they sort to the top and they're always here i can always find them and that gives me a little bit of comfort as i use my knowledge but there's nothing special about these numberings i use three digits because this gives me some flexibility so everything starts with a zero and it can sort properly and then i can add like in between goals and personal knowledge management i added you know this one that was in between there's nothing i mean there's nothing special about it at all and then to answer your question more directly in this interest map of content which mv if you just go to the note here you can read a little bit more about using the dewey decimal system so i'm going to move on to the next one just real fast though i'm just curious if that chunky note made it trying to think the best way would i just link to mental squeeze point one thing that publish doesn't have yet but will is search so until until that shows up mental squeeze point let's talk about the mlc's intro mental squeeze point chunking it doesn't exist yet so when you publish it takes about 10 minutes is what i found for those changes to to take place next question can the five levels emergence levels be constructed with folders and links yeah well so frank asked this i would construct them with notes and links and that's what i've done here i'm not saying you can't use folders but but there is some rigidity that comes into it and it does mean that you'll be doing a lot more twirl downs um i try to avoid the twirls because this is buried information in fact that should jump in there but this is buried information um every time i have to twirl into something um and i only have this habit habits example as a space just for the light kit but in reality i wouldn't have this folder because i would just use a map of content but you might find for whatever reason some some desire to use this i think the spaces a good time to use that would be for you know my business or whatever and then you can kind of make sure that your business specific work that you know isn't sort of idea and interrelated you can have a special place for that but um the whole idea here is to use fewer folders now that we have the power of the link and um you know the the great folder rebellion is is upon us and many people went away from folders completely i i believe that folders still have a place but it's it's about the amount that we use it's about kind of lopping off a zero so if you had 100 folders let's let's take it down to like 10 folders then we're in the better range of you know proper use in my opinion all right let's keep going my impression is that a strong naming system pattern is necessary to maintain the whole thing living and fluid isn't it would it be possible to have some hints sure i mean this kind of i'll try to keep it uh brief a strong naming system is it key well no but there's a tendency to go in that direction and that's if we go back remember what you're doing is you're just you're just making a zettle cost in when you work with links because each note can then just link to other notes and if they're atomic in size if they're written in your own words then they're sure they're even more like a zettle constant but when i use that term i just kind of mean generally we're talking about small notes that are linking to other notes [Music] that's really all that matters when you get into the maps of content that helps you chunk information and helps it easier to recall and retrieve this information let's go back to your questions i'm answering it completely is it necessary to me maintain the whole thing and here's the beauty it's not necessary to maintain once you create it like up until yesterday i was working on a new tv show that's coming out on nbc called connecting so that means that i didn't have much time to be in my actual note library and that's the beauty of the maps is that i come back and already like i'm off to the races when i come back to my knowledge management i'm already jogging like you know i'm already in it and so you know how this works is when you make a new map what my best practice is that you relate it you connect it to you know somehow back to a home map and a good example of this is in mindsets and then if we go to habits so this whole habits note what did i do with this note because it's a map of content i like to have a cup like a link at the top so i just said you know habits is real what what home note home map does habits relate to let me connect that and that's what i did so i connected habits to mindsets and then mindsets if i click this breadcrumb takes me back to the home note so let's look at the graphic what's happening here this this is exactly sort of what's happening so habits right here is a map of content i created it's a new map but i want to kind of you know be able to find it quickly so i made sure that there's a link that exists within mindsets so in this way we've chunked information but we also allow for easy easy information to to flow and we can fly we can fly through the note library so that's not the definitive answer but hopefully that gives you some hints like you asked do you think you need to use a zealocaston id great question steve um you i don't think i need to i think there are there are places to definitely use it and i think your example here is a perfect place to use it so the question is when do you want to track information chronologically and so i can think of let me make this even bigger for people looking on their screens when would i want to do that for me it would be meetings we can consider this a meeting you know like personal tracking you know anything that's tracking logging is a perfect opportunity to to timestamp and why not use a that'll cost an id or you know maybe you you say that you don't really need that level of depth that's you know an aesthetic purpose and to a large degree it's an aesthetic purpose i understand that these little costume ids will never change um and that's that was sort of the beauty of them early on um like in the archive now with uh with rome and with obsidian links like file names auto update so if i were to change the home note um and just add some nonsense to the end of it then i can see that it was updated immediately as a backlink in all those files so i'll just take that back that kind of makes the the this specific timestamp as a unique id less valuable to me because i i believe that this auto updating file name is the new standard i expect it i feel comfortable in its future-proofness but if you don't then certainly use this for for all of your notes if we do feel comfortable then it goes to when do we want to track something chronologically and anything like that is a perfect place to add you know some sort of time stamp something like that okay let's see and 42 okay this is try to fly through a little bit faster let's see do you consider it appropriate to describe in the home page and mlc not only the relationships between entities but also the purpose of their existence so that you can periodically check the clocks describe it in the whole notes not only the relationship the purpose of their existence um yeah i think so um i would say like in the home note this is this is me describing the purpose of this map of content at the top so i'll try to yeah i'll try to have something like that let's see what i did in mindsets i well i want to so it's kind of like a launch pad into like where i want to dial in my my focus concepts [Music] well concepts is sort of its own thing writings okay so here's that purpose again this is where you find your writings and creations of all flavors so am i answering i think i'm answering the purpose of their existence so yeah anywhere i can i will absolutely add that information because that's future proofing i i think what you're getting at is that how can we future proof this for ourselves so when we come back however years later to this note do we remember why why we're using it so yeah i try to absolutely future proof in that way how long does it take for someone to develop all five levels well that's a great question and and i i'll just go back to starting like this cut that out so just make a home note you can have you should have level five right now it just shouldn't be unearned structure that's the real key is and i have to say this for a lot of people like myself who have a tendency to want to um over organize and i imagine many of us if we're on this call are are similar in that boat so that's that's my biggest warning with the light kit when you look at these five levels everyone just wants to create you know the structure at the top but it's unearned it's unearned until you have enough stuff bubbling up and you you know you feel mental squeeze points and then you're like oh okay i do need to create a new note or excuse me a new map of content there is an exception to this because we all weren't born yesterday so i think i made note of this okay so if we can dial into this little section here since you weren't born yesterday you may already have some ideas for home maps right i mean you've already done emergence it might just not exist in your actualized notes so you know you can you can attempt to add you know a couple home maps at the start just be aware uh be very uh afraid of over structuring too soon like structure needs to be earned but yeah i encourage you to start with at least one start with your home note and put at least one map of content in there and just get the sense of things i mean these are really some strange categories if you think about it it's not as simple as like um you know physical it could be or projects and that could be too i actually have projects down here the point being though is these are the the categories that have earned a place in my dashboard and so you know you just want to make sure it's it's earned over time frank asked does one start with emergence or emergence one does one start with emergence five oh okay well yeah this is the great question do we start with bottom up or top down until recently you had to start with top down folder folder-based file systems on the mac and windows basically forced us to always be thinking about structure first but now we have the the fluid fluidity to think wherever we want to and where you know i roll out of bed this morning and uh you know maybe i talked to somebody er i was talking with steve about uh oil and water hey that's a cool concept let's roll with that and that's emergence level one or you know um we're talking about concepts some sort of like high level concept and i kind of want to think of it from my concept map so i'll start in the map and then i'll be like how can i work in this new one how can i work in chunking where should i put chunking you know something like that so you can go in either direction um how do you use tags i am torn between using first of all like tags is always always that area that's a tricky one so let's let's see where we go here i'm torn between using general tags i'm going to make this even bigger for everyone [Music] on a note in order to easily find them in the future but also concerned that general tag might be related to hundreds of notes yeah this is a extremely valid concern it's um [Music] i think and i the real concern with tags is over tagging because every time that you you tag something you do dilute the value because instead of having 100 notes with a tag if if you have like a thousand and then you search if you search that tag your results are pretty muddy now i mean there are workarounds and a good example of that if um you know if i i'm just trying to think of a good example if i search source let me collapse results so i have a certain amount of notes let me make this a little bit easier to look at but if i add a second one like commentary then that list goes down so i mean there is a way to very easily to to kind of filter by using more tags and everything the only thing that um so so i think they're an extremely powerful tool and the way to look at them is remember i said earlier a link is just a relationship by another name tag is a relationship by another name it's just a weaker relationship right you're just kind of saying like hey these two notes are they have the same hobby that they're interested in whereas a link is saying they are related like they're blood relative essentially um so i think yeah the tags are really valuable the only the only thing is don't you can get in the trap the the the trouble of over tagging just like hey can wha what could this possibly relate to so it's important to to define how you want to tag like descriptor tags um in my home note i try to show like i show right here that my most important ones and then if we jump into a note like writings you know i show other ones that i can use so when in doubt i use that top down fluid home note to direct me on how should i be tagging my writings like okay yeah yeah this is a journal um what else is it uh oh eventually i published something well journal and output wouldn't really go together but journal maybe it's a letter too maybe it's a letter i wrote to somebody personally so then these two go together but this allows me to understand these home maps what tags have i kind of validated i want to be using you can go crazy with descriptor tags so just be careful because you don't want to make them less useful by overtaking everything this one is this started with a bottom-up approach or top-down gray gas so the light kit started i mean my note started from i mean it really just informed each other over time because i mean originally it was in evernote and then i went plain text envy notational velocity into the archive into now um obsidian and so it's had a mixture of uh sort of like top down like notebooks thinking but over time it's become more bottom-up but as these notes start to connect then the top down starts to to push back and so now now there's this nice heteroarchaeal structure which is like sometimes you know this these notes are more dominant than than these notes but that it changes it has that fluidity to it but there's still structure i mean i in my mind i picture an amoeba sort of how it can kind of like span expand and change its shape hopefully that answers it it's not a there's not a direct way it was started so i covered the idea behind the numbering which is it's fairly arbitrary but for me it just helps for sorting and i covered why three digits i i just have to say it again don't over number i mean there's such a the habit to like over structure over number and it's really the i think i would my opinion is the wrong way to to look at the issue in your use case how many folders are too many um 10 no there's no like number but that being said i i think again it's about whatever you whatever you're used to to remove a zero so if you're used to 100 take it closer to 10 and then you're you're in the right ballpark if you had a thousand well hey just take it down to 100 and you'll be good how many tags are too many um i wouldn't look at it that way because [Music] they allow you uh some fluidness when you are you know thinking about how things are connected so it's okay to have just a few that are around for some reason you decided there was value so i'm not too worried about having too many tags okay different communities that talk about zettlecoston gardens evergreen notes vaults all that good stuff well yeah i mean i'm not a part of all of the communities but the communities that i've used the most have been the zettelcostin.de forums but most most recently has been the obsidian discord and the obsidian forum by far those have been my most trafficked lately do i keep previous versions of mlcs in case i want to go back i keep previous versions of outputs so not necessarily mocs because in my opinion the mlcs should naturally be evolving and i'm okay with that but let's see if there's a good example of sure if i linked back to it so well without showing too much this is another library of mine uh try to hide this a little bit but if you see my pkm story and in the links section let me close this so i have some metadata at the top i didn't prepare this so let's see but i gave it a b01 that means it's a different version for me and i decided to keep my a01 so i i'll just append something simple like that i picked that up from the zedlcaustin.de forum years ago and i'm not saying it's the best method but it's just something that kind of works for me so every new letter denotes a new kind of substantial iteration of that and if i want to keep the old one i can just do something like this and you can do the same thing for a map of content in your case if you wanted to keep the old one for whatever reason yeah just just um give it a little uh append append num name or number how necessary is it to add numbers to before file names and maps of content specifically for the major ones found in the home note it's not necessary at all it's just a personal preference i like how if i use the file explorer i they can sort to the top because i always just sort by file name a to z but it's totally not necessary if you break a note into two pieces or sub notes do you keep the original note 2 as separate or do you edit that too i won't keep the original note um because i 90 of the time 95 percent of time i won't keep the original note because that's the beauty of evergreen note making is that i can keep aspects of of the note i'm trying to think of a good example what was that there was something i had mentioned about someone on twitter called out some study i mentioned was maybe not valid what was that about and uh and instead of deleting my note on this questionable study i just added to the note some people questioned this study you know basically it was that so that note gained in value and you know and i i delet you know deleted this section and slice that section however if you did want to keep the original note then yeah do that same thing just um you know append it with you know a version conversion thing i might use something like a01 b01 and yeah there you go what do you do about being too lazy to write down interesting ideas you come across hey that's really the beauty here uh so back in the light kit all i have to do hotkey command n or control n and then i'll be like oh yeah yeah new idea okay and i hit it again and say new idea two and say you know i'm lazy but come back to this and then i can give it you know some sort of i use boat which is like this thing but i could also just say seed and then i have a couple avenues back or i can also append it and add tk here which means to come all i'm doing is it's giving me a way to access this again you can use whatever tag tells you that you know you can then search it and like okay these are the notes that i need to work on um or you're in let's let's keep going with this or you're in new how just see a new idea you're in this new idea and as you're typing along you come across a concept while you're typing but you're too lazy to to too lazy or too occupied to work on it so i just say new idea four but i don't have to create it so then in this uh graph view you can see that it's a different color which is just a little bit of css magic and i can see oh this is an idea that i need to get to because it's not created but i but i linked to it so there you go [Music] [Music] you
