can you share thoughts on the prefixes razadon asked [Music] okay razvan so the prefixes so when you sort by file name you can be assured that these prefixes will always sort at the top that's the reason that i use these basic numbers number two is if i open up a quick search which in obsidian it's command o on the mac then i can just really quickly do like o2 oh zero two zero and there's concept right there and click on that so it's an easy way in fact if i just hit zero i have my most recent um home maps all right there so if i just hit 000 i'm at my home note that's really nice these never change and so although this whole thing is fluid this provides somewhat of a spatial constellation that i can rely on oh i'm feeling a little scattered where do i go oh okay i know what to do just scroll to the top and click back on the home note it's it's home base it's home for a reason patrick i already have the imf kit nick mentioned the light kit would add to the imf how do the two kits interact the light kit replaces the imf kit that if you already have the imf kit what this webinar is is serving as two purposes to show you some practical hands-on ways to use it and two to really like hey patrick dive into these home maps because each one organizes information in a different way the interest map of content here is based on the dewey decimal system with a few personal augmentations and then i have other maps linking here check out the the people right so common tags that i use and then you know different different ways to structure how i interact with people in my personal knowledge management system so that's really where you want to go to get the whole advantage of the difference of the light kit luis asks how do you use your calendar in obsidian honestly i don't if you do project management if you do a lot of task management which i deliberately avoid doing in obsidian then you would want to take advantage of your calendar that being said uh that's why i included it for for you in the light kit you can there's a lot so here's the link to the calendar mlc there was a tremendous amount of work that went into linking all this stuff some i grabbed from others on the forums and others i did manually point being is i just wanted to do the work for for you and give you the option of figuring out how to incorporate the calendar okay really going to scroll through here if you don't use folders how do you search for them in a giant pool of singular notes to link in moc by searching by for titles or filtering by tags there are boolean search rules already available edgar and um that being said what i would do like hey i am let's say i'm in the bottom up mode where i'm creating things from scratch and i'm creating them really fast tag them like with whatever your your temporary or long term tag is but like let's say it's on you know the cosmos so i'll use the tag cosmos and then i'll quickly you know make 20 notes and then when i'm coming back to review i'll just hashtag cosmos i'll look at those notes and if i haven't already created an moc but then i can start to make sure i don't forget any of those notes right that's part of your question how do you make sure that you don't lose those notes i can't believe everybody is uh still around this is pretty wild um do you find useful to use tags such as idea concept book tags that define what the note represents yeah i do and that's from carlos so carlos i do find that useful and idea is one that you'll have to to define yourself um i show you how to define concept and and some examples that i use in the like it and then yeah i use book as well it's just pretty simple and you know books or books they're like a books are a very clear object right books will never be people but you know a book is by a person point being is a book is a pretty safe tag to use that's what i'm trying to get at joel hey i hope you're you're still around thank you so much for the question what are the advantages of using a home link everywhere rather than just opening the file you're looking for with with the quick switcher and taking advantage of auto completion that's a good question and honestly the advantage is a personal one and your mileage may vary so let's go back to the habit example so i have these top links and this one goes to mindset goes to home do we need those we don't we don't need any of this front matter linking the reason i use it is because i find it to be helpful to bounce around and i also think and i don't have the the scientific data to back this up or i just haven't like found and assembled it but i am a believer in repetition like improving any skill i believe in reps and as minor as it is i believe in the value of of if i'm at my habit moc of being able to jump back whatever i consider back and above and for me that's the mindset moc so yeah i could just have it go to home or i could just use the quick switcher but what i'm trying to do is you know create this sort of amoeba-like fluid framework structure in my own mind and and that's kind of why i use these front matter links additionally i do like just kind of clicking around quickly i do think there's somewhat of an advantage with that but to your point no functionality is lost ooh so is linking your thinking the complete opposite of progressive summarization well i'll be i'll be um political on this one i got into a little bit of heat because i went a little bit too strongly against progressive summarization there is certainly value to it what i want to get at is that you hm how can i best put this we are in the age of the lynx note do you want to be a note taker or a note maker which one do you think makes more value creates more value note making creates more value not just for other people but for yourself like that's that's you thinking and working on ideas so note making is more valuable progressive summarization is more on this note-taking side of things where you know you're you're highlighting and bolding and sure this is valuable you should do this but i'm just saying like if there's a spectrum this is you know um a line graph and you know this total value is 100 percent progressive summarization should not be 70 of what you do it shouldn't be 50 in my opinion it should be closer to like 10 or 15 and that means that 85 is dedicated to the progressive ideation you know the note making side of things so that's truly like i mean that's probably the best simplest way to think about it whatever you're doing if you're a progressive summarizer whatever you're doing minimize and life will be better because that means you're spending more time creating real value both for yourself and for anybody that you're sharing this information with side note any conversation that you enter is you sharing that value with other people so it doesn't have to be a blog it doesn't have to be an article this work in note making informs your every conversation let that sink in that's powerful um anonymous asks i am new to pkm would light be appropriate for things like reference material work projects people management or only knowledge notes that's a great question so i use it for reference material i use it mainly for knowledge notes as you know and i use it for people management not not excessively but i love the like i love what it can do with the people management i also use it for work projects um the entire light workshop was created in in obsidian using you know the linking you're thinking methods of maps and how these maps relate so i use it for projects i use it for people management what i don't do is i don't use tasks i don't worry too much about any project management task management any g d gtd you can do all this with with linking your thinking just me personally i know where i derive joy i know where i create value and it's not through through that process i hope that gives you some clarity but you absolutely can accomplish any of this project or task management using this framework and that's the beauty of the linking your thinking framework with maps and this home note is that it's completely fluid is completely customizable to your situation what i'm trying to show here is how you can take advantage of that because when you go from folders to links you have to kind of change how you think about things joel another question how atomic should notes be your notes often seem like short essays with a lot of subparts when do you think they should be broken up uh great question and there's no simple answer for that i kind of i prefer thinking about the principle of atomicity how it works for me that it doesn't have to be like an idea or like a sentence or two but that it can be more like a page maybe like half a page that's kind of my personal rule of thumb i think the concept notes do a good example of showing ideas around that so like here's anti-fragility there is a specific way i'm structuring this that i go over in the workshop but i like to start with something like this at the top um some basic ideas and and this really doesn't have my personal thoughts other than my bulleted thoughts so let's try to go into another one yeah so what i'm trying to get at is everything i see here is on one page and i don't have to scroll that's kind of my rule of thumb but there are there are definitely other notes that i have to scroll like evergreen notes that's a huge huge thing so on this one yeah i do have some scrolling um but even so it i don't have to scroll too much um and then if we click on some of the notes it goes to these can be pretty short so the answer is i don't know not a clear answer but i hope i hope it's helpful [Music] [Music] you
