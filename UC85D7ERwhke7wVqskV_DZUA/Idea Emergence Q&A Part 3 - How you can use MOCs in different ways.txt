[Music] folders also seem to be very important for selecting the items to be published hey great point i didn't even consider that angle uh absolutely so well i think i don't know what to add to what you said because that's just so important is if you are publishing then you'll want to consider how how folders are connected a good example of that is in my broader note library which is just this underscore n for note but here's that light kit it's not the exact light kit that you're looking at but it is the intact light kit so i always have access to it um and like if i twirl that down we see everything so if i just share this folder then all this other stuff is still private all these other notes are still private how do you differentiate between a map of content and table of contents oh sorry is like available for download yes it is hopefully it's in the chat description um i think daniel can also reprovide it thank you daniel how do you differentiate between mlc and table of contents you know i am so happy that this was question 29 and not like you know question one that means that we're all learning this language together and we're really far advanced already point being is um a table of content i would talk contents i would consider more of a finalized publication almost like a map of content is a super fluid place i mean think of google maps if you go to google maps and you type in starbucks you get this augmented perspective on top of wherever you're looking with points to starbucks and that's sort of a map of content and then you know you can manipulate this data in interesting ways depending on what you want to find a table of contents however isn't meant to in my um vantage point a table of contents is when you're ready for that book when you're ready for the article when you feel like i'm not changing this any longer then it kind of becomes it can kind of morph into a table of contents in that way how can mlcs help a tertiary student write an essay for a university class carl i'm going to to reference what we did with joel's question because i think that's probably the best i don't remember what i called it because i was just oh there it is yeah so i think you you might consider you know a top-down perspective let me make sure i got your question correctly yeah so if you know your essay or you have an idea of essays eventually you should create a note a map of content around the essay and just start seeing where where your notes are gather your existing notes see where the gaps are uh yeah because you might be like ah there really should be an argument here that i don't have and just kind of start with this then you can start actually creating the actual piece that would go out somewhere um a good example of that i don't want to share too much out of this one but so yeah so i just did this uh youtube video why obsidian will overtake rome getting a thumbs up there but yeah so this is not an atomic node this is my outputs and i just have this little metadata at the top with output but what am i doing here i'm writing like this is just me writing and that's that's all it is but i've pulled all these ideas but i think something that's important to for for people who actually want to output and share things is once you get to this thing that you want to share i don't know if you should have a million links to it because you're pulling from what you've already created and that's that's what i that's what i did here now i i have this notes overflow that kind of will have links for me but this information and if i do have links i'll want to add i could probably add a few more links to the metadata section but what i'm trying to get at is once you get to okay i've made my map which we looked at i made this awesome map of my essay then you got to get you convert it to output stage keep the map and then reference it so in this in this scenario i would reference it right at the top sorry this is zoom windows in the way and i would it's not in this library but i would put it right here let's let's imagine this was my map and now it's there for my resource as i'm writing my output and it's always those two things are always connected that way so if i open up my little i'm in too many different maps so but yeah they're always connected point being hopefully that's helpful do all of your evergreen notes connect to a map of content that's a really good question no i think it'd be nice if eventually a lot of them did because i look at them as little um waypoints you know imagine like if you had to imagine we were in the future and we could jump and make 30 jumps to go from one galaxy to another or one solar system to another so we're like we're bouncing around and each of those bounces are kind of like entering into a map of content or another metaphor is imagine there are these big house parties where all of these notes have gathered people having conversations and by click you can jump into a different house party that's kind of how i also can view a map of content and that means it's easier to find an evergreen note but because if there's just islands floating around somewhere you can find it but it might be hard to to to make that happen 32 i've seen brian jenks oh yeah he's a great guy discussing the idea of links to empty non-existent notes as a form of tagging yeah no i i love that concept i think i have let's go to the graph view and existing files only let's get rid of that let's make this a little bit more viewable don't pay attention to this calendar thing but um we're looking for purple purple notes so that's not included in the light kit what's a good example ah thought unpacking that's a term that means something to me let's keep going to a better concept point being is i can see these notes that haven't been created and then immediately work on these notes um i have a graph the graph view video on youtube is probably my best uh demonstration of how to use non-created notes and different things to to really spot what you can work on in a hurry and and then yeah then you can just ping out to ideas and not even touch them it appears all your notes you keep all your notes and a central vault is that correct um all my notes in a central fault yes no well not all my notes i have my uh the archive library that i'm slowly integrating into the obsidian library which it requires um kind of like i don't know the funnel where everything pinches down and then it enters into the new library so that stuff is waiting for me to process but it's still accessible and that's that was this one so i just need to kind of make sure that that data is is appropriate for entry um so i have a like i would say i have three volts i have the light kit i've my working notes and then i have my archived notes that i'm slowly bringing in and i prefer just to be down to two just this public kit and my personal kit if i could help it although for the workshop we're going to have a vault which is how we're all connected as people and talk topically it's it's really going to be a cool way to for us to get to know each other and to understand like oh who else used a space photo in their introductory message on in the chat group and kind of understand like where our interests are aligned daily task management is a burden to me can the light kit help mark asks you know it can but this is where i'm i'll i'll be straight with you is i try my best to keep task management and idea management separate and uh and i think it's because task management has low basically no long-term value and idea management does we can grow these ideas we can evolve just like growing a human being who is growing throughout life we we gain texture and flavor and that's why the idea management resonates and why i don't want to muddy that with with task management so it it's my it's my feeling that you don't want one app to rule them all you want to keep obsidian separate from or i should say whatever you're using for idea management separate from task management not to say it can't be done we can always explore that later too because i you know a lot of people have the same question that you have so we should explore it and we should figure out best practices mike asks so note titles reflect the level of emergence the note belongs to oh you know you you certainly can you certainly can put that in the in the note title i guess i do have that shown a little bit like the moc is obviously it's a higher order note but i don't um how else can i put it and then i can also like if a note's not created oh what's a good example i need to jump into well let's just say like in the example where i created a note here like if i create a non i'm not going to actually create this note so garbage but if i add a little tk or something i'm not creating the note but if we look here we can see it exists as an uncreated note so in the file name this is to come in publishing terms i that that's another reference for me but i guess you know some of these notes i don't know yeah i guess they're all basically evergreen so more or less yes and if you want to go above and beyond i think it's um if you love emojis you can actually put like hey the little sapling emoji icon for any notes that are just like barely started and then you can create like the evergreen icon for your evergreen notes you can get really colorful with with that i haven't i've seen people that do it and i'm like a little jealous on the inside but also i feel a little like it's not as future proof for my purposes because i don't i'm not comfortable with emojis and like searching for them so but yeah that's a that's actually a astute observation there does anyone okay so we're on the home stretch i'm going to try to get this done in 10 minutes um does anyone have knowledge of the timeline for mobile obsidian apps uh no no knowledge here i know it's not going to be like this fully fleshed out app but it will be a place that you can access your information if you go to the light kit and just check this out it gives you a flavor of what that mobile app might look like just in how it functions how how quick it is so that's something to check out what's the difference between spaces and vaults george asks spaces is a term that i just chose to to put here but it could be you know you could actually call this projects or projects and then decide that that's where you want your your projects to to be or you could call it workspaces or whatever you know and that's where it's important to get a sense of information that you do not mind having somewhat siloed somewhat uh separate from the rest of your your your information because you know to access that you'll have to click into it to see everything um since if you're still around right now i feel like maybe i can show you a little bit more from this other kit so in my personal notes in spaces so i have light like this is sort of a new venture for me well it is so let me it's a little messy in here but i have website and then i have you know different uh written notes of things and i know that these notes while they reference outside opinions and articles and everything that they that that they i don't mind having them here so i can just always find them and that's in you know my spaces section so if you feel like you want to silo knowledge for whatever reason that's a good time to to use spaces and then vaults is like you really really really don't care to have overlapping information so spaces is kind of like a soft border because it's a folder as opposed to vaults which is a definitely a hard order [Music] [Music] you
