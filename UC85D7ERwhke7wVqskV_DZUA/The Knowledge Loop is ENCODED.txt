okay we're going to do another kind of walk through it's not handheld this time but i'm going to be talking more about this process which is the knowledge process and it's part of a greater and more general knowledge loop okay so let's get started this is our world each of us has a world like this and when we were growing up our world what we thought was the world it was just us and it seemed like everything like one dot of everything as we mature and as we make connections and relationships with our family and friends we recognize that there are others but they still seem really close to kind of us so this is where that loop of knowledge starts there's encounters that we have and we express ourselves which then shape the encounters that we have and we get that process now over time we get a little bit more of an individual sense of ourselves however true or false that is we start to see a separation between us and the others around us so what happens if we embrace this is that there's a bigger space between encountering and expressing things so let's go back to this and that's where between encounter and expression we can create a space where we can get thinking in and so let's go up to see what that looks like so that's where we have others at this virtuous loop you us and then back to others we encounter something we then express ourselves that expression changes and shapes future encounters those encounters change us so this is the knowledge loop it's based on simple cause and effect we really can't escape it and if we're so lucky when the situation calls for it we can create a little bit of space between stimulus i'll hold this up again between uh stimulus over here and response we can open up a space and in that space is what we're looking at here a space to think and it turns out especially in the 21st century thinking is uh it's valued we can get a lot out of thinking who would have thought right so at this point i want to point out something there are two processes here there's the knowledge process and then on the bottom here there's the becoming process now for the most part we're going to stick to talking about the knowledge process and we'll we'll go further in different videos so that is the knowledge loop and it's composed of two different parts and what's really cool and hidden within the p cam planet the thing that i think was released to the public in a video over a year ago is this process it's been there the whole time so we have inputs we think about things and we have outputs and then we have the stuff that helps drive drive our future inputs and again there's a video that talks all about the pkm planet so i won't boris too much to death here but what's really fascinating about this is that when we start as a child this is our world our planet it's this dot it's everything then we can break it apart we can troubleshoot it we can make a diagnostic breakdown of it like we'll see later in this video but in the end the pecan planet just becomes your world again and if we really want to zoom this thing out your world it's the same thing it's everything but we're just breaking it down because if we break it down we can become better and that's the idea here is that once you know how the knowledge process is encoded that's an acronym it becomes clear how you can improve yours so let's break this down into something practical so before this video is over you're going to have something practical that you can leave with some questions that you can ask yourself to see which of these areas you might be able to unstick yourself just a little bit so now let's look at that acronym this is the knowledge process and the becoming process and it forms the knowledge loop it is encoded e is for encounter note is for noting things that you come across connect is c o organize develop is d e is express so that forms the word encode and then all of that is driven by our final d very a lot of different factors i will cover that in a different video on the becoming process so this is encoded and that is the knowledge loop the same simple loop i want to show this one more time this is the knowledge of loop two right information touches us and then based on that information we react and then we have new information that's all it is that's all this is the knowledge loop is encoded and what's cool about that is then we can break it down to really simple language what happens in the encounter phase of knowledge we can just say something what we say all the time hi that's it hi hello hello new idea hey let's have a conversation hello person let's have a conversation whatever it is and then when you stumble across something with the n note what does that mean i'll make note of that oh i'll take a note there what do we say we might not say it out loud but what we're saying is that's interesting so an encounter we say hi and then in note we say that's interesting now what typically happens most the time we're speeding across speeding through our days so quickly we may not have time to really sink our teeth into all the thinking that we can open up a space for and sometimes that's fine but when it becomes this chronic bypass of deep thinking then we get into this surface level weak thinking we kind of atrophy our thinking muscles and it's not good so what typically happens there is that we say hi that's interesting i feel hi that's interesting i feel and we just don't get any depth from that process so that is sort of a chronic problem that we're witnessing i would say in this century but probably in any any century and it's really up to us to open up that space right here and spend a little bit more time in the thinking mode of it all so the other direction you can go and say hey that's interesting and then connect it that reminds me and then you're connecting whatever that conversation is you're having with someone or the article that you're reading the book that you're reading and you connect that you say that reminds me of when i was growing up and my grandma did this or when i read this other book that had a similar concept or this experience i had with a friend just recently you connect it to something and this is where the sense making really happens and then you might say and that's related to and that's related to or you might say and that's part of and then with that framework you get to the develop phase and you say oh wow that means and you start to connect things that you never would have connected before when you just skip from that's interesting to i feel not to say that we shouldn't do that half the time in our day but there's another large chunk of time where we can sink a little bit deeper into really important subjects and thoughts then we can grow those thoughts over time okay and so this is the top part that we're focused on which is the knowledge process and that's part of a bigger bigger loop that we're talking about okay now i want to give you questions and prompts that you can take with you for each of the process this is really a framework so it's the encoded framework and what you can do is use it as a framework but now we're kind of going to use it as a diagnostic tool a self-diagnosis tool to say hey where where am i stuck here and so here are some of the questions that you can ask yourself in the encounter phase where am i encountering information where am i encountering information and you might say i like that i don't like that i can change this i can't change that right now ask this question write about it think about it what's the next question well in the note noting phase where you know what's interesting ask yourself hey what's signal to me what is high quality signal to me what is noise how am i filtering that difference and then in the connect phase hey that reminds me of this is if you take anything away from this this is the most important prompt i believe and then some of the prompts that you can follow here are am i sticking new knowledge to existing knowledge am i building upon my past knowledge two questions there what about the organized phase do i have a place to put things am i able to scale my system so my knowledge compounds in value so these are you know subjective it's not like a yes or no but you have to really ask yourself these questions what about the develop phase this is where i think the least work is done our society for even with knowledge workers i think the le the least amount of work but the most joyful work is in the develop phase and that's where you start to make these connections because you're connecting ideas you're organizing and so really these are all kind of plain at the same time and i haven't said this earlier this isn't a linear process and it's not a step-by-step process a lot of these are tunes are instruments and they're playing in harmony with each other so when we're developing things it's typically because we're organizing them and that's typically because we're organizing them by maybe connecting them in certain ways so ask yourself am i making leaps of insights am i seeing the patterns am i colliding ideas and am i enjoying this that's a big one what about express okay so where where am i able to express myself where are you doing that are you at all are you stuck are you am i emotionally constipated if i share my thoughts will they be treated with respect that's an important one and if that is an issue where you're stuck it's going to be really difficult to want to do any other aspect of this so any of these areas are things that if you get stuck you're not completing a healthy knowledge loop but what's empowering is all you have to do is figure out how to get unstuck and work on that area typically i'll find that it's in well knowing what signal knowing what's noise not capturing everything but then really spending time here in the sen in the land of sense making truly last thing i want to show is that this whole thing is a diagnostic tool with exercises so the knowledge loop is what we're looking at here this is you can't see my hands but this is the knowledge loop we're just moving around the loop and we want to really focus on this framework called the encoded framework we can ask our questions which is then when we use it as a diagnostic tool but we can take it further and leave with practical exercises with each stage of the encoded framework and that's where i think this is kind of powerful for one i mean the loop is happening whether they're my terms or somebody else's so the loop is happening we just want to make sure that we can feel in charge of it so that we're on top of the world and the world is not on top of us so what does that look like well there's an exercise for each of these i left a couple of these kind of hidden but the ones that i want to point out is creating a spark list so you can recognize those things that resonate with you that's like pop you just know oh i love that and that you you light up when there's somebody mentioning something related to that thing so one of the exercises that we're doing in the upcoming workshop is creating the spark list the bread and butter of linking your thinking truly is this exercise which is all about the seven c's of note making and that's a process that i want more people to be aware of but in due time then to continue the note making there are the 11 c's of map making so this is really what next level linked based digital notes allows us to do we there are unintended consequences and these are kind of hard to talk about until you feel comfortable with linking knowledge and you can do it fast enough but when you get when you become comfortable enough and you become fast enough what happens is we really break the sound barrier and we get closer to being able to work at the speed of thought and when that happens when you can get through mach 1 and you get close to the speed of thought this activity of map making is not only organizing you're developing you're really thinking at another level at that higher level but you're it i can't i can't give it justice right now but uh it's pretty exciting and then there are other exercises i won't talk about the home note or a couple of the ms of outputs some of this stuff is for later but there is a process here so the goal when you leave this video is that you ask yourself these questions where are you stuck in the knowledge loop then diagnose yourself and spend a little bit more time if it isn't developed then just zoom in on these questions and make it happen here zoom in on these questions spend some time to answer those questions as best as you can then your loop will be a little bit smoother the better that you can go through this loop the better insights that you'll have the more confidence that you'll have with the new ideas that you encounter you'll feel more comfortable with how you express them and i think it'll gain you give you clarity and a process that you can rely on so i guess i'm curious do you want another video like this we started with this an actual hand drawing and then we took a little bit further with this version and we we really focused on the knowledge process which is at the top of the knowledge loop there's also there's also the becoming process do you want me to talk about that i don't know if you if you do let me know in the comments below more so i'm even more curious which of these questions which of these prompts are the most empowering for you your feedback is really helpful so really appreciate that hopefully you got a lot out of this and i will see you on the other side
