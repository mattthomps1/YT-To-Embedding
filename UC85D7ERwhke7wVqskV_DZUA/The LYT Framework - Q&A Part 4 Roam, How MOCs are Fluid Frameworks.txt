dimitri do you have experience with the brain the brain was really cool i think it's still a really cool program it's a little bit too proprietary for me it's a little bit too hard to write notes in it but as far as a visualization tool um it was a lot of fun i'm a fan of the brain i wish i kind of had a reason to use it but it just just never worked oh kenny kenny's got one do you what do you not like about rome can you apply light using rome okay um i'll be careful with this one as well i will say this about rome it is so powerful it is the the most powerful databasing um machine out there that i know of for for the common person what i find is that our tools shape us evernote it encourages you to be a hoarder to to collect information ulysses and bear they encourage you to write rome encourages you to connect ideas that's the beauty i think it might also encourage you to become a databaser i don't know how i feel about that so what about obsidian obsidian also encourages you to be a connector but instead of a databaser it encourages you to be a writer that's the big difference that's the big difference for me because i want to write i don't want to database you know i think we can get caught in this idea of janitorial work of making a million links and tags so then you know you use these these tags and you rely exclusively on backlinks and it's great it's great when you have a hundred five hundred maybe even a thousand two thousand notes i think you're pushing it at about two thousand though uh real notes um because then when you hit one of these tag tag links and it's titled blog and you try to scroll through all of these daily notes um you know like 200 daily notes that you you put blog because you have ideas for this blog well how useful is that how useful is blog when you have to then scroll through all this information to try to find the one thing you're looking for so i think i think we have yet to see some of the pkm scaling issues of of typical rome usage now that being said you can use the linking your thinking framework in rome and i think that can alleviate a lot of the problems for me i mean obsidian because i'm a connector writer as opposed to connector databaser that makes more sense for me but but rome being as powerful as it is you can apply the frameworks of map of contents maps of content and a home note to rome and that you'll get a lot more value out of it that way in the long term uh joel some people in the pkm space seem to have the tendency to toss notes of clippings of text written by other people into their graph view vault into their graph vault you've written about that leading to a loss of joining your note making system but then how are you ensuring that the notes in your system hook up with text that you've clipped where a lot of connected keywords might be found [Music] hmm i don't have the best answer off the top of my head because i think we'd have to really dive into that i'm trying to break break that apart a little bit joel you've written about but then you then how are you ensuring that the notes in your system hook up with the text that you've clicked um okay i think the simple answer right now i mean this is a very nuanced one the simple answer is as i read new information that i'll create a note not based on the article but based on the idea from the article and then i can in that idea in this new note that is my idea you know evergreen note title i link to the web article so in that way i'm not clipping the article into my library itself instead i created something and then i just linked to it outside um that's the bad answer uh i see paul says not a great idea long term to have your pcam in a proprietary cloud system like in rome well yeah i actually i mean those are kind of the points that i'm really fearful of i mean you someone else has your information how do you feel about that you might be okay with it but i have a lot of private thoughts private information i don't want other people to see it even if rome is safe is it safe from you know like somebody wanting to target it and hack it i don't know i don't feel comfortable with that that's why i marked down that's why private files that you can store locally that's another huge benefit so thanks for bringing that one up paul why do you put metadata at the bottom joel asks keep them coming joel oh eric i see you have one here forever oh sorry let me change this one second um okay the reason i put metadata at the bottom of a couple reasons so if it is a note and it's not a map i like to put the um the content uh the back matter at the bottom and the reason is just because at the no singular note level the most important content is the title and what's being mentioned here less important is what it links to and what it tags to in my opinion hey if you feel differently then just switch the order uh no harm no foul once we get to um oh i don't include this one that's it's a little bit too much for the light kit but once we get to a map then i like to put you know this backlink higher level map above it um these are these are personal preferences but now you know why i do it eric asks will i have access to the six week course forever eric yes you will not only that but the six-week course will change in the future and you will have access to that not only that but you won't just have access to it you'll be able to participate with with the new cohorts so this fall cohort is cohort two the first one was the summer cohort which was the private version so in this uh fall cohort you'll have access to that and then to all future iterations and improvement plus the community so anything that you have access to now you'll have access to in the future which i think is pretty awesome not only is it valuable as a knowledge base not only is it valuable well i should say it's valuable as a knowledge base but it's also super valuable as um being a part of a community and you know i find that the community out here it's so inspiring and there are days where i'm not feeling as productive but the community helps me sometimes get to that level where hey i got that energy back all right and so i think in the same manner that having the lifetime access is pretty powerful gustav gustav you ask a great question i'm happy to answer if you realize an moc is built on wrong assumptions how do you go about dealing with that hey delete the mlc the notes don't go anywhere i mean hey if you're still looking at this screen the notes will still exist in this main area right it's just the moc that's gone and then you can start over or you can do whatever you want with the mlc call it something else that is true fluidity in in this structure that's a fluid framework for you carl palmer oh m m i'm sorry mms a bit of a personal question what do you actually do with your notes how are they useful for you in the professional personal life um okay on the personal side well i'll start professional side so professionally currently i'm doing two things i um i'm the co-owner of a business that started wow 11 years ago and still running called pink gloves boxing it is a fitness boxing program that's done in person and i use the personal knowledge management methods i'm talking about with maps and whatnot clunky version in evernote that has then been evolved so i used um the linking you're thinking proto system for this pink clothes boxing program i also used it to help produce a couple independent feature films and i'm trying to think of some of the other uses oh and the most recently i used it as i jumped into a new career in los angeles um as a tv editor and assistant editor so those are the professional uses and personally i i mean i just get so much joy of hopping into my library and i do find that as i work on notes as i mentioned earlier it informs every conversation i then enter so i mean that's a lot of the value i'm getting um okay next up carl i didn't get to your question i see the workshop has six live team this okay yeah i see the workshop has six live team sessions 90 minutes each i live in the southern hemisphere are you able to say what time those live zooms classes will be we are going to solidify that time my best guess right now is that it's going to be um eight or no excuse me 9 a.m pacific time so that's the time right when we started this zoom session except two hours earlier that's the most likely zoom time there is a possibility we split up into two sessions depending on location we did this in the private cohort one so if there is really this big split in the hemispheres and we need to we can approach that so i'm very very open to do that and we've done it previously i think it's best if the group can be together but let's see what happens oyster sauce do you recommend writing x number of notes every day no i think you should write them as the opportunity comes up now if you are a serious professional knowledge worker well then yeah then you you have to put in the work it just depends like what you're doing in life um a good metric to consider um is this how many evergreen notes did i write today and maybe you just you want you want to get above three it doesn't seem like a lot but three times 365 you're doing a lot of work so that's something to consider this is from mike braddock thank you mike um can you talk about the conventions you use and follow and how you developed them that is a little uh vague but i'll i'll try to think about it from that zettlecostin um background the conventions i use uh i would say is this the conventions i use are based on zettlecostin ideas methodology so like atomic notes written in your own words and linked to other notes uh the problem i was having is that i really wanted that higher level view so that's what you know you would be familiar with as a structure note when what i realized though is that i wasn't just indexing information into a structure note i was actually using the structure note as the the the main note where i spent my time and this is why i called a map of content because the map of content sir mlc serves three different purposes assembly uh collision development and uh unification where you unify it with the rest of your knowledge so in that way i was finding that the my work was done mostly in the map of content i was going there to sharpen ideas against each other to ground them together and then i was getting all these diamonds um and i thought it was a little crazy i didn't want to share it with the zelda costume forum because i didn't think that would fly too well and it seemed like what am i trying to do like add all this structure back in but i think for me the big realization was it's not just structure for one it's fluid structure it doesn't get in the way it's not rigid but two it's a way to take my thinking to another level because of how i'm arranging these notes how i'm working ideas fleshing them out creating ideas i've seen where the gaps are in arguments and then creating ideas from there so um hopefully that answers your question a little bit [Music] [Music] you
