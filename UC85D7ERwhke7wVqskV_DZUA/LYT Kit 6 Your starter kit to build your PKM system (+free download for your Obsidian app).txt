[Music] it is happening physically in our own brains which kind of blows my mind so this is my home note and this is my launch pad it's my home base your digital library should number one be a joy to use [Music] welcome to light kit 6 your sandbox for linked notes i'm so excited to share this iteration of the light kit with you and if you're new here the light kit is the number one starter kit in the world for helping people get a grasp of what's possible with linked notes it has been downloaded over 30 000 times and that means that the audience has shifted a little bit to a broader spectrum of people and with that in mind i want to reintroduce it to that world to give you an easier on-ramp into the various uses and ways that you can apply the light kit so let's hop in if you're looking at the screen now you should see the sections are on the left we have the folders on the right we have tags and those are two of four major relationship builders that we have at our fingertips when we work with linked knowledge folders tags well guess what number three is it's the reason that this video is being recorded links see this right here this is a link so i'm on a note right now and when i click this it opens up a link it opens up that note now i can go hit a back button so let me go forward again if you're using the application that you see on screen right now it's called obsidian i can go up here and hit the back button and that will take me back to where i just was now let me go back into the forest entrance so what we see here is some words that i've written in a note but what's different now is i can link this note into related other notes not only that but those other notes that exist out there can link back towards this note and that is a really powerful way of thinking and it mirrors the way our own brains work and we have not we have not had at our fingertips the ability to do this digitally at almost the speed that we can think but now we can technology has gotten to the point where we can almost work with our thoughts digitally as fast as we can have them and that gets me really really excited i want to show you a couple other things here so we had folders over here we had tags over on the right well now on the bottom right we have a new section called linked mentions you may have also seen them called backlinks and those are those outside notes that are have mentioned this note here and one of them i want to direct your eye towards is guiding values of pkm not only that though but this is a link that goes both ways because i actually point it out right here and that's where we want to go to next so as we jump into the light kit for the first time your sandbox for linked notes this is a playground there are a lot of different use cases here and i want to stress the importance of that this isn't a one-size-fits-all solution but it's a place that you can experiment with different folders different tags different linking systems and see which ones work for you now underpinning all this is a lot of theory around the value of links some things that we call fluid frameworks that allow links to work much more fluidly and robustly than our previous captors of a folder only system we don't abolish the folder but we work with it more broadly folders tags links and a fourth one we'll get to in just a little bit so first let's jump into the guiding values of pkm i want to direct your eye to a few different areas the first one though is we're going to cover be a joy to use so when you think about guiding values of pkm your digital library should number one be a joy to use and that serves two purposes one knowledge should be able to exist on its own not as a means to an end to accomplish a project or a task or something else that by itself is soulless it's a soulless form of efficiency and that is fine we all have to make a living but that being said they should be joyful and if they are joyful then all of a sudden that efficiency that productivity that we all crave also becomes joyful because we return back to the systems that manage all of those processes and when we do that we're able to use joy as a tool to return and to actually accomplish those things where that we're trying to accomplish pretty cool i think i'll let you read through the rest on your own time the next thing i want to point you to is something that's happening at the top and so this is sort of the top link you could call it an uplink you could call it the light link linking your thinking as a best practice what you'll see in the majority of the notes is some version of at least one uplink because when you make a note a best practice is to link it to another note when you make that connection it means that you have a higher likelihood of recalling that information that's contextually important when you need to find it that's kind of a valuable thing so for now i'm going to scroll to the bottom and i'll scroll to the top and i'm like let me go back let me go up and that takes me back to the forest entrance okay now we have a choice and i'm not sure which one i'm going to choose we can actually go deeper into the light kit which is where all the walkthroughs and the terms are all spelled out for you or we can go to the home note and i'm actually kind of feeling the home note so we're going to go home first and then to the like kit so let me jump into home and i think this is pretty cool so this is my home note and this is my launch pad it's my home base that's here that's home there are four different areas that we can think about when we approach knowledge management and this will be different for everybody but the first one is a walkthrough of ideas a lot of content creators out there today people who want to encounter new ideas and see how they can express those ideas in their own way in their own from their own unique perspective so how does that process look well you need to encounter some new things you go online to the arena where ideas are done and then you make sure that you have them somewhere so you can process that interesting stuff you can develop those notes develop those ideas of all those ideas and share those ideas so each of these is part of that process we don't have time now but in the supplemental videos because this is just the introduction but i'm going to be digging in deeper into a lot of these concepts assuming that you've downloaded this kit then you'll have access to a series of instructional videos that dive a little bit deeper into the folder structure over here and a lot of the other interesting and powerful aspects of the light kit for now broad overview another aspect is when it's not just about ideas but a lot of people also want to manage their efforts their productivity well what does that look like so here is a way that you can manage your projects and other aspects of your work and life spaces next on the docket if we go a little bit further down we have ways to manage our knowledge there's a lot here i'll cover that in a different video and last so important to include this the fourth area to always focus on is the uniquely human wondrous joy of thinking itself so let me just jump into this thinking note and the reason i want to show you this particular note is because you'll notice a lot of links that are not included a lot of notes that are not included and that's because of something else that's pretty cool with linked knowledge this whole light kit 300 notes it's just a tiny folder in which it it lives within my bigger collection of my personal knowledge so i'm just sharing this folder with you and in my bigger folder it has links to all these other notes that are grayed out and so at the top there's this little thing called the call out if you click on that it'll explain what you can expect in that particular note so this is a sanitized version of my actual note where content and links have been removed so that is just something to take note of now if i want to go back home how can i accomplish that one of two ways right now if you notice there's actually home right here or i can go ahead and click that up link at the top that takes me home okay now we've covered folders basically in a broad broadest sense we've covered where tags exist on the page and we've started to get our hands a little dirty playing with links now what about that fourth relationship builder that i've been hinting at and that is a query and you can think of a query as a saved search let's look at one together so in the area of playing with ideas if i've captured if i've collected if i've made note of things that i found online that i think are interesting i can jump into this thing called the cooling pad and this is where i can see some of those new things right now see this little table this is a table that is looking searching into this folder called encounters and pulling out certain notes from these interior folders and it's displaying those results auto updating live for me right here so this is a query it's a saved search sometimes i like to refer to that as a data scope because it's a scope a lens that you can put on all of your notes to surface the ones that are important to you in this context what's the context here this is a cooling pad so i might come across something interesting online and i want to make note of it but then what do i do how do i end up connecting that to other knowledge well that's the next step so what i would do is i'd jump into one of these notes and i would connect it to another aspect of my knowledge management system something else that's kind of interesting is you can or sort this by days alive if you wanted to and see that this one was just saved two days ago well this one has been saved a week ago kind of cool well let's go up hit this home note and now we can jump into the final aspect to get you running and that is the light kit note so this is going to provide an overview of the light kit now this is about 300 notes so as we jump into the light kit i want to just walk through this moc for you and moc is actually something that is explained in the light kit mlc but in general it is a map of content and there's a lot of confusion around what a map of content is i'll have to work hard in other videos to explain this but in general it is a note that has links to other notes and the map of content serves three purposes for you it helps you gather ideas it helps you develop those ideas and then it helps you navigate those ideas so when most people think of an index note what is an index note doing it's helping you navigate notes but an index note does not help gather and develop those notes develop is the strongest most next level form of thinking that linked notes can provide you and so that needs to be emphasized at every single turn whoa i can actually develop notes when i stick them close to each other and start having them kind of talk and interact with each other that's outside the scope of this video but that is the power of the map of content so it's easy to think of higher order notes as passive static index notes they can be that but they can be so much more and that's what a map of content is all about it is a mapping note notice it's a verb it helps you map the content of your existing notes and in that mapping process actually generating new notes new insights new connections very powerful okay moving forward that's for another time you can kind of work your way through and see the overview of the light framework understand a little bit more of the terminology what are higher order notes is the linking your thinking framework for you what are maps of content i was covering that a little bit but there are great details here to help the light bulb really click because it takes a little bit to understand why is this so important but once you do it's very very very exciting fluid frameworks white categories for your notes are actually a good idea and then another part of the light kit are the actual walkthroughs so you have three major walkthroughs the first one is the process of note making so note making is greatly distinct from note taking in case i forget exactly what the definition is i could actually look it up on the fly for us right now so if i look up note makers this is a search i'm going to open this in a new tab and note makers are people who spend their thinking time in an active engaged way making sense of the stuff they encounter contrast this ideal with the pandemic of note takers we can look into note takers and we can see that these are people who spend too much of their time consuming information passively and you can notice here that x is an intersection it marks the spot it's not always an uplink but we always want to have a note linked to another note so in this case note takers naturally is linking to note makers and that is going to lead us to if we now we go up to on the process of note making if we go up one more time takes us back to the light kit so i'll go ahead and close this note because we're back in the light kit and what else do we have in front of us we also have a walkthrough on maps of content how can we use maps of content for massive ideation this shows you those three phases there's a gathering phase there's a colliding phase also a developing phase and a navigating phase very very exciting all aspects these are the three phases and we'll talk about them in depth then there's another briefer walkthrough which is about developing your own home note now all of this stuff we cover in depth intensely in the linking your thinking workshop but i'm trying to provide the free resource for the diy crowd the people that want to do it themselves where they can go in and understand a little bit about the mechanisms behind linked knowledge there's an exploratory on whatever green notes are i like to think that they're living notes and this is one of those paradigms that we really have to reinforce again and again so a lot of us grew up with the idea that notes are created we churn with them and then they kind of burn out turn and burn they're used for that test and then they lose their meaning their relevance their significance in the age of the linked note we have the opportunity to make notes that are more evergreen that continue to live that continue to be linked to notes that can change this is a really powerful paradigm shift and once we work with this the the benefits become self-apparent but i try to spell this out a little bit in this evergreen notes exploratory and if you keep working your way down you can see even more notes to kind of guide you through this process of understanding linked notes now as you jump into working with linked notes there are a lot of paradigm shifts there are a lot of new understandings that you're going to have to become comfortable with and my hope my goal is that the light kit can help you become comfortable with this paradigm shift now we can hold on to that of which we're familiar folders we don't have to throw those away many of us are probably familiar with tags as well although we're probably using them in a way that wasn't very good there are ways to actually make tags come alive and tags are weak but in their weakness is a strength far greater than we can possibly imagine but the true star of linked knowledge are the links themselves and if you focus on the links if from time to time you decide to close the folder sidebar and you decide to close the tags sidebar then you can allow yourself to rely on links what do you think happens up here when we remember something we connected a thought that we just had with another thought and that strengthens that connection those neurons those dendrites are growing and re-strengthening in signal the same thing happens when we link two notes together and when it happens digitally and we put in the effort it is happening physically in our own brains which kind of blows my mind pun intended with that in mind let's go back to the home note and you'll have so much to play with here so many ideas that will come to you make this system your own that might be a little daunting that's why if you downloaded this there's a series that will come with it where we will explore in depth the access folder structure which is the perfect marriage between knowledge and projects it's also the perfect marriage between folders and links the access folder structure is something i'm very excited about because it gives us a familiar comforting warmth that folders can provide but it still gives us the flexibility that links have to offer us and with that in mind i'm going to wrap this one up be on the lookout for the supplemental videos where i introduce a few of these concepts in more detail this is the broad overview it's meant to have some handholding and to give you a sense of what you can do with linked notes learn by doing experiment play around in the sandbox and see what you can come up with i wish you the best and until next time stay connected hey after you get some repetitions with the light kit you have a few other things that you can do you can check out the obsidian flight school program where you can learn the tool a little bit that's perfect for people who are getting stuck with the technology but they still want to take advantage of linked notes sometimes it's just about getting better technically and then everything starts to unlock and for those who really want to take their knowledge to the next level and learn in a social environment that is really really quite spectacular i encourage you to learn more about the light workshop the linking your thinking workshop which is a six week live instructional hands-on brains on workshop where you get repetition setting up your custom future proof personal knowledge management system with me and hundreds of others at the same time it is exciting and we're about to go into our next one you can see the links below if you're interested sign up there and if not i'll see you in the next video here [Music] you
