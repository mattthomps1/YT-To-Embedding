[Music] triangulation is using two known points to find a third point now this is actually something that we do all of the time every version of sense making that we can possibly do every moment of every day involves us triangulating information triangulation if we could personify it it would say i'm the ultimate sense-making mechanism to both the known and the unknown let's break that apart there are three powers to this thing that we do every moment of every day and that is we use what we know to make sense of stuff number two we use what we know to remember old stuff and last we use what we know to actually create new stuff that kind of sounds almost self-explanatory but it's pretty profound once we break it down just a little bit more so if we were going to rephrase this it would be we use two points to understand a third point we can use two points to remember a third point and we can use two points that we do know to imagine a third point so now let's go into examples visually to see what this might look like the first power of triangulation is that we can use two points to understand a third point so what does that look like exactly let's see this is you you've met me i'm nick over here and i'm this circle and i'm saying things about paste layers but if both of those things me and the term paste layers are new to you then from your perspective there's not much of a triangle and so you can't really get a sense of depth or any real perspective on these two things me and pace layers however as you become more comfortable with me i become more clear to you and closer to your level of understanding of what i'm all about and you also start to understand paste layers a little bit so now what are we getting we're getting some sort of triangle forming where we can use what we know about nick to inform what we know about paste layers over more time over more time with myself and with this concept we have a greater understanding a clarity of both of me nick and of this concept called paste layers and that is the triangle that we're going for in in this metaphor is that we want to have a great understanding of both pace layers and of me and why is that so important because now when there's a new concept out there new concept x and perhaps you hear me talking about it then you already know what i'm about these days and you know what i think about pace layers so that gives you a good sense already of how you're going to approach concept x because if you didn't have these two dots to triangulate around then you wouldn't be able to make sense of it so very quickly with concept x you can pull it into a greater a more balanced triangle using me as the pivot point along with yourself the two known points to extrapolate and understand a third point and that's the first power of triangulation using two known points to understand a third point let's go into the second power the second power of triangulation is to use two points to remember a third point before i show you what that looks like on the next graphic this graphic isn't from me this is actually from a little-known lecture by someone called richard feynman and he is using this graphic to show that we can use two points to remember a third point we knew these two points these two points and these two points and from them we can triangulate back into our past memories to recover lost knowledge i'm not sure if you've ever had a good friend or maybe it's your significant other and between the two of you you can recall that thing but if you were just by yourself you wouldn't have been able to that's an example of using two points to triangulate back into the past to remember a third point okay and the third power of triangulation is perhaps i don't know the most exciting when you really think about what it's doing for us in this world of linking our thinking is we can take our existing body of growing thoughts especially if we've externalized it into this note making space and we can use it to actually imagine a third point almost an intersection between the two and at these intersections at these crossroads between different ideas understandings that's where we're creating new insights and from new insights creating new value and that is how you can use two points to imagine a third point that means the better that you can triangulate the faster that you can move in the world of ideas if if you don't over collect and drown your system and noise if you don't over structure and suffocate your system in rigidity and if you don't over highlight and just leave no time for actually actively thinking then then you will have idea emergence you'll have an emergent system that encourages your ability to triangulate knowledge you will leverage these always present powers of triangulation to understand to remember and to imagine better than ever before [Music] [Music] you
