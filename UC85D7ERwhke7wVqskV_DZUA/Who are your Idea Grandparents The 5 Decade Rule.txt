and let's try this again we good all right find your favorite thinkers and doers born five decades before you they're your grandparents not of blood but of ideas and they can help you more than others in the following i'll share how i discovered this why it works and how you can use it plus a surprising takeaway at the end so let's roll doing the introduction for dr sagan will join his speech now consider again that dot that's here that's home that's us if we're looking at the skills with which a person leaves school then skill of thinking is probably more important than any other flow is a state of mind or an experience a state of experience that we feel when we are totally involved in what we're doing [Music] it's crazy to think that over 77 percent of you are not subscribed that's what i get for not asking all the time but if you've been watching and i know you have because it says right here and you've been enjoying then please subscribe it'll help me help you by making sure i can make more of these videos cool all right let's go if you only organize alphabetically you are missing out to really understand something every piece of context can really help we already do this with our notes when we organize by things like date created but what about with people wouldn't it be kind of cool to organize by date born actually it kind of is it tells you so much more it's ridiculous we don't do it more often so let's do some people mapping right now and see how it led to the five decade rule so i want to share with you how i discovered the five decade rule through a process called people mapping you can do this process too here's how it looks one day you can be note making notes on people that are of interest to you for whatever reason it is one day i was doing that for carl sagan and i decided let's try to put people together make them this tag people and then the p here stands for prominent so this is essentially prominent people in science so i decided to do that just a simple tag there and then organize by birth date i thought this might be cool because at this point i had a lot of dots in my map a lot of different people a lot of different dates and i finally wanted to understand a little bit more about when they were born and what that meant so what i did was i created a new note called prominent people we're going to open prominent people up now here we are prominent people so what i did here is i wanted to see these people in various ways to pull out some insights so you're going to see 87 people apparently that i've given a tag prominent people sorted by the date they were born roughly right we don't know everything for sure and let's check out where carl sagan is i'm really curious here one of my favorite thinkers on my mount rushmore of favorite thinkers 1934. so as i looked at this i was like oh well who else is on 1930. no way mihai and that is when the epiphany struck me there's something special here there's something special about 1934. what is that well it's roughly five decades a little bit more than that before i was born therefore there's something interesting here just out of curiosity who else is born around this window of time so i looked in both directions and you had edward de bono who had the six thinking hats so another prominent thinker and in this direction you had richard sal werman who created ted the ted talks so one year in either direction and there were other people who were prominent in the thinking space that i've made a special note on now that might just be some sort of cognitive bias in my own world of ideas but there's something unique here and before the end of this video i hope you can find some unique connections yourself let's chart this out what does this look like they were born around five decades before me so i decided and if you come over here to this drawing diagram we have the 1930s here 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s so i was born in the 80s 90s 2000s 2010s and 2020s they were born in the 30s so we can put a little star there and in the 80s a little star here now what that means is that these are our grandparents of ideas so we want to kind of think about when are they going to come out with their best works their best works are going to come out roughly during the time that we were born our idea grandparents birth the ideas around the same time that we are born i think this is really profound it's really profound to consider this and why that's so nice is because then when we come of age and we get to the point where we're interested in the pursuit of ideas and making sense of the world around us so that's going to be a few decades down the road and hopefully continue from that point onward that gives us a period of time where these ideas can be vetted so we're just going to create our little idea globe here so the ideas that were born when we were are vetted that means that they've been tested and time is the ultimate test so if those ideas are still around once we start to discover the world around us and want to learn about it that's a pretty wild thing but these ideas if you look back aren't too old and their life the life that informed the ideas is within the context that's relevant to us so this context now if we go back further and you get into the ancient times way back when that's going to not have as much context now humanity is humanity so there's always context but it's not quite the same they weren't dealing with the effects of the industrial revolution of war of airplanes you know things like that technology so this context from our idea grandparents informs their ideas and their ideas if they're around when we become interested in ideas if they're still around that means that they have value most likely and that is why we need to identify our idea grandparents so this is what birthed the five decade rule all from a process if you come back to my screen here of people mapping and it is a way to make rapid sense of something not only that but to make insights that you would have never even realized otherwise and this carl sagan and mihai chick sent me being born in the same year and all this thought around it to create the five decade rule is the perfect example of sense making through a process called people mapping and it led to this cool concept handle called the five decade rule so why does the five decade rule work because people born five decades before you they're old enough to have already made their greatest contributions most likely and those contributions have been vetted as long as you've been alive on the other side they are young enough to come from the same cultural understanding meaning you are able to see how they lived their life in a cultural context at least somewhat similar to your own so we're not going all the way back into the ancient times we're just going back five decades okay let's talk about how to use the five decade rule take a moment right now and think about the big idea influencers in your life make a quick list five people maybe more but at least five now go online and find out what year they were born now let me say this clearly it is a big big problem if everyone you learn from is in their 20s the best and most enriching way to learn is to learn from people of all ages from every decade and the majority of those people you learn from should already be dead i know that might sound a little morose but that's the way it has to be if you want to have a full mouth feel of experience of flavors of umami when it comes to how you are learning because if you're only learning from people stuck in one decade you're cutting yourself off to so much more okay rant over let's go back to the exercise let's imagine by now you've identified your idea grandparents and you've grabbed their birth year my next question to you is do you notice any patterns emerging what do you notice let's keep going after this exercise take a moment and recognize the extra questions you started asking yourself this is where the magic happens so it's it's really hard to pin this down but we're going to do it let's put a spotlight on it for example carl sagan and mihai i want to know where they were during world war ii they were both kids then how did that impact their psyche were they in actual harm's way and then i also want to ask who else was born around that same time period that i seem to resonate with or really appreciate that's going to give me additional context what was going on there what type of thinkers and art was created from people born in this tiny window of time this is what you get when you give yourself the gift of a well-linked thinking environment so let's reflect on this process and i hope you realize something maybe we've been missing out on how to organize books movies and even people by birth date or published date there's so much context there let's take advantage of that and we can do that in our linking systems [Music] now all this looking back five decades made me think of a really peculiar goal to be what they are to me i want to be what carl sagan and mihai chikset mihai are to me and that is to have someone not in my family five decades younger than me deeply express how my thoughts changed their life to be what they are to me that's a peculiar goal but i really like it and maybe you will too so i guess what that means is i'll just have to be on the lookout in the late 2060s hey i hope you enjoyed the five decade rule it's a nice concept handle please please share your idea grandparents in the comments below because that way we can become inspired by each other and until next time my friends stay connected [Music] [Music] you
