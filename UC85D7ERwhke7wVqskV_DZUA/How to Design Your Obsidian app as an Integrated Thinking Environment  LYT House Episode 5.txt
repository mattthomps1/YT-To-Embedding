[Music] hello welcome everyone welcome to the lighthouse i am super excited to be here with ryan j.a murphy he's climbed the lighthouse and we're going to have a discussion on what obsidian really is data design knowledge innovation maybe some screen shares with ryan's pretty wild home screen maybe we look at project management we look really at what an ite is all about integrated thinking environments and then at the end we'll turn it over to an ama for ryan where you can ask him anything and we already have the q a open so go ahead and as as the need arises put your questions in there and you can up vote as well so with that in mind what's up ryan how you doing hey doing good i'm getting nervous as that number of participants climbs but you know i think that's natural i didn't realize that you were using this this lighthouse metaphor i might have planned uh some kind of either way of mocking you or uh you know some way of playing with that a bit more but i like it i like it well i'm really happy you're here and yeah i know you have a lot to show us so i don't want to to deprive everyone who's joined but yeah where should we start with mockery i think it would be a fun and sort of tasty thing for people to dive right into the home screen that i joked about because it is kind of goofy it took a lot of work to set up it was one of those projects you know that just like you know i was procrastinating something more important so i was playing with what icons i can draw and put on my home screen and how they can work but i think people will like it and i think everybody can kind of learn from it so am i am i screen sharing from my ipad yet i don't think i am nope from your ipad no just yet i'm trying to somebody somebody flip switch give me access this is the home screen that i was talking about and if you can't read it i'll just read up the little the little icons there's like a drawing of you know the obsidian graph and this is all based on obsidian i know that the wait is it again are we saying lyt are we saying lit we're saying light or lyt okay so the light community i know that you are using a variety of apps but many of you are on obsidian i think you can adapt a lot of these ideas to any other kind of integrated thinking environment as we'll get into it but the idea here is that if you're on ios this is using shortcuts and mostly just like bookmarks on the home screen but if you're using android there should be other ways i don't know the apps that you can use to generate icons and put them on your home screen but you can do the same thing and just launch url schemes from those buttons but just to read them from the top in case you can't see that text it's daily notes wayfinder books current book draft journal projects and current project then on the left over here there's a widget it's the graph of obsidian and you see that opened right up into obsidian in the bottom left it's today's agenda in a widget and that uses this um fancy app called widget pack where you basically draw text down from some text files and then present it on the ipad home screen or the ios home screen as a list of to do so the to-do's are chat with nick and that was our pre-chat at 9 30 and then chat with nick and other people that's you guys a 10. and then a 1010 obsidian home screen demo goes perfectly so i'm i'm excited to take that off later and then 11 relax you know after all this is over and you finished making fun of me and then if i tap that it'll jump right into the daily notes button which is the same thing as i've got up here in the daily notes shortcut so all those are kind of kind of fun but not that complicated i'll provide a link perhaps in the chat to the way to do the widget pack widget but i think all of that is just kind of for show the other ones are actually more functional so the other buttons i've added here are actually i happened upon this sort of accidentally and i think it really works oh sorry patrick you're saying oh no patrick that's right so you're seeing my my home screen on my ipad and that is a set of buttons that are all actually obsidian buttons there they're buttons for different functions in obsidian does that make sense cool and they're beautiful so by the way like i know you have a graphic design background i'm just everything we're looking at is just gorgeous you always have such attention to detail but you know and i appreciate that but you know what that really represents is that i wasted a whole bunch of time trying to figure out the exact right purple gradient for this backdrop uh that i'm using here but i appreciate that you know that attention to detail has and wasted time has has not gone unappreciated so so the rest of these all take uh advantage of obsidian's like native text and they all tap into text files that i can get access to and then they use the information that you can see in those text files in order to do some dynamic things which is really cool so if i tap the current book button and brie is going to get a shout out here i see bree in the chat if i tap current book it jumps right into like the current file i've got on the book that i'm reading and that's no big deal right that's not very complicated everybody knows or or it is pretty easy and we can talk about exactly how to do it if you want an ama to create a link to a specific file an obsidian but that's not actually what i'm doing if i tap the books and i tap book lists it actually draws from a specific text file from a list of books and then it gives me this dynamic list and you see at the top there is that first book that i had opened around a reading group that's the book representing free and uh the knowledge architectures book club that brie and i are running and then the rest of the list is a bunch of books that i've downloaded and got set up in devon think and if i tap any of those buttons i'm not going to do it right now but if i tap them it'll open that book right up in devon think and i can start reading right away and that dynamic list is actually generated straight from a text file from a file from a note i keep an obsidian it's the same thing is true for my projects list if i and i didn't do anything so this is where the demo might not go so perfectly go away okay okay so if i tap the projects list this is like this is i knew this would happen shortcuts has this weird glitch where if sometimes if you don't act on an action from the um home screen it sort of gives up and then you need to reboot the device so i'm not going to do that i'm just going to go in here and tap the projects list so this is going to do something similar it grabs a list of projects that i've got in obsidian i can show you what that looks like and then from there yeah seeing shortcuts has given me trouble from there try it again obsidian click the projects button it gives a dynamic list of projects that i keep okay so it's a kanban this is the file that that shortcut actually draws from and what i did was i said split up this file and give me a list of all of my projects and the cool thing is that if i move these objects around the kanban then the shortcut that i just tapped will actually dynamically change so i manage all of my projects i actually give or i manage my projects and my i use obsidian mostly as a project management tool less as a knowledge management tool which might uh be something we can talk about later but if i manage my projects from here it actually will dynamically change how that shortcut that i just launched shows the list of projects that it'll show it and the topmost one is the one that corresponds with the current project button over here so it's a similar idea for the books if i change the order of books in obsidian and i tap the current book then i will jump right into that first book on the list what you're showing you have uh the advanced workflows that you've set up that lead you you're creating an environment and this is kind of a nice jumping off board because if we look at your your ipad screen you have eight different places that immediately take you to different ways of of thinking and that's part of your in information system right you got it that's quite a that's a segue so what i'm trying to show is that there is this home screen acts as a jumping off point but there's one source of truth right obsidian and everything i keep an obsidian is a representation of my world it's a representation and it's the same thing for all of you and anybody who's managing knowledge in these these apps it is a dynamic representation that helps you think about your world organize it and then use that to change the world around you and so what i'm trying to do is use what i've gotten obsidian as a current source of truth i don't have a physical bookshelf because all of my books are digital so instead i keep this digital bookshelf and that one source that one list of books that i'm currently reading is something that i don't have to worry about replicating other apps i don't have to open up a variety of apps to figure out you know where the book is i'm currently reading i actually just keep that managed in obsidian and when i tap that current book button button it opens up the current book that i'm reading and i can jump right in and so one of the key concepts that i'm trying to play with here is yes this what nick just mentioned this idea that you're actually representing thinking in these systems and by managing one source of truth by managing one set of information and dynamically drawing from that to do all kinds of different things you're reducing what is called cognitive capacity or you're reducing the the need for you to have cognitive capacity there's no thinking about what the next book is it's just tap the chromebook button and jump right in so the idea is to try to draw down the amount of effort it takes to get started and to get working on some of these things i will say this just to put a little bit more spotlight on why this is so wild and i think it ties into your integrated thinking sys environments is because something like obsidian in these environments you're creating all these like these are dashboards and i think guthrie said in the chat sir it's a surrogate dashboard for obsidian and it's all this stuff is going to your single source of truth and i i it's kind of hard to encapsulate the um exciting brilliance that that this time has brought upon us where we can easily have a single source of truth after you know years of being in the darkness with digital information and trying to make sense of scattered pieces absolutely everywhere so i don't know i just this is so cool yeah and i think the neat thing about all these tools is that they're for the first time in a long time putting things in the same place bringing costs bringing us as individuals to us as thinkers closer to our thoughts which sounds kind of hokey but if we get really good at it and i think we are just through using these tools and through developers building plugins that make it easier to do specific things getting closer to thoughts is actually starting to matter and i i know that probably makes no sense but hopefully through the rest of the conversation we can sort of break that down a little bit more getting closer to thoughts let's put a pin in that because i like i want to hear more about this getting closer to our representation of thoughts uh and actually maybe that maybe i can share one one more thing before i shut off and we can change gears a little bit but the neat thing about about this idea of integrative thinking environments is that so we're thinking we have all these uh ideas and arguments and a project that we're trying to manage and so on mostly in our heads and mostly spread sometimes over all kinds of post-it notes or note files or whatever and these new apps apps like obsidian and rom have made it a little easier to realize that when you have a thought and then you represent it you're actually creating sort of two different thoughts you've got the thing that's in your head and you've got the thing that you've put down on paper and the closer you can make those two things to be the same uh the lower the cognitive load it'll cost thank you chat for for getting that so that the lower cognitive load you'll have and trying to keep two different representations of of the world in place and by recognizing that what you're doing when you're writing all these notes is actually creating what nick has called what nick is referenced as an information system so you're representing your thoughts in a different place you're letting that thing inform your thinking again and you're letting it interact so you're creating this idea of of a second brain i i don't like because i don't think we need two brains um brains are quite complicated uh and i have a lot of thoughts about that sort of metaphor but you're certainly augmenting your cognition you're certainly augmenting your ability to think through complex topics by spreading out your cognitive load and by increasing your cognitive capacity to have bigger thoughts this is foundational this is foundational like thoughts and yeah i mean that's that's why you're on here is to share your wisdom with us from this rigorous perspective this academic perspective that's also based in practicality with pkm it's like this perfect mixture of the two because what you're doing is in your studies is a lot of information systems if i'm accurate okay and then combining that with this world that we're all here for you know these ites to use your term uh like obsidian in rome and that can augment this world and that we can learn the lessons that you see every day through information systems and how we can apply that with pkm i just i yeah it's great there's something there yeah if i was going to talk a lot i was going to switch over to a little drawing app and sketch out some ideas maybe very briefly to sort of explain some of the things that i just talked about information systems represent the world they help inform a user about what the world contains and they help you act on the world and so that's what that's what nick and i are talking about when we say information systems information systems is actually a whole branch of management management scholarship and practice it's really old and so i found it really funny when pkm started to get popular sort of again really when became started to get popular about a few years ago it wasn't being informed by information systems and yet there's a whole bunch of study out there on exactly how we represent worlds in computers in information systems and that's kind of why what i'm drawing on those those areas of scholarship and and practice and this might seem silly but again i'm just going to reiterate that when you have a thought when you have a thought in your head and i realize my writing is not great so hopefully this sort of takes you back to like a college math professor and you're trying to scrutinize the board to figure out what exactly that x really represents but when you have a thought in your brain it's a little sketch of a brain and then you actually put it down on paper or on digital paper and in an ite in what we're calling an integrated thinking environment integrated thinking environment well you're no longer actually talking about that thought it's a representation of that thought and that representation interacts with the thought that you you had yourself and so you never have the same thought twice you never represent the same thought twice because the thought's no longer the same and neither are you right and i think a lot of what nick has been practicing and linking your thinking and with maps of content and so on is actually kind of about this it's about representing and breaking down the thinking that you're doing and then letting that thinking provide you a map right and that's the inform angle over here and then as you interact with that map and you manipulate it and you move it around you're actually acting on it and you're changing what that thought is and advancing you're thinking about a given topic area or a given issue or whatever that's just really wild because i can only tell you from my experiences my my entry point into pkm has all just been kind of what i've needed to do without any structure or basically i think like most people where you're just trying to get along in the world and solve your problems and you're not really thinking about what you're doing and why and so to hear you come and say well i mean we we know that a lot of us have heard the phrase what the map is not the territory yeah yeah and it's it's a representation which you're just getting at and it's that same thing but if we don't think about it we think it's the same thing we think it is reality we think that you know the the word rock is that is rock and it's exactly what it is it's it's rock but it's only a word that we're using to describe this object out there in the real world and that that rock and that rock aren't exactly the same so their representations and what i like is how you're you're you're bringing that sort of mindset to what we're doing which i'm sure is informed by information systems and then and then it's looking at that makes me think like to your point that you've said in some other things what can that then inform us about how we design our own pkm systems and the thoughts around that that i'm kind of interested about yeah yeah it's funny these ideas this idea of an ite is not not a new one i think that doug albart was one of the famous computer scientists from a long time ago i think he was originally one of the progenitors of these these concepts but i think what people ran with as they started so there were examples of ites i think through the aegis through the last few decades but i think what they always did was they tried to overstructure i think they tried to you know give people this really complicated sort of interface where you had menus and lists and all sorts of different pieces and they failed to recognize that people have been creating ites since you know we started carving straight and stone we've been ex representing our thinking somewhere externally using that to inform and then using that to act and to shape the world around us so a very simple example might be like the uh i forget if it's a tablet or the stone of himmerabi one of the first pieces of policy ever written down right that was some king the king decided that the world should be a certain way the king represented his thinking on that in a given on a piece of stone you put that somewhere for where other people could see it and be informed by that policy and then people had to shape their actions and if you did certain things you got thrown on a river because people thought you're a witch so it wasn't necessarily a great sort of model necessarily for the world but it was an early instance of an information system and of and a thinking environment but it wasn't integrated in fact it might not have even been considered an environment what we're getting now are these note systems we're getting this ability for everybody to sort of scratch their ideas down on stone and then interact with them and the latest raft of apps rome and obsidian and log second athens and advance give people these tools to be able to put things down on paper and then instead of trying to add a lot of complexity you can you can or a complication you can add a lot of complication to it if you want you can add a lot of say metadata fields and other kinds of of ways of adding metadata to it but most people just represent metadata through how they organize their notes the folders and the tags you add to it and then the links the relationships you build between those and those lead to a really kind of rich way of taking what might seem a basic concept a note and then giving it this rich relationship to all these other notes and suddenly you've got that integration and you've if you're given a software like obviously in a rom you can you have an environment to play with it so that's where my head is about all these things yeah and that's i really like that history about you know how integrated thinking environments because it does make me think there was a video i don't know if it was apple or what from 70s 80s where there's uh a business executive man he's like at his desk and he's got a computer in her face that he's interested in yeah yeah yeah i love to find that it's hilarious it is it was it was apple it was apple and the guy's he's a researcher he's a researcher so the guy this is a concept tech piece it was one of the only videos apple's ever made which is one of the reasons why it's a interesting piece of trivia but this researcher sits down and he's like give me the latest reports on the amazon rainforest and then the computer sort of like shows him this list and he like picks from them and he's like oh i need to call tracy on um that when he tells the computer to call tracy but but it does provide this like really the this neat representation of uh exactly how these pieces of information can fit together and how we as the thinker have a have the ability to interact with them and put them together in new things so yeah yeah we'll find that video i i'm curious i have a few questions before we go into two of them this the the one that's a little bit more straightforward but not straightforward at the same time what is a note what is a note because i've been throwing out there just something that came to to my mind is that it's a container of thought and i was kind of curious to get your your perspective on you know what you what you think a note is yeah i think i'm going to fail you on this answer i wrote a treatise sort of that i never published on like how we shouldn't be calling these things notes um because they're like a note and in the real definition of the term is generally this like ephemeral thing that you sort of write on a script of paper and throw away and that's kind of a cruel representation of what these things are to us because they're actually like you know we had a i had a baby recently my recent dad and uh a lot of the thinking around our child was represented in notes right but like that's a that's a really important thing so to call it a note is almost almost sad but yes i i guess if you get away from my dramatics a note is a container of thought it's a way of using writing you know using verbiage to verbiage to capture something you're thinking about and we've been thrown around this term information systems but really every single note is an information system every single note represents something in the world and allows you to be it informs you later when you forget what your plan was it informs you later and then by interacting with that note and using its information to change something about the world it's allowing you to act so that might be another way of putting it it's like a node is an information system and it does it is an information system because of those three functions what do you think about early on in the obsidian beta we were talking a lot about uh maps of content as a term and having a really healthy conversation around if that was a good one or not but i think overall i love having the conversation about representations of different types of notes if we if we go along and say like okay let's let's say their notes just so we can communicate amongst each other i find it so enlightening when someone talks about a different type of note and someone invariably will say well that's just a no they're all notes yes and no because if we think about them differently it's like expanding our vocabulary we're able to approach a problem with this new tool all of a sudden and it's kind of like the opposite of 1984 when you cut down on vocabulary you cut down on the ways that we can think so if we expand on vocabulary it seems like we can expand on the ways that we can think that kind of ties into your workbench plug-in among other things but i'm just kind of curious your thoughts on you know the vocabulary around pkm man manage like the yeah the vernacular around it and if there's any there are any ways that we should consider different types of notes right i mean this might be a segway to talk about another concept from information systems which is the idea of a conceptual model which you might you might just want to use the phrase mental model but one of the reasons i think roman obsidian and so on have taken off ites have taken off lately is because a note can be anything and that's one of the neat things about this like simple text piece of text is like you know you can write down depending on what you write in it it changes what it is and so a conceptual model is a term it's an idea from information systems that defines how you structure reality in an information system which sounds big it's not the idea is simply that you know when you capture the world when you capture something you're thinking about or you're capturing an observation you can only capture what is salient to you about that think about it let's use a metaphor if you take a photo of a tree um and you're using a camera then you're capturing what that tree looks like in the wavelengths of the camera you can only capture that information you and sometimes you'll have exif metadata so you'll be able to capture where the photo was taken you know the kind of camera it was and so on but there's still a whole world that is that's an excerpt from a world so the conceptual model of what you're capturing is you know the visible wavelengths of that picture of a tree from that particular angle and the metadata that was attached to the to the particular photo file that you captured so all that to say when we write down a note every time we write down a note we're actually using a conceptual model we're actually saying okay in my head here's what i'm thinking about what's important and salient about that thing in order to represent it in this bit of text and so you actually every time you write a note you're defining what type the type of note and you're doing it by the type of content you put in it so actually one of my supervisors or my my my supervisor uh in information systems i'm a phd candidate his name is jeff parsons and he wrote a paper a long time ago called the tyranny of classification and the idea here is that when we represent things in information systems we tend to do it by deciding first what the thing is so we say okay you know i have a that's a good example i have a chapter from a book here and i'm going to put it in my folder which is like my the main folder is library then the subfolder is books and the subfolder of that book of books is this book and the subfolder is chapters and then this is and that's a crude example but what if that idea what if that thing is actually not a chapter of a book to you what if you're capturing it as a key piece of your thesis i don't know then you might want to put it somewhere else and the problem is that by looking at where that thing is you're defining what it is and yet what it is from uh conceptually can be so many different things and so this is why i think we've seen flat structures become really popular in node systems because if you use links you use maps maps of content and you use tags and so on instead of folders you're not dealing with this tyranny of classification you're not defining what something is by where we're putting it we're actually letting it be itself and then using the properties of that thing to decide what it is when we use it and that was the point of the paper that's it's an almost agnostic way of approaching any bit of information you're saying i don't quite know who you are or what you are i know you're definitely this right now for me but i don't know for sure you're always that and i don't want to always put you there it's it's i don't know it's a it's kind of a curious way of approaching information that becomes knowledge as we start interacting with it right right and here's the here's one last piece on that the real worry that jeff had about classification and why it was tyrannical was because every time we classify something every time we store something by thinking about what it is first we actually go through this goes back to cognitive load and cognitive capacity we actually use features of our brain's ability to classify things to cut out parts of that thing and we lose it and so what jeff was worried about was when we're capturing data and he wasn't thinking about notes but when we're capturing data about something in the world and we decide say his his work is often around uh crowdsourcing and observational crowdsourcing so say you've got this project where you're looking at birds in the wild and you have this system that lets people see a bird and then they say that's a robin and so they say i saw a robin but uh what if that robin was sick you know or what if it for some reason was doing a dance and uh it's the first time ever that you've you've seen a robin do a dance that any ecologist in the world has seen a robin do a dance well your system only lets people say i saw robin so you're actually missing all these interesting attributes of the observation you're actually missing all these ideas that because you're structuring too early you are losing them and so if we decide that a note about a book is to contain these kinds of information then we aren't necessarily thinking about all the other pieces of information it might contain and there's a there's a tension there there's an issue yeah yeah to that point i guess personally what what i attempt to do is you know so bottom up doesn't allow for that structure when we make notes and we have we put whatever's currently relevant to us about an idea and we capture it into this container but then as that stuff starts to come together then we want to apply some structure and hopefully it's a little bit earned at that point and if that structure can remain fluid then it allows conversations to continue and you we can take it in different directions theoretically and practically i think that is a working model depending on some people's use cases which i eventually want to ask you about you said something interesting that you use project in obsidian you use it mainly for project management which was surprising to me because you're such a thinker and i thought you know where are you developing ideas or maybe you're just referring to it differently because it seems like you're you're taking information you're crafting it you're working with it you're refactoring it to make sense of things so i'm guess is it just semantics are you like where are you doing your sense making if not in something like obsidian honestly i think it's something that it's just something that i'm bad at do you know anybody running any courses on exactly how to you know practice i know it's yeah it's uh it's just a lack of attention to it so far i've been when i started using these tools i was looking for a way of managing my projects and you know this is this is the tyranny of classification what i'm calling a project is actually a deliverable that is a thought product arguably of a bunch of ideas that i'm putting together and so uh it's maybe an example of of what i was just talking about but i still have a habit of writing big pieces and that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is like i have i'll have a project note and the project note will contain the kind of writing that i'm doing and the tasks associated with it and the other relevant projects and the thought products that are going into it and what i like about that is i used to use you know i've used every task manager out there and then i used to use every writing app out there and so on and what obsidian gave me the power to do is put all those things in the same place i don't have to go open an omnifocus window with the project that i'm working on with the list of tasks that i have and look through that list of 20 tasks and identify where it fits in the paper i'm currently writing that's 20 pages long and then open that thing in word all of that was too much for me so instead i have tasks where they are like i have tasks right next to the paragraphs that they're associated with and i have thinking right next to that so so i do probably need to take what you're thinking in order to figure out how to how to use obsidian a bit more knowledge management directly so i think for me the way i i filter that is it's semantics i guess for me because you are doing idea development within your project management it's just you're very your use case if i was to say it out loud i might be incorrect your use case is so targeted and focused with what you you want to think around this area and so and you you want to have a deliverable there too so you you kind of have some sort of end you don't know how you're going to get there but you're eventually going to get to this place and so it seems like yeah so it seems like it's still it's it's doing what you need to it's just very targeted and you know you're doing all the the sense making as you go along yeah yeah and it's i mean i think i do think i'm doing it backwards it's like i i think i had a great uh chat with somebody on the obsidian forum about this the other day and people were very informative such a great place but i'm still stuck in like i'm a phd candidate i have deliverables i need to i need to do a thesis right i need to write papers for conferences and so the way my work tends to happen is like i will be like write thesis and then the thesis gets backwards generated from there instead of what i would like to do which is the i think the lyt model which is like here's all these ideas here's how they kind of fit together because they become interest here's how they become interesting things oh look i've got a pieces which is i think that's the like natural approach that's the more powerful approach but unfortunately the pressure alliance is uh another tyranny yeah does that acostan and this the zonka ahrens approach that he outlines the building yeah well hey that's great pretty quickly i think we should open it up to like some of the questions and hear from other people so the question from michael was what places evan think have in your system how is that distinct from obsidian i actually think obsidian could be a replacement for devon think i'm not quite there yet but the more that the devs do to support sort of different files and allowing us to do more with different files depending on your use case you might be able to switch if if you're familiar with everything i'll explain what it is in a second but you might be able to switch up sitting in with with devon think so devon think is is i think another kind of integrated thinking environment and nick we actually didn't get into what integrated thinking environments were why we were talking about that phrase so maybe we need to go back there yeah feel free but it's a way devon think was 15 is about 15 years old now it's a really early mac app that was really powerful and it lets you put files in there you can treat it like a note manager similar to obsidian and rome and so on but you can uh drive one of the more recent updates that they've done in devon think three was to allow you to add custom metadata to individual files so you can say have a pdf and list metadata on top of the pdf about you know what kind of uh paper it is that as it fits into whatever the project you're currently working in so it allows some more complicated metadata management that obsidian i don't think will do anytime soon but outside of that you can store files in dev and think and you can store notes in it and you can use it as a full text search engine of all those things so it's quite powerful and to answer michael's question more simply devon think index is my obsidian folder so i can actually i published a plugin a couple months ago called devin link and it lets you open the current if you index your obsidian folder in devon think you can just use the scripts that i provided and the plugin to just like jump back and forth between them so the exact same files that are in obsidian are in devon think thank uh you know all of the developers who've come before us for making plain text files a thing and devon think therefore adds a bunch of functions that once in a while i tap into so i like hypsidian as the sort of quick moving easy to navigate and organize uh system and then devon think itself sits on top of that as a sort of database layer that lets me do some fun things with full text search and so on and i'll store if i've got a pdf say that i'm reading i'll store all those in dev and think and use direct links an obsidian just out of habit when i started using opsi it didn't have as great support for pdfs and so on nowadays i might might have done something differently that's the short answer yeah yeah well that's pretty good and then i see there are some sub questions but i think we actually answered where theresa and she was kind of curious about how you use obsidian primarily for projects versus knowledge but i think we answered that that you're actually kind of doing it you're managing knowledge but it's through the lens of projects is that fair enough to say yeah i think that's fair to add to that a little bit i am i follow getting things done copyright david allen code 2001 uh a little loosely the way i think of it is like there are projects that sit within projects that's within projects that's one of the things that they didn't like about classical task managers and how they approach project management is like there tends to be like sort of a super folder and then a project and then after that it kind of starts to fall apart but you know my write a thesis project is actually a part of the overall project of achieving you know accomplishing a research stream and then some parts of that thesis are right chapters and some parts of those are run experiments and so that's how obsidian's linking tools help me think of these projects in a sort of different way from all those other task management tools is i'll have a project that to be accomplished needs all these other projects and they're all linked together so but yes most they're all knowledge projects so they're all uh driven from the kind of ideas that i write down right there from the text and so on and just having that phrase like that's what i mean those empowering phrases a knowledge project i know you're just kind of throwing that out there like casually but that's a way to look at different types of projects it's a knowledge project okay how can i use this within obsidian or you know rome or you know excellent so two options i'll give you a path that you can choose here ryan but okay i want to talk a little bit about ites or answer joel's question i think i should probably define it's a bit more so that people aren't aren't too scared of that idea so an ite is uh this idea that the notes apps that we're currently using actually provide a way like ides integrated development environments help developers manage code associated with a given goal ites help us manage thoughts and the current raft of notes apps that we're all excited about by eleanor the current apps a set of apps that we're all um excited about are actually ites and they are because they allow you to navigate your thoughts more effectively than previous sets of apps they allow you to organize those thoughts in new and interesting ways like using links and metadata they allow you to transform those thoughts by querying them and evolving them through writing and through a variety of different kind of plugins and then that third that the fourth thing the fourth thing that makes these notes apps ites is that they are highly extensible you can customize them with the community's development of with all the plugins and extensions that the community has developed and so a very quick example of um one of those ideas is i built and published yesterday or the day before what i call the qualitative analysis integrated thinking environment and the idea is that if you're doing research that involves qualitative analysis that is you're reading text you're deeply reading text you're trying to code that text for ideas and for content for topics and themes that it contains conventionally you would use something like maxqda or atlas.ti or nvivo which are expensive huge pieces of software and i suspect that people often don't use many other features in them and so if your use case is relatively simple and you're not used to those apps you might actually be able to get away with just using an obsidian vault so that's what i did i built out a obsidian vault that uses a set of specifically defined features in the vault specific plugins specific ideas specific workflows and then you can use that to accomplish this dedicated goal of doing qualitative analysis so i think most of what we are actually talking about today is a specific type of ite focused on knowledge management right focus on on managing a bunch of notes but you can actually think of ites as a variety of other tasks focus on a variety of other tasks and so another example of that is uh uh or sorry calistorian mark robertson's uh talked a lot in the various communities of these places about his history teaching rome vault rome graph and that's a specific task that he has fine-tuned a rome graph to do and just another example of how these things can get specific and through extension they can get a lot richer that's an it very nice yeah i don't know if any i'll post a link i wrote this up in a more robust way so if you want to review it you can dive right into that blog post and feel free to email me or whatever um it needs some jpegs it's kind of boring it's all text right now but uh if if you're if you're listening to this conversation then that article is required reading i mean you'll i'm just saying like if you're here you know you'll love it because it's it's really good and it's clear and there's a nice uh n-o-t-e framework in there as well worth checking out yeah yeah so now joel joel's asked joel you're not supposed to ask hard questions or be or be provocative but joel says it sounds like you're you are saying that the modes and structures for accessing information are part of the information itself to be productive provocative don't we need to distinguish the work of structuring curating from the actual developing content i don't know i'd like joel's thoughts on this obviously yeah i'm here i'm here hey when you were starting off it seemed like you were talking a lot about corridors and connections to different thoughts and it seems to me that a lot of the emphasis was on how things are connected rather than the work done of actually developing the individual thoughts but then at other times you seem to turn and say well no actually these are these are individual freestanding atomic thoughts and they can be connected to anything so i was just i mean it may be that both are true and that's the paradox of all of this sorry you're gonna say something else no that's just i'm just trying to provoke you yeah sure yeah i mean i don't think i have a good answer i think it is the the tension of the paradox that you know sometimes you do need to be thinking about how things are structured and other times you need to be in the weeds yeah i don't know uh kind of kind of lacking lacking more contribution there but it's a it's an interesting so so actually i know what i'll draw on and that is joel chan's ideas of janitorial work i don't know if joel's getting that from somewhere else but this idea that sometimes you need to be a janitor with your information you need to actually be doing cleanup work and you need to be sort of getting rid of the things that you don't need anymore and re-cleaning or cleaning up the links and the the metadata and the structures and then other times you're actually doing the thinking and i think joel if i'm correct joel chan argues that um janitorial work is the work uh that that actual process of doing the the organizing and the fitting things together and the deleting is actually a really important part of getting through your thinking and of managing your ideas does that relate at all am i on the mark what do you think you know absolutely absolutely i think something that eleanor said that classification is hard that's partly because thinking is hard but i think the the the tension is in when when does the janitorial work or the work of curation become a matter of just getting fiddly with things that you're just you're shuffling things around you're saying like oh this this relates to that this reminds me of that this is associated with that and you spend all the time on the linking and not enough on the thinking yeah yeah at the same time just having these separate these atomic thoughts and not and not connecting them to one another is also a problem yeah yeah so okay yeah thank you for for pushing a bit further and this is actually maybe not such a hard question after all because i have a a strong opinion but maybe a controversial one and that is that knowledge innovation so we've been talking about this stuff from like under the guise of knowledge management right pkm is knowledge management and i wonder like why the hell are we not why are men why are we managing knowledge what's the point of managing knowledge i actually think we should be thinking about it in terms of knowledge innovation and i say that because my master's thesis was on the innovation process and on innovation skills and how we educate innovators but they part of that contribution part of that product was the development merging of a bunch of different theories of innovation into a process and i can link that but the big picture idea is that every innovation and first of all innovation is anything that is new to the world new to your context or new to you so innovation doesn't need to be this brand new giant idea that is like going to blow away the previous paradigms you know just realizing that you should wake up earlier in the morning might be an innovation if it depends on uh something that you're something important to you but all innovations are driven by what i called a prompt so maybe you had a need maybe you had maybe just had a spontaneous idea that's cool too or maybe you had a question or a challenge that you're trying to resolve and so there's a chain of events that happen between that prompt and then actually applying it actually using whatever you do in between having a prompt and applying it to change the world change your world change your local world or change the the bigger world and so i actually would argue that janitorial work to bring it back the janitorial work can be fiddly can be useless if you're not driving it from a prompt if you're not driving it from a good challenge from a good question or a good good uh sort of issue that you're trying to resolve so i think we should be managing knowledge and this is the controversial part we should be managing knowledge for the purposes of innovation we should be in managing knowledge to try and respond to issues and problems and ideas that we have in our lives in order to do something different in the future that or be more resolved in whatever we're doing the same but it should be making a difference it should be for some given purpose so you're liquid it's fiddly when you're doing it to procrastinate i love where this conversation has gone because i think it's we're hitting on so many neat topics and knowledge innovation knowledge development kind of those are we could say it was somewhat similar and i think the broadest term is management that can fit it all so that unfortunately you know that's what it's currently mostly called but to your point and and i think where the most value is is when people are using these tools for as you're saying innovation for making new connections that bring meaning to to their world whether it's around them or internally and and it's so yeah i i feel strong alignment with what you're saying there and that and also to that point how janitorial work is both good and bad depending on how it's approached and and what the purpose around it is it's fantastic if it's forcing you to think not so much if you're just trying to clean up a bunch of metadata because you have a template and you're supposed to fill out 20 different metadata items that you forced upon yourself but aren't really earned yeah yeah or if you're trying to avoid some other deadline or yeah instead of instead of drawing new icons on a home screen you're trying to add specific metadata to a thing yeah thank you joel by the way wonderful provoking question and we're hitting the hour mark the only thing i know we have more questions we won't be able to get to them all but there's also a walkthrough of your messy main vault where you possibly do some strange things and i didn't want to make sure that we overlook that completely is that something you still want to share you want to focus on the questions yeah so i think i've peered that effectively through the talking about project management but one of the okay things that i do is i do sort of reviews symbols as a prefix for certain kinds of notes so i use the i just type into the chat a delta or a project symbol oh sorry a triangle to indicate that something is a project note and so i've got a lot of things in my vaults that are just like plain text titles and descriptive titles but then if something is a project i use that and that lets me use the quick switcher to very very quickly filter only the projects that i'm working on i've seen people use you know just p colon or whatever uh instead but i find it a really neat trick because it visually then shows what is a project and i do some other things with status to show whether or not a project is open or closed uh so actually i'll finish that box i keep typing i use that symbol open and then project to indicate that a project is still running it's not something that i've closed out and then i use like a closed dot and a triangle to indicate that something is is finished and i'm not really working with it so it gives me a really quick way of filtering when i'm when i'm using a quick quick switcher i'm interested in this a lot and and as it happens joel who i was just talking with joel a couple days ago i'm very interested in the conventions that might take root with us trying to solve you know a diverse set of uh problems in our own worlds and you know what what so i think you're onto something with the option eight on a mac with that bullet joel also mentions that that's a really good one i'm speaking for you joel so just this is all option uh forward slash you brought that one up and you also joel brought also brought up the uh spanish question mark which are all unicode like you know compliant and you know every system can read that well from my understanding so i just i'm nice the unicode coffee cup yeah oh nice okay so so i'm excited to see where that goes as well and see what kind of conventions naturally start to emerge in the next you know a few years everyone will be unique and different but i'm just kind of curious to see what what catches on so i think i think uh no well emoji are fine josh to quickly answer uh you just have to check the services and the operating systems you're using so dropbox for instance will often fight against emoji and yet for some reason doesn't have a problem with these unicode characters that we're typing in but i i don't you know don't go restructure your entire graph or your entire note system without checking making sure your your file isn't rejected by whatever you're using i will quickly say what was it going to say i'm wondering now if there's better ways of doing this so i've been using this as sort of work around really for a way of filtering files when i'm quickly opening and in that article that i posted earlier on um ites i talked about this concept uh of software where really these like very defined techniques are a kind of level on top of software that we're using to accomplish certain goals and i think what we'll see as these apps keep developing and as the plugins the ecosystem keeps getting richer and richer is we'll see people will take these ideas that users are are using as a work around and they'll actually create plugins and extensions that help accomplish those things without needing the hacky workarounds so i would love to just like tap a button to open only my project files and use metadata in the project files to dictate that because it is a pain in the ass to use these different symbols and to explain them to people whatever they ask about them and so i think that's a i think we'll see this sort of cycle where users do these neat techniques and then developers see them and say hey we can do that a little better and build it into the software with this plugin so that's a dream that would be that would be nice and and this hits on two things and i actually i was talking the reason i was talking with joel's because i hope to do a lighthouse with him more so like in october or november time frame but because he's huge into auto complete and and as far as retreat again i'm speaking for you so i'm gonna cut it short joel but just the the value how one symbol can help with your auto completion and retrieval but then the other side of it is collaborative purposes where if you're working with people in this collaborative environment can we agree upon uh symbols so we can communicate within a small team or whatever that this symbol means this and or but to your point that's where smart developers might solve the problem again without having the need for us to rely on on such things and we'll be very interested to see interesting to see how that gets solved the collaborative questions yeah they're very unresolved in my mind i think like lots of people are excited about collaboration and about uh multiplayer integrated thinking environments and i think we're gonna get there but it's the software that needs to be resolved before the software can actually really work it's the like techniques and ways of working together that and it goes back to that idea about information systems right if i'm representing a thought and you talk about this neck if i'm talking representing a thought about a rock and it's actually a different actual real world thing that i'm talking about and you think it's your real world version of iraq we're not gonna agree even though we think we're agreeing and yeah that can get it can seem subtle but then it could run into some major issues and i know also joel anderson is working on that too these kinds of collaborative efforts uh do you believe consciousness emerges from integrated information i don't i try not to think too much about those kinds of ideas i think that uh actually i do have a strong opinion on that and that is that consciousness to me is uh or at least sentience or whatever can only come from abduction can only come from this like sort of jump in logic that we actually can't really get computers to do quite yet at least i don't know if we'll ever get there i've got some skepticism about ai and machine learning's ability to do abduction to do what charles sanders peers talked about as like this jump from uh inference to a possible solution than the testing that solution so if any of the any people in the chat are philosophers feel free to you know tear me apart on that but that's that's kind of where i'm thinking about sentience and consciousness is all it's all about that innovation uh idea it's all about driving to change the world and change the universe so that's where i think consciousness needs to come from integrated information is part of that but that abduction you everyone everybody in this room is doing abduction constantly because they are integrating information and that from that integration you are having some separate idea that doesn't come directly from it it's a gestalt effect and we're not quite there and just just piling information together is not the same as the the gestalt of of looking at it differently abduction would that be fairly similar to saying the phrase that's unscientific like lateral thinking i mean is that sort of in the same ballpark abduct away yeah it's related yeah okay yeah okay uh i actually wrote a post i can't even remember the details of it i wrote a post that i can link about what abduction is and and why why it might matter let me pull that up and throw it in the chat but uh uh it's a big issue to me that we don't often um think about when we get excited about ai and and so on i think there's a lot to be resolved about abduction it's also related to intuitiveness uh so i said sent the link tenush talked asked about systems thinking systems thinking is seeing the world as an interconnected set of phenomena and not as you know but it's actually related to that just salt idea so a system behaves differently a system is a set of phenomena that if you looked at at face value they look like a bunch of things that sort of sit together but then as they interact they lead to emergent dynamic behaviors that are hard to hurt to predict and guess at my main wheelhouse is actually systems thinking and systemic design it's a way of looking at the world and at complex phenomena and trying to develop strategies to change them do i integrate it into my ite workflow i think you're seeing some pieces of systems thinking in the ways that i'm thinking about these uh ideas that when you write a note the note doesn't sit when you write a note and you link it to a bunch of other notes the note is no longer just itself it's actually what it represents based on the context all these other pieces so that's a quick example but i'm not very deliberate about it so you know tunisia if you have more ideas about systems thinking um and how it works with it's then by all means right away and publish it and share with me i'd love to read it crosby john crosby asks what is your mental squeeze or pain point threshold in transforming captured in content uh from a developing state to an evergreen note i think john that goes back to my current restrictions in my phd candidate life where i don't get to do that because i have to start with that idea of what the evergreen note is as in a paper a conference paper a thesis whatever and so i really start with what that objective is and my practice right now really just involves a lot of cognition a lot of things that are happening in my head as i you know care for my baby and go for a walk and stuff and that and and deep reading so reading articles and and thinking about these issues i really do want to as i've hinted at follow the lyt approach at least a little bit and get better at that idea of having all these nascent concepts and then putting them together but i don't think i'm very good at it let me see i think i can quickly answer these these next three and then maybe i'll have to stop so i don't use a lot of front matter or metadata but i'd like to use it more actually the only thing i really use it for right now is i use a service called blocked to publish my blog blog.im it's an excellent service that you can use with dropbox or git and it allows you to take a set of markdown files and and hit uh essentially publish them just as a blog post and so blot recently announced both double bracket linking so wiki linking and support for fenced metadata at the top and so i used lots sort of pieces there to add summaries and so on but i don't use it i'll use actual metadata very much michael asked how i'm submitting to the tyranny of classification i think systemically is the answer to go back to what i just said about tanoosh i don't actually worry too much about how these things fit together i just sort of sometimes i'll the only time i use a folder is when i've got a bunch of assets that fit together so i need to write a document like a docx file and i have a pdf and i have a bunch of images that i've made for it so put all those in the same file folder and then put that folder you know in notes but that's the only thing i really do i don't worry otherwise about how my my things fit together and then i'll naturally use links to fit things together and i use a kind of approach like maps of content in order to organize these things you saw my projects file that's the kanban board that's like the main organizing uh scheme that i use across the whole thing thank you for your graciousness there ryan i mean you hit most of them questions will keep flooding in and they are a great question so apologies that we can't get to them all but uh they will be saved and then on the side maybe they can be addressed offline but i mean i'll say this i i have uh i have limited access to my inbox these days but if you write me and then if you're really keen you can keep writing me and eventually i might write you i will try not to feel too bad about not replying but if i get the chance to respond and you're really keen on dealing with some of these things and by all means reach out i'll post my email very awesome of you well hey let's give ryan one more raised hand zoom round of applause so if you can see all those hands if you have the participants paint open yay no but seriously like this was so enriching and enlightening it's overdue too i know that we've wanted to talk for a while and i'm glad that we're able i'm glad we're able to do it this way because uh it's really enriching to get everyone's thoughts and feedback as we go it's kind it's like this i don't know it's just a great learning environment and i think it was handled fairly good with the the webinar format decent enough where you could share demo went perfectly right yeah as always [Laughter] but uh but yeah that's another thing you have those amazing icons and i know those are custom to you but if i'm just kind of yeah yeah when i when i whoa when i write up the shortcuts and how they work i will gladly share them with the icons but the icons are sort of half drawn by me and half of the like little colorful bits are taken from free pick which is a free icon service freepik.com please and sue me free pick but uh yeah i'll show them it's awesome that each in each background the icon background it's different it's not like like you just used one you reposition the background so i mean that's attention to detail and that that that shows all the work that you do that that too that too but like your website everything you do has a certain level of care like a master craftsman i always think about like renaissance italy but yeah you'd you'd be the master crafts person making you know sculptures and spending years to make it just right sure yeah thanks no i don't know if that's a good thing but i'll take it as a compliment working on multiple projects spending years making it just right so you because your output's very high too so yeah i'm glad it looks like that you know to the whole audience anything we missed or anything you'd like to say last words i don't think so thanks everybody for the attention thanks for bearing with me as i screwed up shortcuts but yeah if you have anything anything else feel free to write it thanks again ryan and bye everyone thanks for being here and making this umami experience as as full of the mouth feel as it certainly was all right we'll see yeah thanks all see ya [Music] [Music] you
