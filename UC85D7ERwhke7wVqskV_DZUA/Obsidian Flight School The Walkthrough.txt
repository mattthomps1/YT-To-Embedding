hey cadet and welcome to obsidian flight school let me show you what this is all about here's the walkthrough after you download flight school it'll show up it'll be a folder wherever you download it to you open it up through obsidian which i've already done and then will look like this flight school arrival welcome to flight school and this is sort of your engaged hands-on orientation and so there are four ways to orient yourself this arrival note and three others checklist hanger and map so depending on how you want to go about it you get to choose your own adventure now i prefer that you go through the flight school hanger and we can see what that looks like and let's go into preview mode and yeah you are here because you want to improve how you can pilot your linking your thinking ship which i would call the light ship that allows you to fly around your pcam planet your personal knowledge management world of information so what does that look like well if you go through the hangar there's a basic training wing and there are four legs to the program there's obsidian formatting there's an obsidian setting section themes and my favorite area which is the core maneuvers just by mastering the core maneuvers you're going to be so much faster with using link-based applications specifically obsidian then after you get through the basic training wing let's fold and collapse that you get into the piloting wing and this is where you really take things to that next level we work on the interface working with text navigation and some other keyboard combos supporting those two wings are the instruments wing where there's a display panel we can look at all the sidebars top bars ribbons what they're all about plugins so we can expand what we do hotkeys so we can i mean we've spent a lot of time on hotkeys that's why i say it's best if you have a keyboard special functions because there are some gray area tools that we want to look at and the graph view which everyone's so enamored by how do we make the most of that so that's the instrument's wing and then supporting everything else also is the resources wing so we can look at the plugins through a data scope same with the hotkeys those are kind of two valuable notes there we can look at auxiliary actions that don't kind of fit anywhere else all the single simulations in one place we can look at the glossary and faq so if you made it all the way through that let's go back to the arrival note so i'm going to close this pane now we're back in the arrival note there are also workspaces that we go over so for instance if i want to open up map view we can see the four main notes side by side panes and this is pretty cool choose your own adventure so if you want to go through the arrival map this is kind of like the very very start but then you can say well i kind of like a checklist so i'm going to make the checklist my main note that i can orient myself around and then you can see basic training wing and the different things to complete you can look at the piloting wing the different things to complete and it keeps going or like i just showed you you can go through the hanger and experience more of the the narrative route of learning or last a lot of people like the map view and this allows you to see the most links and takes you through again we see basic training the different places within basic training the different places within the piloting wing including the simulations that you have in front of you and then the supporting sections like the instruments wing and the resources wing all in all there is so much for you to do here but let's hop in somewhere where should we go i think a nice section might be if we hop into the core maneuvers and let me close the other notes so we just look at core maneuvers and here we go core maneuvers master your core navigational abilities and experience and so there are a lot of movements there are some movements i should say that are so foundational you must master them at all costs this is what you want to do this is how you want to do it and we haven't even opened the sidebar but here's what you see in the sidebar these are those four notes to make sure you get everywhere you need to go and if you ever decide you want to hit command n or command shift n and you create a new note and here's my new note well where does that go there's a folder just for your notes so you can see i created another note recently but here's that note that i just created so let me go ahead and delete that note we're back here there's that sidebar we have this sidebar a lot of different things that you can do here collapsing results looking at the tags looking at the graph seeing where core maneuvers branches off to and this kind of gives you a sense of the the breadth of flight school because it's deceptively big and here you can see all the different notes that are connecting to this one note and there are quite a few so this is just the tip of the iceberg but i'd like to welcome you again cadet and if you choose to jump into this further i hope you have a wonderful time becoming faster more skilled and more confident using this wonderful node application that we call obsidian [Music] [Music] [Music] you
