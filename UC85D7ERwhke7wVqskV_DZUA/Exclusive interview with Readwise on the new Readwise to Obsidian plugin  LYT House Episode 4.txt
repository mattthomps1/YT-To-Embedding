[Music] yeah well yeah thanks for joining me here today and hopping into the lighthouse where we're going to dive into kind of a really specific integration which is readwise a very amazing app that we will be learning about and how it integrates with this app called obsidian that'll be the big focus i'm sure we're going to go on a few tangents and rabbit holes bunny trails and all sorts of things in between but we'll also leave this call i'm sure figuring out how to use this integration and how to optimize it so i'm really looking forward to that just to kick things off um i know many of you have probably heard of read wise but we all are still a pretty small niche product so i'm assuming that a bunch of you haven't heard of it so just to give some context before i jump into our obsidian integration i just want to explain what read wise is and what read wise does so i started read-wise with my co-founder tristan he might be in here i'm not sure uh back in 2017 um so we've been working on this for about four years now and what readwise initially did it was a browser extension that you would install in chrome and it would make it easy for you to get your kindle highlights so if you guys read on a kindle device every time you take a highlight assuming it's a book that you purchased from amazon that highlight is then synchronized into the cloud at this webpage read.amazon.com notebook and while that's cool amazon makes it really hard for you to export your highlights from that page like you can go in there and you can kind of like manually cut and paste them but it's kind of hard to manage so our chrome extension would go and do that for you in the background when the browser was open make it easy to liberate those highlights and then once we had those highlights then we would help you get some value out of them by our first value prop and what we started readings with which was a a feature we call the daily review and it would just be an email of a random assortment of five highlights sent to you every morning and people really loved that and resonated with it and over time we started to add more and more reading apps kindle is like 80 to 90 of the ebook space but people are doing a lot of other forms of digital reading going to uh the dashboard now to show you all the different sources that we support um so you know after we had kindle then we added apple books unfortunately it's a little less convenient with apple books and with kindle we added google play books we added the real later apps like insta paper and pocket which have highlighting we added twitter so you can save both individual tweets as well as twitter threads uh medium and we just expanded all the different sources so now we became kind of like a zapier or like middleware that would make it easy for you to gather all your highlights into one place and once we started doing that then around like late 2019 2020 there was this explosion in the note-taking space you might call it or maybe like the tools for thought space or personal knowledge management everyone has their own term and people started asking us look well now that we have all our highlights in one place we want to get them into our note-taking tool so we started with you know the og note-taking tool evernote and then we added notion in rome obsidian has obviously stormed onto the scene over the past year i personally love obsidian that's what i use for my own note-taking tool and then they they made their plug-in system publicly available to developers like us a couple months ago and as of last week we officially shipped our read-wise official plug-in there were a couple community plugins that would tap into the revised api to import your highlights but we made our own which has a couple key uh differences which i'll show you through right now but before i move on anything that i left out for your audience nick you think that was good i mean i think it's good for me right now that's it's a nice overview and that's the thing like read-wise you've always struck me as a brand that i trust and i used it several years back and then just because of the nature of what i was up to moving to the entertainment industry focusing more on crafts and trades and that sort of thing i i didn't need the functionality and then coming back to it now and seeing what you're doing with this obsidian plug-in that's kind of re-inspired my my love of well-made apps like yours and how it can fit into the workflow and so i'm kind of excited to jump into the integration as well this is a great overview thanks yeah i mean before obsidian we also had a markdown export that a lot of our users were using you could turn all your highlights into a zip folder of markdown files and then import them into obsidian but that obviously had a lot of drawbacks namely you do it once and it's great but what happens when you start reading thereafter so that's what this plugin aims to solve so this is a fresh um obsidian vault on my machine with no real customization other than i've already ran the plug-in once just to give you an idea i have 35 000 highlights so the it does take a little bit here you can see well i think it'll say my number of highlights here so it takes a little bit of time to run 36 000 highlights now um so i ran it right before this and here you can see the output but before i get into there um i think everyone here is advanced enough to know how community plugins work and to go and search for it there are a couple read wise plugins ours is the one called read wise official um here you can see our readme we'll be adding community resources down here as folks make helpful like walkthroughs and guides is that how they use the plugin and then once you install it there'll be a screen before this it'll only have one call to action which will be connect to read wise you click that it'll take you to [Music] this page right here the obsidian page will connect and then you have to come back to obsidian to run the sync and you run that by hitting initiate sync or you can also do it from the command panel and just search for read wise you can do sync your data now and it will do your first export depending on how many highlights you have that may take a couple minutes or if you don't have many it should be relatively instant and so for for people using obsidian um with daniel hit there and one of i hope you're using this already but one of those awesome awesome hot keys is command p which pulls up the command palette and that way you don't have to remember the command what was it how do i find sync and all you have to remember is read wise very easy to remember and then sync your data now so command p or on a windows it's is it alt control okay yeah awesome i uh i come from the world of finance where i got locked into microsoft excel so i'm still on a windows machine to be made fun of by everyone on our team but it is what it is i get it i get it yeah so you know that's all you need to do to get started with the plug-in it obviously has a lot more depth from there if you want to go in and customize things to your bespoke preferences uh which if you're using obsidian you probably are that kind of power user that has a specific format in mind and there's there's no way to anticipate all of them so i think the major feature of this export is this ability to use custom formatting by default it's toggled off but you can toggle it on and what you get is a whole templating engine where you can go and tweak a majority of the output so you can get this dialed into your own preferences uh it was very interesting when we we first shipped the private beta of this just to get initial feedback uh we had no idea that this whole data view plug-in like yaml front matter thing was a thing in obsidian but that was overwhelming feedback early on so for example if you use the dataview plug-in or you use the animal front matter you can come down to this section here you know and begin filling in your your front matter however you want you can also change the title um so that'll be the first line on any of the exports if i turn this into edit mode right now i have it to be a heading one with the title of the book then there's a whole section called page metadata this is another thing that our plugin does that's kind of hard to replicate in the open source world just because we've been aggregating hundreds of millions of highlight data so here you can insert the author name you can see that i've chosen to use the wiki link around it you can insert the full title what that means is a lot of titles have like a short title and then they've got like a colon plus subtitle so this would be the the longer title um then you can have the category right that would be like a book article podcast tweet whatever um then within read wise we have a concept of document tags so a tag that you can apply to the book or the article i'm just taking one one step back there so with category that's also something that read wise is interpreting is that accurate that's right so in your library let me see the best place i've got three of these open um so in your library we we in general will interpret like a tweet as a tweet um as a category but you can come in and you can adjust you know what the category is um sometimes like a pdf will be interpreted as an article when it's actually a book or whatnot but you can come in and tweak that and then when it's exported to obsidian it'll have the updated tag here and i use the tag the hashtag convention for for this which is like a nice to have and nice to filter on but i this is my personal preference of just how i use hashtags versus wikileaks and the document tags are kind of the same thing um whoops wrong one i can come in here and i can add a document tag to the top uh and then finally there's the url of the document that would be if it's an article or something so that way you can go back to the original source and check it and that's that's page metadata then we get into this thing called the highlights header which is probably the least intuitive section on this page but if you go into here you'll notice that you know we have the title which we talked about we have the metadata which included this book cover which looks nice in preview mode this right here is the what's known as the highlight header so it's separating my highlights beneath it from everything above it and then if i were to continue reading this book after i did an initial export it would insert a new header beneath it which gets into a really important topic you can see this new highlights added it gets into a really important topic because when people export their their highlight data or their annotation data to a note taking app like this it's very common that they're going to go back and start to mess around with the text that's up here for some people that might be like taking a note beneath you know for others that might be you know linking their their thinking so to speak and creating wikileaks within the highlights so we want to be very very very careful never to go back and overwrite something you did so this plugin is entirely what we call append only it will only ever nice add stuff to the very bottom so you know if you edited stuff and then you took new highlights and how to take smart notes on your kindle and you woke up in the morning what i would get based on how my template is set is i would get you know this at the bottom it would look like this and then it would be a date time uh appended there and then the new highlight would be down here does that make sense it does and that's that's really part of the holy grail of things i mean i think auto updating wherever we can add that within our personal knowledge systems that's very important because for me to have trust in something what i do is i'll go into books that i've read and right there underneath the highlight i want to connect it you know using prompts like hey this reminds me of blank and now now i'm off in this other space and my my big fear with these these products until up until now really is that if i do all this stuff and then i resync that it's going to overwrite i'm going to lose the real valuable stuff for me which is my personally meaningful connections to this book and how it relates to everything else in this rich tapestry this web of other ideas memories that i've encountered and so what you're telling me which is pretty amazing is that this won't overwrite it only appends and that seems small but it's actually quite huge because now we can trust and rely on our note making space to to always be there and not um be overwritten yeah that's huge you mentioned that that's the the holy grail actually i would say the holy grail which someday will be possible for us it's just that this like block-based architecture is so new the holy grail for us which hopefully in the next year or two is possible is what we call bi-directional sync so if you were to update something here this would go back into read wise and update the record in read-wise so now the two are in total sync it's going to be interesting to see which note-taking app enables that first right now we've had to basically hack or exporting on the top of notion and rome because neither have uh public apis uh it might be possible that obsidian is first just because they're moving so quickly on the plug-in system we'll say but that to us is the holy grail that's pretty cool i wasn't aware of that that's awesome yeah obsidian makes me think of um i'm trying to think of this thing because it allows all these apis like to connect to it i might be using that incorrectly but it reminds me of like howell's moving castle it's like this thing that you can like connect all these parts to and it just seems like it's this customized version of whatever works for your for your bespoke needs you know um and so it's pretty wild to think about how it could be first because you know right now your developers like oh no with what's daniel saying out loud that's a pretty hard one to solve um but that would be pretty wild the bi-directional syncing yeah um we can't wait and then uh on this topic of revises append only so a lot of times when people are getting this all set up and getting it dialed in they'll want to do a couple tests so there is a way to do that i'm going to go kind of off script here rather than walking through all this different templating so like let's say you want to um like re-export something but it's really really really easy to do in obsidian compared to notion of roam and all you have to do is you have to come in and you have to delete the export so i have this article open to kind of demonstrate let me see if i can find it here i'm hitting ctrl o it's called here's how the metaverse here it is so you can see that i i highlighted this using the read wise web highlighter and exported it and here's that highlight right here if i if i click this by the way it'll it'll take me back into the page all right but now let me take another highlight sorry let's just highlight this real quick so now let me rerun the the sink might take a second i mean what we want to see is we want to see this is the original highlight and then we'll see new highlights added then there'll be a daytime and then this new highlight that i just took at the bottom and so on the right there are a few building exports and as we see that that means it's working right i mean is there anything that's right yeah and we've gotten a we only launched this publicly last tuesday so we're literally a week into this and gathering feedback for a v2 um one piece of feedback we've gotten is that these are annoying and one of the community plugins figured out how to tap into this bottom status bar so i think we're going to do that in the v2 that's coming um very cool but yeah this is basically the server saying that it's doing work and i just have an egregious number of highlights okay so here you go you can see that it was is added um at 12 21 my local time is 12 22. so that's the append only relationship uh but now let's delete this and then if i rerun the sync it may take a second uh when it comes back in it won't have that new highlights added header divider because now it's a fresh note we basically have refreshed it so if you came in to here and you want to play around like maybe a lot of people don't want bullets for their highlights they want block quotes like i was using by default it will be a bullet um i already changed it to be a black quote you might like mess around with that delete the file resync it make sure it looks good and then when you're happy with it we re-import everything very cool metaverse all right yeah and there you can see it re re-exported fresh and now these are each individual block quotes rather than that divider so that's a pretty good example especially with articles i can see that being quite helpful as opposed to it depends what everyone's workflow is because with the book you're probably taking that you know those um you know concepts wrestling with them and then making some connections so then that's where i just loved and i'm fine with the the append where it goes below you know because that's actually it's it is more it's contextual in its own way it's saying well this was taken later and so if that's five years later that is greatly impactful about when you're trying to recall it you're kind of you're choosing to use your own personal chronological experience to recall information in that book versus using something like the the arbitrary table of contents so yeah i'm really fine with just the append with highlights at the bottom another piece of feedback we've gotten over the past week is we do have the highlight date that you took it there are some exceptions there like we don't get that data perfectly from kindle but as long as you're consistently syncing we can get pretty close and people want that as a variable that they can add into their highlight template so we can also add the date but the highlight was taken as another piece of metadata so that's on our b2 road wow um what else is on the v2 road map so uh yeah good question so the first thing that's on the roadmap probably the most requested thing is there's no way right now in the template to edit the folder name and file name convention if you don't like these folders you can flatten them into one folder up here by this group categories and folder if you turn this on or off but in terms of being able to change these names if you do like the folders you know we do have international folks who are like we don't want the english names here so folder naming and then file naming convention because obviously the file name is what's used as the um reference throughout the rest of obsidian right what i mean by that is you know if i come here it'll try to auto complete seven powers people might want more customization like they might want seven powers dash or hyphen the author name so folder and file name templating is the number one requested feature since we've gone live that i think we're gonna be able to accommodate there might be a technical issue but i'm 90 confident we'll be able to accommodate um the second most requested feature for v2 would be to be able to use this plug-in on mobile um i i don't think there should be any issues with that we just need to be very careful that if you run this on desktop and then you run it on mobile that you won't get two of everything or have like a duplication issue um and then and then just a couple more variables in this templating those are the the main things that have come up yeah it's good to get your insights on that because uh i do think this is a crowd myself included i mean they're part of my whole thing is i want to get people actively thinking more but there are times and part of that active thinking can go into the world of fiddling and fiddling's fun and that's what we can do with the settings here i think this a lot of people who have joined us in the lighthouse that they're fiddlers as well and you know renaming the folders renaming the file names uh that's that's pretty cool because then you can add your emojis you can do whatever it is um i like to actually go chronologically so i like to add the actual year that the book came out and just kind of build build sense through the chronological order of things totally oh and then the other thing that's also quite requested is to be able to filter what gets exported um when i expand this this will show every single probably have 2 000 documents in here right now you can only do it based on time but uh we're looking into being able to subset like only export my books or only export my tweets what have you and that's that's also on the roadmap that's pretty cool yeah i mean so just to quickly walk through the other template options here this one right here highlight this is probably the the meatiest one this controls what individual highlights look like when they're exported so here you can see that i've exported this as a block quote in obsidian you need to have a new line between block block quotes otherwise they smash together um you can see that i'm also exporting this link at the end for view view highlight to go back to the original you can see that that's kind of embedded in here with the highlight location um so that's what this highlight thing is modifying also if i had notes or tags let me go over to how to take experiments um if i have highlights or tags for me i export those as a sub bullets you know tags colon and then the note uh the the tags themselves in wikilink format some people will swap that to be a hashtag and then my note that i took while i was reading it below um so that's what this one is controlling uh we talked about the yaml front matter at the very beginning even though this comes low in the template just because it's by default disabled this obviously will be the front matter at the top of the markdown file and then this final one is called sync notification this is much more relevant in rome which you know by default embeds linked references onto pages a little bit more aggressively than what obsidian does where it's kind of relegated to a side panel but this this will populate a file um which will probably also customize it'll populate a file in the read wise folder called like read by sync notifications and every time readwise does a sync and adds new content to your vault it will write something there based on whatever template you put in here so that can be a good way to kind of back link and get stuff onto your daily note if you have a daily note workflow and you have a way of linking references okay and just zooming out so this is i'm not a programmer and i was able to work with all this to kind of have my own custom settings but this is python a form of python is that accurate or what is the language this is called the jinja2 template yeah a templating engine and if ever you're confused you can always just hit the documentation here [Music] and this will take you to our help page and here it will give a lot of suggestions i need to fix this it's all bolded but uh i love the documentation i and you know because i think i was looking at it before you went official dance the documentation wasn't ready there so you can still figure it out without the documentation i am really excited though to dive into that um since i am not coming from a programming background i'm sure i'm going to learn quite a bit from that and then you can always find the documentation within obsidian itself and then you know because we are a paid product um we are providing a service here we take customer service and customer success very seriously um so you can always just email us and myself aaron angie will be very responsive uh both with feedback and with questions or comments another exciting thing and that's where i'm new to this world so i'm probably speaking outside of my area of expertise but it seems like there are some commonalities really between how read-wise how you've set up what you do and how the obsidian team has set up what they do the things that stand out to me is how responsive you are to feedback from everybody and how good naturally how you take it with good nature it's kind of hard you know when everyone's asking for a million different features and then the other one that's kind of interesting because i was doing some research into you know how how everyone started how you you guys started read wise and you aren't taking vc money you're bootstrapping which is also what obsidian's up to i know that's kind of off of the the um the sync between read wise and obsidian but i'm just kind of curious you know why was that decision made what what are your thoughts overall on what that does you know not having bc money yeah i mean tristan and i like i mentioned we started in 2017 and we worked on it for about a year as kind of like a side project i mean i remember describing this back in 2017 like oh a browser extension that gets your kindle highlights and resurfaces them to you like people would not think that's the most interesting thing to be spending your time on um at that time we would use words like space repetition um and people would look at us like we had two heads we're fortunate in that the past year or two these have have entered a little bit of like the early mainstream but um in 2018 a year after working on this we had to decide like all right are we going to continue to work on this and if so how are we going to capitalize the business um and we are not like dogmatic bootstrappers like there's this whole crowd of like indie hackers who are very anti-vc for a variety of reasons we're pretty um agnostic when it comes to like what you know vc versus bootstrapping at the end of the day we just want to do what's best for the business and what's best for the business is what's best for our customer and what's best for our customers we're a very niche product we we cater very deeply to a very small niche of user out there and if we took bc we would be forced to go and uh expand our offering to go after a larger market and kind of dilute our value proposition to our power users so that was ultimately what drove the decision to fund this business through revenues as opposed to raising venture capital and uh you know looking back with the benefit of like three years now it definitely was the right move and we're glad we did it it definitely took a while before we got to a place where we felt that good it wasn't really until like late 2019 early 2020 when our space you know thanks to tools like obsidian and rome and notion really exploded uh that that we were in a good position but now uh we're in a pretty solid place and and very happy that we were able to kind of stay focused on our core customer rather than you know go go after some bulge in the market and we really respect the way the obsidian guys are are doing things like there's a lot we can learn from them their ability to foster community such as yours it's just been unbelievable they definitely have a lot of foresight when with how they built this to be kind of plug-in first and very very very customizable um we're definitely very impressed with what they've done yeah well hey thanks for providing that sort of perspective to the conversation and i having that sort of agnostic approach the vc and how you know for for people using read wise understanding where you're coming from and what your your goals are and how you prioritize i think is is valuable to know because there's an investment it goes both ways it's not just you know the monthly or the annual but it's also you know do we do we trust everyone here to steward their product in a way that meets my personal needs or you know so it's really great getting that insight i think um we're gonna going to open it up for q a pretty soon here but i want to make sure we also cover anything else how are you doing so far with everything there daniel is there anything that we're we should still uncover yeah i mean just a couple other aspects of the plug-in that we didn't hit um you can notice here my vault is named read-wise but within this vault there's a folder named capital r read wise which contains all my my highlight um you can change the name of that from readwise to whatever you might prefer using this option within the plugin you can also customize uh how often the sync runs right now i've got it set to manual meaning i need to either hit this initiate sync or use the command panel like we showed at the very beginning in order to trigger resync alternatively i can set it to run periodically and this will tell the obsidian plug-in go check the rewi servers if there are new highlights that i took between the last sync and now then update my vault there's another sync option down here which is what i use sync automatically when i'm sitting open so when i open this vault it will trigger this plugin and it will search um it's really up to you what you prefer and then this final option resync delete files this is on by default so if i want to refresh if i want to refresh one of these just because maybe the table of contents didn't come in right or maybe i decided to tweak my template all you have to do is come in here delete the file trigger resync and then everyone everything will come in so this is the final plugin options i do want to make everyone aware of two power user features i mean when we originally built these it was like 90 we were 90 certain no one would ever use these but they the usage has kind of blown our minds but you'll notice that like how to take smart notes has this very very nice table of contents here and you'll notice that most of my books do the way you get this in to both read-wise and then subsequently into obsidian or notion or roam or evernote whatever you're using is you use a feature that we call inline tagging so we built this to be kind of reading app agnostic it doesn't matter what you're in and what you do is while you're reading as you come across you know the chapter heading or the section heading or the part heading is you highlight it okay and then you take a note and you start that note with a period or a dot and then an h which is you know synonymous with like heading and then the heading hierarchy right so if the book has parts and chapters the parts would be h1s the chapters would be h2s and then what this does is when readwise imports these highlights right now the source is the read wise browser extension but it could also be kindle or apple books or instapaper it knows to translate this into the book's table of contents so that's the first thing related to this is you can also add tags while you're reading and you do the same thing just by taking that period and then you could type this is my tag obviously it can't identify spaces that's why i'm using hyphens here but when this imports into read wise this will be converted into a tag and then you'll see that tag kind of dropped in right into [Music] the note which is pretty cool because like i have not come in here and linked anything and like already you can see that why is this not here we go like this is just by virtue of me tagging while i read creates this insane knowledge graph um so that's that's a feature worth noting for power users so so as you make a highlight you make a note hit period and it's either h or anything else will become a tag h1 h2 h3 all that stuff otherwise it will become attack yeah i think that i think that covers kind of the ins and outs of the plugins um unless there any yeah anything you can think of that i missed nick that answers all my questions and gave me more insights about the road map for this plug-in i mean i think that's one of the other things i'm looking for is you know dependability and i i really like where read wise has been where it's going and so i feel very good about using this and it's now a part of my workflow since it's so new i haven't really used it um excessively and also because we're getting ready for a few other things so i haven't been reading quite as much lately but it is pretty freaking awesome so this is this is lovely and i think we're about ready then to open it up for q a i'm going to start with luke's question here what plugin is daniel using to highlight website articles is that the read wise plugin or a third party oh good question so this is a read-wise browser extension we haven't actually gone live with this it's um still in development but uh if you email hello rewise.io aaron and i will see that and we can set you up with the beta version but you could be using hypothesis here you could be using any of the other extensions we're integrated with if you prefer the cool thing about hours is that you can highlight images so this image is highlighted with this text so if i run this sync this might take a second i keep forgetting the name of this metaverse article here it is if we give this a second it should come in and it'll have the image you probably also notice like here it's got the italics and here it's also got the hyperlink that was contained within this highlight so we're the only highlighting tool i know of that's preserving formatting and taking taking images in oh yeah here you can see the image um wow this is a little janky but why did it do that i think it probably just smashed um here we go but yeah we'll we'll be releasing this in like the next month or two this this browser extension right here hey daniel um david sparks has a question he's asking will the read wise web highlighter plug-in get safari support as well so safari historically apple has made it very difficult to port browser extensions from chrome which has a dominant market share of the browser market to safari which has a very small minority so as developers when they keep rug pulling on us you know and creating weeks of work for us for no reason it's very hard for us to willingly support safari which i know is frustrating as so far as your preferred browser that being said safari recently made it easier to port extensions over so it is on our roadmap to do and um as paul knows we're going to be porting this to safari pretty soon but that's i'm just giving you some context as to why it's not like something we do out of the gates it's just very frustrating they keep changing their standards and it creates a lot of unnecessary work for no reason i i think uh you must know this but the the idea of the read wise highlighter uh plug-in as is is generating a lot of excitement in the in the chat and otherwise that's uh that's pretty cool yeah just email if you guys want to get on the private beta just feel free to email me and aaron and we can hook you up daniel um where does firefox stand on the plugin list we have this for firefox firefox uses um chrome extensions but they have a more stringent uh approval process but we've been approved by them all right i'm a firefox user so it's good to hear david sparks hope you're doing well david um can you show again how you are doing block quotes and getting the blocks for into individual quotes instead of groups uh yes so the one by default there'll be a dash here um for a bullet so i switched that dash to a black quote and then the most important thing is i insert a new line down here if you don't insert this new line it'll smash together if you do put the new line here then it will separate and when it comes into obsidian it will have this very important space here which makes it look separate if i get rid of this space you can see that it emerges that's just i don't know why obsidian chose to render black quotes this way but they must have had a good reason very cool very cool next one up if we use dataview is it much better to include all hashtag metadata as a yaml at the top of the page i have never played with dataview i only learned about it while in like the late stages of polishing this integration so i would actually defer to you nick if you're a dataview expert yeah i actually am not i'm pretty slow to the game with adopting dataview although i think it's great and its functionality is fantastic if we use dataview is it much better to include the metadata as yaml at the top of the page well i guess my answer to that would be i don't have a strong need to use yaml and sometimes it forces me to add things i don't want to add so with that in mind as i'm using data view i'm just going to add the double colon which allows it to be inline where data view can recognize so you know instead of having to put it in the yaml in a specific format especially the tags for me i just prefer you know tags colon colon then i can put my tags there and then dataview can recognize the inline metadata so i guess that would be my answer moving on what is the difference with the kindle obsidian plug-in that plug-in is free are you is your team aware of that uh no but i do think there's probably an opportunity for someone i'm going to do a comparison and compare kind of the pros and cons yeah i'm aware of it um again i haven't been consuming too much right now but it's pretty cool what haiti did there it doesn't have the functionality that is in this read-wise official i don't think i don't think it can auto-update without overwriting and kind of for me that's number one on the list but the fact that haiti produced that i was pretty impressed by so definitely a round of applause for for his work but um someone else could again give more details to the compare and contrast and that would be nice but overall i don't know if it does at this time do the auto updating without overwriting i think you have to delete and so it's just a process there but pretty cool that that was made next one we have about 12 more minutes if you change the name of the md file in obsidian or move its location okay we kind of covered that that's well any new highlights from rewi still be added to the but i think i think that question um if you move this document you know out of the folder read-wise the extension will not be able to find it so when you do another resync it will create another seven powers within here so unfortunately we haven't figured out a way for you to be able to rename the file or move it uh in terms of its um location on your computer and still work so everything kind of needs to stay where it is when it's exported from alfredo what is the reading app that will provide the best experience in connecting read-wise with obsidian i could become reading app agnostic in exchange for the smoothest experience uh it depends on what you're reading so you've got books which are a whole can of worms um you know heavily protected by drm you know so you need to use some sort of ebook reading app you've got the platforms kindle apple books and google play books far and away the best one is kindle just because they automatically sync to the cloud so that becomes a seamless experience you know i was reading last night in bed and reading this book by edward slingerland i don't know why formatted this way must've done something but then it will appear in uh obsidian in the morning if you're reading articles and web content you've got to read it later apps like instapaper and pocket and then you've also got the highlighting extensions such as the one that we were just messing around with here or hypothesis unfortunately it's the paper and pocket haven't really been updated in like the past half decade but they are pretty dependable um i much much prefer into paper to pocket because it lets you take notes and i believe that the best way to you know read between the lines is to write between the lines it you know perplexes me that pocket doesn't let you take annotations as you read but some people prefer pocket and then there's pdfs which are an incredibly frustrating file format but obviously a very important part of any knowledge workers workflow for that i prefer an ipad with pdf expert that's this particular app you have to be careful what app you use when reading and highlighting pdfs because some don't actually create highlights instead you're basically like drawing rectangles on top of the pdf and once you highlight a pdf you can email that file to read wise and then that'll parse and show up in here so three different types of content unfortunately it's a pretty unbundled space right now so you need to set up your tool stack the right way and then for podcasts people really like this app called air um where you can basically take highlights of podcasts the pdf okay i also actually use pdf expert good to hear that that's um i kind of just stumbled backwards into that one so i'm happy to hear from you that that's worth using now but you're saying the highlights you make can also be imported into um obsidian or what was that workflow i think i was looking at a comment um so you can highlight a pdf as provided you're using the right app um and provided that the pdf isn't coded the right way you know you're not just like looking at a scan you can read a pdf and highlight it and then that'll modify the pdf file and you can send that modified pdf file to read wise in a variety of different ways but the easiest way is just to email it to add readwise.io all the instructions are here or you can drag and drop it and then that pdf will parse out the highlights and then create a book or an article for you and then that book or article will be exported to obsidian while we're on the topic of pdf stan anders is asking he says i've read your faq about pdfs and all the challenges with them is pdf expert the best way to create highlights and annotations for parsing within read wise what are your thoughts on that um on ipad it definitely seems to be the most foolproof on desktop there's literally 200 different pdf readers so it's really up to kind of personal preference and experimentation my general advice is just find the app that suits you the best test it with read wise and see if it's creating real annotations for the pdf spec and go that way but my personal preference for whatever that's worth is pdf expert on ipad well i'm just going to plug in my laptop and that that sort of begs the question when when we talk about pdfs for the you know the hardcore academics and researchers they at least it makes me think of zotero and how that workflow might look if somebody's comfortable with zotero now obviously a reference manager you're getting a lot of that detail that you might need for citations but i'm someone asked carbon se asks here are zotero or paper pile in the road map for automatic importing into obsidian um that might sorry that might actually go outside of what the intentions of read-wise but yeah yeah i can't speak to whether or not those apps are working on their own plug-ins with obsidian or if they they have apis to enable someone in the community to pull them in i i don't really we cater to more of like a an auto didact than like the scholarly academic world um don't get me wrong there's some overlap there but we're not really experts on reference managers so i can't really speak to that okay um yeah that's a tough one i know there are some other tools and the good news is with obsidian's architecture you can use things like the plug-in md notes by argentina and some other things and get a good zotero workflow going on for those pdfs that's great here's here's a good one that i was kind of wondering myself also from david thoughts on using a web plug-in highlighter versus highlights in instapaper so for example let's this new exciting read-wise plug-in versus highlighting in instapaper really comes down to personal preference i've met people who supporters of the open web are pretty dogmatic like oh the author made the page a certain way now obviously this person is writing on sub stack so it's not like a whole lot of craft went into shaping how this looks but there are people who believe that it's like betraying the author somehow to pull the content off and read it in a in a different app so it really comes down to personal preference i personally prefer reading in a very consistent calm space you know that tries to remove distractions and just focuses on the actual reading experience that's my personal preference but i mean just like the way people use obsidian and you know some people want to use dashes for bullets other people want to use asterisks some people want block quotes i think i think this is in the same vein it really comes down to the person what their workflow is like what they're reading and you know their views towards the open web yeah good points there you bring up another one too about the the intention of how something should be read which is a whole nother like you know what is art how should be consumed makes me think of netflix they i think they added the feature half a year a year ago to watch content at 2x speed like up to 2x and you know if it's a feature film it's by christopher nolan i don't think there are any christopher nolan films on netflix but the point being is that's somebody who really wants to make sure that you experience his work in the theater and all that and so so that yeah the interesting side conversation that we won't go down that rabbit hole because eric asks a great question from a data protection standpoint is all the read wise data pass-through from example kindle to the end user or is it stored in read-wise read-wise's managed platform it's stored in read-wise the thing we didn't go into is kind of the core functionality of readwise which is this whole daily review so we really have two value props uh the one value prop that we focused on entirely during this conversation is kind of our zapier syncing value prop where we import from a variety of sources and then we export to a variety of destinations but the core functionality is this like daily review where it becomes this very beneficial habit that people find very easy to maintain in contrast to like zettle casting or slip boxing or whatever where you know it's kind of like a new year's resolution everyone rushes in like oh this is gonna be my year and change it you know and then after a month they stop like doing it this right here is like an easy daily habit like you can see i have a 193 day streak we have people who have been doing this every day without fail for three or four years straight like this is the core functionality of read wise and so we we need to store highlight data in order to support this yeah that's a good answer and um you know usually somehow you you did it with this feature like a lot of times there are good intentions that don't turn out well but the simplicity the kind of the joy of clicking to review the daily review but somehow it's like the perfect balance and it's a good example of how technology can help in the space repetition or the the learning process and re returning to things i think when i was younger all i wanted to do was watch the next movie and the next movie and this or that to kind of build up how many things i've watched but there comes a point when you kind of want to focus on and return to those movies or those books or those quotes that mean a lot to you and so you have that as a easy to develop habit and i think that's what it's about yeah i mean most people we find or in this space have taken like hundreds if not tens of thousands of highlights but they never go back and revisit them so we make it easy to consistently review your highlights in a way that is not guilt-inducing exactly yeah very good i have a few more q a questions i want to i'm not sure if we'll have time for them we're approaching the hour mark right now i think uh if people go to read wise dot io slash lyt they'll come through your link so typically we're a paid product with a 30 day free trial but if you come through this link you'll get double the free trial and if you already signed up during this uh but not through this link just email hello rebus.io and aaron and i will we'll fix that for you that's very nice of you to bring that one up daniel and uh yeah so full disclaimer here this is the it's kind of new to me but this is the first affiliate sort of thing i've done so i do get a kickback from this doesn't matter to me you use that link or not um i've just been fully transparent for me to do something like this it's very important that i actually use it and pay for it and i pay for it out of my own pocket and you know the the company or whoever is not paying me or giving me free access so it met all the criteria plus you know i love i love it and the team is fantastic so just want to be fully clear with everybody i don't care if you use the affiliate link or not but um for what it's worth i use it i love it i'm excited to see how it continues building and yeah so thanks for bringing that that up that link that's nice of you and yes nice of aaron to initially reach out so uh with that in mind let's do one more clappity clap raise hand clappity clap back and forth to thank you for your time and i saw a lot of people in the chat from the obsidian forums and all sorts of different places and it's kind of cool to see they've all converged here for this read wise chat it seems like it's kind of a broader group than some of the other calls that we've had which is quite interesting with that in mind let's do a few more questions let's see could the read-wise highlighter potentially replace instapaper or pocket or is it not meant to absolutely definitely and again i think it ties into what you're saying about it's up to you with your reading experience yeah i mean some people use pocket as more of like a bookmarking app than they do necessarily a reading app and if you're using it as a bookmarking app like to save a recipe or youtube video the highlighter won't replace that but if you're using it as a place to send content that you want to read and then highlight and annotate the highlighting extension can definitely replace that have you considered exporting each highlight to an individual file for more atomic note and there's that's a good question um obviously rome has a block-based architecture in contrast to obsidian which is more page-based um so within rome each bullet becomes a block that can be referenced later so it works nicely there and we know i didn't know this before this past week but i guess a roam clone called log sac works uh complements obsidian very nicely and then it has a local first architecture and can kind of pick up on these files so we're going to look into whether or not we can accommodate logstack even better or at least like users kind of using a combo of both apps notion we export everything to a notion database and right now we kind of create a page within the database and then put in each highlight now because it is a proper database we could potentially put each database or put each highlight as a row into the database and make it individually referenceable in obsidian it's it's not obvious to us yet how we would go and we would turn every single highlight into its own file i mean it is technically feasible but if i did it i would have 36 000 files in my vault so we just need to think through like all right what do you name that right like what do you name the file for this highlight is it just like the book name and then like dash one and then dash two and it just kind of indexes so there are a lot of product questions there that aren't obvious to us but if there's enough demand and people have like ideas and use cases as to how it can unlock value we can definitely do it we did chat with a fellow who was using some plugin where you can like create like a block reference idea looks like that at the end and was basically backing into block level addressability within obsidian but i'm not enough of an obsidian expert to um teach that workflow yeah i would i would heartily recommend to go against making each highlight an atomic note i know that might replicate some functionality in outliner apps but i think in the obsidian infrastructure i don't think it'll be helpful um and again your your main way to recall or retrieve information is likely going to be from looking let's imagine it's a book going to the book and then you have your list there so when you're trying to find something you that's the best way to go about it if they're all individual notes with their uh i mean it's a mess for a few reasons not to say it can't be done everyone has a different you know here are the disclaimers everyone has a different workflow need but i would hardly re heartily recommend not doing that but it's a good question how do you make the obsidian index visible okay that's more of an obsidian question just quickly answering it it's a folder on your computer so you just have to find that folder on your computer and that's one of the beauties of working in local plain text type of files it's just there anders asks it seems like you plan to add a ton of features over the coming months can you think of any do's and don'ts to be cautious of in the meantime if you want to make use of new features when they come out and not lose work already done in your obsidian vault with your imported highlights and notes yeah i mean the file if you intend to use a different file and folder naming scheme i wouldn't invest too much into each of these um otherwise you'd kind of have to laboriously uh go well i guess what you could do is you could edit these files and then once you come up with a new scheme use whatever the scheme is to like rename this so if you want it to be the book name dash author you could go in heavily link this thing up or do whatever it is you're going to do to this file and then just pull it aside when you run the extension like put it into a different directory then you'll find a new seven powers and you can just go and replace it i don't think people can get through there might be an aspiration to sit here and spend like 40 hours going through each of these but i don't think people can like get through and process their notes at that high of value so worst case you might have to manage like five or ten items um that's going to be the main change that could screw you up the mobile is going to be purely additive i don't think if there's anything else i think that's it okay a lot of people are asking about if the chat transcript itself will be saved um yeah it will be it i'm surprised that you're not allowed to just um click into the chat hit uh you know select all and then copy that but there will be a chat transcript how we share it i don't know there'll probably be a link to the eventual youtube video and then you can just download it from there so um that will probably be the plan okay we are getting close to the very end last open question carmen okay direct import into obsidian was a typo into read-wise so i guess zotero into read-wise integration is that and i think you you're probably not too focused on that again you're focused on the auto didact versus the we heard zotero i mean it i'm not sure where it sits in terms of like commercial to open source but i have heard from users that they're working when i think of zotero i think of its application a couple years ago where you're basically using it to [Music] carry a lot of metadata about your sources for some sort of academic purpose and then it generates like a bibliography or citations that you can then use to properly cite in your writing app be it like microsoft word or whatever um i have heard that zotero is moving into also being a pdf reader is that what's being asked like if you take highlights in zotero as a pdf reader because i think for the longest time it couldn't handle like any reading of its own and we can only integrate with apps where you can take highlights because that's how our atomic unit is a highlight the same way that you know obsidian's is a page so if you can't take a highlight in zotero there's really no way for us to interface with it but i do know that zotero has been working on a pdf reader but i didn't know if it was available yet yeah i don't know if it's still in beta or not i'm sure people on the call do know but that'll be interesting to see what develops along that flow because if you are taking zotero to make highlights then you just have a choice do you want to go directly to obsidian via a different workflow or in the future is there a way to you know connect it to read wise which will then go to obsidian with the same type of workflow as books and articles tweets and all the other interesting well i mean if they if they do the pdf reader and i do think they have a plug-in system um i think i think we probably will be able to support them in the future we don't currently do it that would be quite interesting i think because it's i i know like you said the main focus is on the self-learner but the academic and the researcher that might be kind of a nice entry point for them because you know and zotero being there absolutely main tool of choice i i could be wrong but zotero seems to be the main reference manager so connecting that to a unified workflow that's interesting it's definitely uh it's definitely what we're about yeah i think this is yeah us academics really love read wise too um okay so i think that's basically it we'll get everyone out um just a little over we've answered all the questions many questions 27 just in the q a and i know there were probably just as many in the chat so aaron you're really on top of that just flying around and there were a lot of questions everyone i think you did so are there any final words last thoughts it was fun it was really great to read all of your questions um if anyone slipped through the cracks if you guys have questions that come up after this you guys i'll pop this in the chat but you can email hello at readwise.io and either angie or myself well we'll get back to you pretty promptly um but yeah i hope this was helpful for everyone it's also for me to see how people are using the tool yeah at the end of the day we really we really do two things read-wise and that's build product and talk to our users so uh feel free to reach out with any questions or comment or feedback you have um i'm sure as you guys know through being in the obsidian community like some people can get very edge casey and it's hard for us to develop a whole feature for for one user but what we try to do is we try to receive all the feedback and synthesize it and then develop something that can serve as many people as possible in the best way possible yeah well i think the good news is here most everybody if you're if you're on this call you're probably patient and understandable that just because you have whatever random edge case you can't just snap your fingers and and the magic happens but uh i do i do feel quite good in trusting you know this part of the workflow to to the folks at read wise and that's that means that means a lot you know i prefer to use as few tools as possible and just make sure that they're reliable workflows i'm kind of past the stage where i just want to try a million different things i just want to kind of settle in hunkered down and start developing ideas compounding my value and you know that's where that's work it's pretty fun so yeah last round of applause thank you so much daniel and aaron um this was just fantastic i learned quite a bit just amazing so awesome thank you for having us yeah it was a delight next time bye everyone all right thank you everyone [Music] [Music] you
