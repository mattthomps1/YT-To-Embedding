danielle asks how can i use obsidian and 
note taking for college i'm gonna put this   here does it work oh thank you um yeah well i 
kind of wish i was a college student right now   so i could apply a lot of these methods but 
long story short daniel you want to do this   whatever subject you are studying it's been 
decided for you the best thing you can do   is to pre-develop some mocs like a skeleton of of 
ideas that you can then a skeleton of big concepts   and then as you're in the lecture you start 
to fill in these concepts you branch out into   other notes as you need to but you have your 
mlc pre-built and and that's sort of magic um   so hey we have 10 minutes left i'm 
going to try to answer as many as i can   and then hopefully the zoom session continues   if it continues that's good but let's just 
plan for 10 minutes and see where we go when creating multiple notes from a book do you 
make an mlc for the book yes so that answers the   same question as the previous one is that i'll 
make yeah mlc for the book and then with each   chapter with each section whatever i might you 
know write my own notes and then make new notes   outside based on that i mean there's not one way 
to do this by the way um so it might change it   just depends on your situation carl asks how 
much does the workshop cost i think i answered   that like two two two minutes after you asked 
the question so hopefully you're good there   what are your rules of thumb if you find a 
vault that has so much information that other   vaults may be needed to prevent file size issues 
brandon i guess i haven't um come across that yet   and i probably the main reason you say um file 
size issues well the beauty of markdown is that   files are small the the biggest part of the light 
kit are the images if you delete the images then   the file then then it's like less than a 
megabyte of size um but as far as uh issues   where you get beyond 10 000 notes you might have 
some slowdown in the apps that are out right now   that's only going to improve though with time 
and technology uh becoming faster so i'm less   concerned about that it has not impacted my 
personal library of around 5000 notes but   okay david a lot of notes you have seen quite 
broad do you follow the principle of atomicity   great question um yeah i i try to i look at it 
as uh so david i look at it as two different ways   there are evergreen notes that i'll try to 
make mostly atomic now my atomic might be   slightly different than your atomic let's see 
if i can pull up a good example of that for you okay here's my note on evergreen notes 
greatly inspired by andy matushak   and this is my take on it so here david this is 
an evergreen note that has a clear strong title   evergreen note making sharpens your thinking okay 
so we can click on that and then that's that note   now it links back to evergreen notes which is 
a secret moc a little different than most but   back to your question yeah so some some notes are 
broad and some are specific and the way i look at   that is if it is a concept i want it to be broad 
i kind of think of them as little stars in the sky   that i can then connect my specific opinionated 
ideas to these stars like anti-fragility that is   a concept that i did not come up with uh naseem 
tele came up with it um so i just kind of want to   honor that with my own commentary but then i can 
have an evergreen note that says something like   anti-fragility is a smart way of thinking it's a 
bad example but you see how that then becomes the   evergreen note that links to the concept which 
is more of this like pillar and so in that way   um my library of ideas isn't all atomic notes 
because i don't want that to be the case but i   want some to be opinionated and i want some to be 
um i shouldn't say that they i'll take that back   my library is a hybrid of evergreen 
notes with very clear statements   and then concept notes or manual notes right 
that are less opinionated but have information   that is important more like fact like and then 
opinion like that's kind of the two two extremes   are you familiar with christopher alexander's 
a pattern language it represents proto-pkm for   vernacular oh cool well i'm i'm familiar with 
the title and that's it so i'll throw that in   there do you have access to a markdown exporter 
i'm concerned about my links being future proof   um well see the beauty of those links i 
don't have access to an exporter and again   i think other people can answer that question 
better than i can because i'm not too concerned   with exporting importing right now but as to 
the pattern length of pattern language i've   heard about that book recently so it's 
probably something i'd like to read to   understand more and to stay up to date on on 
this field there's just so many other fields   that i'm hoping to get into part of the workshop 
is that you come into it with your project that   you want to work on and then six weeks later we 
hit that milestone hopefully that you had in mind   with your project point being is my 
capstone project for the fall workshop   is to explore cosmos the series by neil degrasse 
tyson and carl sagan and to to pull out those   ideas and make my maps of content based on that um 
so my my point is that not everything i'm doing is   around personal knowledge management like i don't 
i don't want to be just a guru of one tiny field   and only talk about that field i think 
the you know true practitioners of of good   pro personal knowledge management are not just 
talking about personal knowledge management they   should be talking about other domains right i 
mean because if that's all they're talking about   you kind of wonder like hmm are they just 
the guru or are they actually a practitioner   um and i i definitely do not want to 
just be the bad bad case of the term guru   do you only add mlcs to the home node 
patrick asks patrick uh the answer to   that is no and that's what we get into a lot in 
the workshop there are five levels of emergence   and and i don't have the graphic pulled up but 
there's a super graphic it's it's too much to   take in at any one time the point being is you 
have notes then you have your zettle costume which   are a bunch of notes linked to each other this 
is level two level three is where you pull those   some notes you gather them into a map of content 
and you start to form them but level four answers   your question which is where the maps link to each 
other so instead of notes linking to each other in   level two the maps are and then level five is 
the home note um yeah um do you use citations i do but i but for my purposes since i'm 
not you know creating academic work i'm less   rigorous with citations but it can be done 
and it would be you know the process is   very easy to accomplish uh through linking your 
thinking i.e tags okay so anthony had a couple   i think how to max use of tags i.e 
tags and links seem to do similar work   they do but tags like i've been trying to 
to articulate are weaker links they they   aren't like family links they are hey 
we're both interested in the same stuff   um we can talk more about that how do you use 
tags and breadcrumbs so david that's another one   that actually i'm glad you asked so the thing 
is this is my home note and i'm going to dive   into one of my top 10 or so home maps so i go to 
mindsets and then i'm going to and see here's that   breadcrumb i manually put in this i kept it as 
simple as possible it only goes one level up but   let me dive into concepts and see what happens 
to this now i'm in concepts now let me go to uda all right so once we get to the individual 
note i want the content to shine this is a   personal aesthetic you might be different i want 
the content to shine so then once we're in the   singular singular note level then i have the link 
at the bottom but once we get to a map of content   links go back to the top and let's show another 
example that mindsets here's a better one habits   so now i clicked into habits habits is below my 
mindset's home map so instead of linking to home i   just link to this map that's directly above it so 
and then and see check this out i don't even move   my mouse just click click i'm back home so that's 
kind of the beauty of breadcrumbs and and how   it works it kind of seems simple but there are a 
couple uh subtle nuances that really make it shine   do you have a daily routine for writing ever these 
evergreen notes or do you just write the notes   whenever you feel like it oyster sauce asks this 
question and and to answer that i don't have did   that get in there here let me type that again oh 
no it's just people are chatting so much okay um   i don't have a daily routine for these evergreen 
notes it's one of those things where there's a   day where i create five and then there's a day 
or a week where i create zero it just depends   when i do get into the mode of of creating new 
knowledge it usually is because i'm inspired by   something that i've read or encountered and i'll 
start to make some notes very quickly the way my   mind works is i'll make a temporary map of content 
and just start collecting those notes note links   in the map in the map of content and when i do 
that it really allows my thinking to come alive   i don't think i'm the only one that this can 
really change the game for so when i'm creating   something and i showed that in the the habits 
example hey just start assembling these ideas in   a space where that you can then take this link 
and move it above that link or then maybe you   take these two links and you put them down here 
because they're kind of just related to themselves   only and then you start shaping them and that 
and that's the real magic of the map of content okay you
