[Music] let me just start here with the bookworm section so i have a note in here for every episode of the podcast that we've done and these notes look something like this i'll go into edit mode so you can see everything that's in here so i have this yaml metadata at the top which just tags it with bookworm but then also has joe's rating for the book and my rating for the book and these are separate and they're based on like the amazon sort of five star ratings i use dataview to pull all of those into a lists and i have it sorted based on like my uh the descending order based on my rating so that way if someone asked me like hey what are some of the best books that you've read i can go to obsidian just look at the list of episodes and grab the books that way i love it okay we're putting a pin in that i'd like to maybe okay so then i've got a link to the actual book page who it's by who picked the book when we published it i grabbed the mp3 file from libsyn so i can actually play the episode inline if i if i wanted to and then uh from the bookworm website when we publish it i just grab all the links and paste those in here as well the book itself let's take a look at liminal thinking here all right um so i have a format for this where again yaml metadata at the top book notes and bookworm and then i've got some info on the book who it was by when we covered it i do have the mind map i'll come back to three cent summary here in a second here's the mind map i use mind node and in my node you can actually i'm not sure if they still offer this service but they did a while back maybe grandfathered it out but they have this my mind node service where you can publish it to the web so this is an iframe the other alternative to this would just be to export it as a pdf and drop that in i've done that in the past as well but i do like these uh these iframes so this allows me to zoom in zoom out and i can basically like navigate through this like i would um here is the uh the luminal thinking chart that i was telling you about you know reality the unknowable your experience is based on top of that your attention that's really what you're able to focus on just a random step from this that stuck with me we can we can take in 11 million bits of information per second but the amount of information we can focus on is like 50 bits it's like a crazy small percentage so that's basically what everything else is built off of your theories your judgments your beliefs and then at the top is the the bubble of belief and kind of how you change that is you you test things and you embrace the the learning loop he explains that a little bit down here you know your needs your beliefs drive your actions drive your results you get feedback and then you just kind of rinse and repeat so uh this is what the mind node file looks like and this is the the basis here so then i publish this as an iframe another thing you can do with my node is you can export as a markdown file so i export as markdown and then i just copy paste that markdown throw notes on the top of it and then the rest of this is just straight out of mind node so it's all broken down by the different level headers and it's got the different sections here and uh i'll add links to pages here where i want to extend the the conversation about a particular topic so like this limiting beliefs you know so i have a link to limiting beliefs and i have a basic definition of this but this is going to pop up other places and by creating its own page i can now link to this from the other books where this would mention or would that would that would be mentioned i do have action items from reading these books i share these on the podcast too but i use the task formatting for these so i can find all my incompleted tasks and it's basically the only sorts of tasks i track in here at the moment but i got to follow up on them before you know we record next bubble belief so this is just an example of like the notes there's a lot here i have my own emoji system which i've been doing for a long time you could use tags for this as well but i find this helpful when i'm looking at the notes visually so the quote bubble these are our quotes and actually i would also tag this with hashtag quote so i can bring that into my quote book later the key is a key idea the light bulb is just kind of like an inspiration point every once in a while something will just completely blow my mind i'll have a mind-blown emoji if there's something i want to add to the outline for bookworm i'll have like a talking head icon but yeah so this is kind of what they look like everything is foldable because i have those settings turned on i like the light bulb one side i actually tangent not to derail you too much but have you i'm curious have you come across this one uh no theater of war i can't tell who it's by but uh brian i'm going to not be able to pronounce his last name doris it's it's pretty great uh we'll get back to this is like a 30-second tangent but it's essentially what ancient greek tragedies can teach us and it delves deeply into um yeah it delves deeply into something like ptsd but there's another name for it maybe um that i think ties into our beliefs and kind of this moral ambiguity that that comes up but the reason i brought it up is because i was just looking at it today and there's this quote in there tragedy was not simply a matter of entertainment it was an ancient technology like this big punch i was like whoa so that's where i like that idea of using like a light bulb it's like i don't know where i'm going with this but it needs to be it's a light bulb moment yep yeah i like that uh side note to your side note uh i always when someone mentions a book i jot it down and if i can i immediately buy it uh really yeah i i have this bookshelf behind me which is full of books and most of them i have read but i think that there is value even in collecting books that you haven't read all the way through yeah and and lore talks about this with she calls it the anti-library i believe and i don't take it that far like i do intend to read every book that i i buy uh every once in a while i'll finish a book for bookworm you know i'll have like some time and i'll i'll do a gap book in between and uh i've done less of those lately than i would have than i like but a lot of those books that someone just mentions and i i buy and they're sitting on on my bookshelf somewhere sitting on my nightstand you know those are the ones that i'll pick up as a a gap book and uh some of the best insights i've gotten have been from from those it's a it's a really i mean even though it's like 20 bucks a book whatever because by the hardcover physical ones i consider that one of the best investments i can make i think there's a lot to that and speaking of the bookshelf if you are far enough away from the bookshelf and you look at it like bookshelves have been around forever as long as there have been books it is a map yeah these things are next to each other and you've put them there for a reason you can kind of recall one book because of its placement to another book or if you're looking at one book it thoughts come into your mind think you look at the book right next to it and those start to kind of talk to each other in strange ways yes that gets into how to read a book we're gonna have to talk about that for sure um one second on that though before we get there the three cent summary so i've kind of shared like a drop in the mind map i drop in the notes uh just to close this loop this is the last thing i'll do when i create a new book note is i will force myself to summarize everything that is below so i'm reviewing my notes when i'm putting them in here i'm adding the links creating new pages where it makes sense and then i'm summarizing all of that into three sentences and that uh that's difficult sometimes like picking the things that you're gonna include in the summary and which ones you're gonna gonna neglect but that just reinforces the whole signal versus noise idea right and what stands out to me from these books that i read i have enough that i'm going going to try out the three cents and sentence summary a bit more i love the constraint it's like you have these constraints just to like okay i'm up for it yep i'm up for the challenge totally so how to read a book by mortimer adler this is a phenomenal classic book uh neither joe nor i liked it when we read it um but it's uh it stuck with me um and this one he talks about let me go back in edit mode here there are a couple here we go levels of reading and this is the point where i really felt enabled not to try and recreate everything that i was reading so elementary level is where you're asking what does the sentence say inspectional reading is where you're asking what is the book about analytical reading is where you're asking many organized questions and then centopical reading is when you're placing these books in relation with one another okay so in this book mortimer adler basically says when you're reading a book you're having a conversation with the author and in a conversation you are free to disagree with the other person i had never really thought about it that way i was like read the bios and like this person is really successful i haven't done anything i guess i'd better just shut up and listen to them right yeah but exactly but uh i felt overwhelmed by the amount of information that i was not applying in my life than when i kept reading these books so like that's not sustainable and like well there's got to be a better way it was actually when i read steel like an artist by austin cleon that that's where this started because that was tangentially related to my belief that i was not creative uh because i play music and i like to write songs you know i would write a song and then i would realize that i stole the chord progression from this other song and when i heard it on the radio i'd get frustrated be like oh man i just can't create i don't have that gene i can't make up anything completely original and when i read steel like an artist by austin cleon he basically said that when you create something you're really just connecting dots there's the connection to the graph view in ways that haven't been done before so the dots themselves are not original and at that point i was like aha creativity is a formula i just need to connect or collect better dots and then my brain will connect them whatever comes out is the natural output of this equation and i don't to judge it anymore it just is what it is the only way to influence this is to just figure out how to collect some some better dots so that really you said that really well i just want to take a moment to kind of you know remind myself to watch this point because that's so well said you know somewhere in society someone where we're brought up it's the idea of the creative you know genius who like comes up from scratch these ideas and um that's harming more people than i realized i think you know being in the pkm community i was like oh my gosh like it's hard this idea that oh i'm not creative or whatever and therefore i shouldn't be doing things it's it's getting in a lot of people's way more than i truly realized and what you said is is i think the best way to overcome that so definitely thanks for articulating it so effectively yeah i actually today as we record this we're releasing our obsidian course over at the sweet setup and i have a section in there on just like general pkm stuff and there is one video in particular i created the title is you are creative and it's kind of trying to bust this myth that oh i'm not creative i see all these other people who are creating awesome stuff but that's just that's just not for me uh somebody told a story one time that when you're a little kid and you give it you give a little kid a box of crayons they're not sitting there wondering like well what are these for they just start drawing and over time they share their work and maybe they don't get the response that they were hoping for and so they just decide not to try anymore and really creativity is getting the guts to ask for your crayons back [Laughter] i love it yeah i love that yeah so uh that idea from austin cleon and connecting the dots when i first stumbled onto initially it was rome research and then obsidian i was like oh so this is basically a representation of what is in my brain and i was immediately drawn to that because for the first time i now had the potential you know getting back to like the map is not the territory i'm the cartographer i have to create these dots and connect them strategically so they're actually providing me the value that i think they they have but it was a visual representation of what was actually inside of my head yeah that's that's quite amazing okay so mike i think we're probably let's go for about nine more minutes or so and then we'll okay see if anyone has some questions for you i'm sure they do sure so do you mind if i jump into the sketch notes stuff real quick because i think that's where the graph stuff makes the most it provides the most value for me so i was taking notes i've always been a little bit of a a tech nerd um my dad owned a software company i grew up with like an apple tui in the in the living room you know banging on it since i was two years old and uh brown 2017 as you can see here on the left i decided that i was not getting as much from my notes as i wanted to taking them digitally so i started doing sketch notes and actually 2017 this is the point where i started doing them on the ipad using the apple pencil because when you physically write out your notes you don't you can't capture word for word what's being said you have to synthesize this being said and basically get the gist of it and what's important well sketch notes is like that to the nth degree so what i do when i take notes is let's just look at this one all right i will tag these and then i will actually draw this image live in the sermon or if i'm attending a conference talk whatever using good notes on my ipad then i'll export that as an image i'll drop it in here and i have these uh nomenclatures so like the boxes around the verses right those are verses that in this case my pastor is mentioning while he is preaching this sermon and then i transclude those underneath the scripture references these are all broken down by headers but these are all individual verses this was my biggest pain point coming into obsidian because in rome you just have all these things on a page you can use block references block references and obsidian pale in comparison to roman research but that's part of the the deal when you have everything as its own individual text file so i was trying to figure out how to solve that problem i eventually landed on something i don't know if it's original but i came up with this idea of atomic note taking from atomic habits by james clear atomic meaning like the tiniest little pieces right so i have all these verses i was like what if i just blew this all up and everything was its own individual verse so that's what i did and what that does i have all those in a separate bible folder a separate chapter or book folders subfolders separate chapter subfolders and then i have this local graph now and this is what i love about this local graph is i have the sermon notes from this day right here and you can apply this you know other ways if you want but this is the one for me i'm the faith-based productivity guy right so i can click on galatians 5 22. it takes me to galatians 5 22 and i have all of the other sermon notes that have also referenced galatians 5 22. so i can pull all of those sermon notes up side by side i get bigger context now i get those pictures which already those have kind of stuck with me because i took the time to draw the pictures in the first place it's kind of amazing to me like before i started doing this if you were to ask me what'd your pastor preach about last week i wouldn't have been able to tell you but i remember these visuals that i created from months ago just because i had to figure out how to how to do it so i really love this you know i'll go in here and i'll open all these things up occasionally i'll have to i have a bible college degree so i and i'm an elder at my church so occasionally i'll be called upon to to preach and this is always like the first step that i do is like i'll go back okay what did my pastor just preach on and then i'll kind of study out those themes i've got some bible software where i can dig into like the original greek and hebrew meanings and stuff too but i don't do that as often as i i really uh thought i would uh really the the stuff is like the inspiration from the connecting of the dots like oh this connects over here i never thought of it from that perspective before and so it helps me see things through a new lens yeah absolutely i think there's a lot there's a lot to take from here um taking this this is this big work one of the big works in the world the bible and you know i was thinking like back in college i actually had just graduated and i wanted it was around that time i wanted to stretch myself and i did something i never thought i would ever do but i auditioned to like be a part of the college theater and eventually that like three plays later that led to being a part of a hamlet and hamlet is like one of those where any shakespearean work where you every line like the bible is up for interpretation is up for what is really being said here like what is and i find those work so interesting and you know what you're showing here mike is a really good way to to dive into and analyze um these these works and remember them make those connections connecting the dots um this is uh yeah i yeah i'm just excited about this cool two other topics before questions hopefully your personal retreats i know you do something special and then managing writing projects with kanban so i'm not sure maybe we can cover one of those for now and then we'll see what happens later man time is flying by so i have this personal retreat framework i actually have a course for this on my personal site faithbaseproductivity.com this was something that i landed on where i would go away for an entire day and just think about what happened the last quarter and set some some goals for the next quarter identify the habits that i wanted to establish stuff like that so i've been doing this for a while again good notes i have like a whole pdf workbook that i just load in there but i started doing that in obsidian and i did the last one here in obsidian uh let's see here's my personal retreats so here's my personal retreat from quarter 2 20 21 i start by listing my core values making sure that these have not changed and then i have this wheel of life exercise where i rate myself in my different areas from 0 to 10 or 1 to 10. and i've always like colored this out from the middle and it kind of gives you a visual representation of how things are going the idea here is that you take the lowest areas and you build your goals around that okay so i've been trying for months to figure out how can i recreate this inside of obsidian and just the other day i had the realization that i could use a radar chart so i'm using the charts view plugin and this is what it looks like and i absolutely love this so it's just like a little spider web type graph you know based on this fun and recreation is the area i want to address i have the ratings here and then kind of some insights here for i won't spend a whole lot of time here but one of the things that really makes this click and i've applied this to just about every area of my life my wife and i ask these questions when we do our date nights is these three things right here what should i start doing stop doing and keep doing ask these questions and then give yourself a bunch of time to let your brain unravel them and figure them out uh it's really easy for my personality to just try to add one more thing add one more thing so start doing that's pretty easy i can usually find a big list of things that i want to do but i force myself every single time i do one of these personal retreats to find one thing to stop doing and that creates space and margin to take advantage of some other cool opportunities and then at the end you know the different goals that i'm going to set from from this so this is i mean nothing technically uh impressive about this other than the chart view but it's just a place in this list i find like taking these notes uh the day of inside of obsidian is is really fun i look forward to it yeah uh so charts view and so what is that plugin called is it called charts view it's called charts view yep so there's obsidian charts and that has a radar view as well this one just looks better so i like this one i will have to experiment with this um and yeah this is this is great and it's pretty straightforward too i mean once you plug in that information once you have a template and then it's easy to repeat yes yes exactly all right so the articles thing um i have all my articles that i'm writing up here in the articles folder but i track all these in an article's kanban note which looks like this so it's just using the kanban plugin and there's links to each one of these it's just double little brackets i make sure every item has a has a a pre-existing note attached to it and then you can set the metadata that you want to show up here so i have different kinds of articles that i'm working on this is like a mindset article this is just a cool app that i found for tss suite setup another mindset want a mindfulness monday interview sort of a thing so nick's just appeared on the website yesterday and uh got some great feedback on that so thank you for doing that nick the ones that are are active i usually will put a due date so that's kind of like uh the way we manage our tasks we do it in notion as a team so i do all my writing in obsidian though i add a couple plugins focus mode plugin better word count uh stuff like that and then i do all the writing here so this will take me to the the article itself i haven't really done a whole lot with this yet but i just started this and then the the date is linked to the the daily note that's a week before it would actually publish so that's the date that i have to be done writing it and start transferring everything up to wordpress editor can look at it etc and i love this plugin because you can just drag these between the different different columns which kind of blows my mind when i think about about that sort of functionality i hope more plugins add that sort of thing you know where it's not just a view but it's actually you can interact with it inside of the preview mode it does blow my mind too like this is these are plain text files yep that that you're just dragging and dropping and somehow you know all the magic works yeah um that's that's the the advantages of building on the bedrock yeah this is you know this is stable it's earthquake happens your you know your your building notes are not going to collapse this is a well-designed earthquake proof plaintext structure can i give you one more workflow do we have time for one more workflow yeah yeah i'm happy to hang out later if you're able to do that but this is my favorite one i have an interesting way of journaling i use daily notes yeah i use what are called daily questions the concept i picked up in triggers by marshall goldsmith and this is instead of asking yourself a prompt like what did i accomplish today you know and then you feel bad because you have nothing to put in there you just rate yourself based on your effort okay so did i do my best to and then you fill in your own questions so mine are grow spiritually love my wife love my kids be a good friend learn something create something and exercise i'll put in a score here from 1 to 10. these are all tagged so daily questions slash spiritual daily questions slash wife etc so that applies both the daily questions tag if i wanted to just see my daily questions and then also the individual responses for the individual tags same thing here with the journal entries and gratitude entries i'll fill these in if i have something if there's a significant event like i'll probably create a journal entry when we're done recording here but i don't do this every single day i try to at least do gratitude every single day the daily questions every single day i one of the sticking points for this was filling this in on my iphone at the end of the day if i didn't fill it in you know as i go i try to do that as i go throughout my day i'll go for a long run and i'll update the exercise one but having the ability to open to today's daily note and obsidian on my iphone makes it easy for me to just fill in these values then i have these values okay that's great what do i do with this information right and that's where the tracker plug-in comes in and this is part of the personal retreat process as well is i'll review my journal entries so i have a note here for daily questions and it's broken down by the different sections and it's the tracker tag it's going to show a line chart and it's going to go from 0 to ten it's gonna and it's gonna only i set the date here to only go from the last uh last period so last quarter so this is starting in in july when i render this it looks like this and this helps me see the trends and it helps me identify like if there was a really bad day like i will go click on that uh that day and i will figure out what are my journal entries like what contributed to that that low score and how do i avoid that day sorry what's that you you were a bad friend that day yep yep um so yeah like this helps me identify uh the contributing factors to the wheel of life stuff and then asking myself why like how do i create a process or a system which will fix this so looking at the um at the code to make this one work um the tracker code and then so the only thing that you kind of have to manage here is the start date so like after a while does it just keep going so if you didn't touch these and you look at them a year from now they just they would show you a lot of information they would just keep going and depending on what device you're accessing it from it may take a little while to render gotcha well that's kind of a nice functionality though so even if you don't update it it doesn't necessarily break all the data points are still there you can slice it any way you want but it's all there i like this so that's is that just called tracker or does it have a different name yep it's just called tracker and there's probably a couple settings in there it's it's one of those plugins like uh kanban where they they've improved it faster than i can keep up with it this was uh good enough for me so what this is doing is this is looking at the tags you can do it different ways you can search a specific folder you know if you wanted to do it that way and probably pull in like yaml metadata like i do for the bookworm ratings and then the search target this is so the tag that it's looking for in this case daily questions slash exercise and then the start date and then these are all settings pertaining to the line itself so the rating um basically what's going to appear on the graph if i you know see right here on the y graph you know the rating and then a minimum and maximum value and there's different types of charts that you can use with this as well there's probably a little bit of overlap and functionality between this and charts view but this was available when i was trying to solve that problem with my daily questions and so i just kind of stuck with it okay well this is pretty fun so we didn't even do an introduction which was kind of um intentional just be a more casual chat with this um the idea is just mike and i are chatting with each other and trying to ignore all the people in the audience um yeah so anyways but now we're going to transition into that okay a list of all the plugins that i use uh maybe it's easier for me to just screen share this part real quick because to be honest i don't even know everything that i i use uh i've been playing with a lot of different plugins so i'm just going to go all right auto backups uh i had 500 gigs worth of backups in my dropbox folder so that one's no longer there um better word count i like this because you can select a portion of the text and it gives you the characters and word count you can also do something kind of like the writing goals in ulysses where it can show the words that you've written for the day i don't particularly use that specific feature because that's not really important to me but i know a lot of people you need to have something like a thousand words a day or whatever um that's a cool way to do it the calendar view if you're gonna use daily notes and you should you need to have the calendar uh plugin enabled charts view that's the one that is currently only being used for my personal retreat stuff dataview is incredible i'm only scratching the surface with this but i use it for creating that table like i said for the bookworm ratings enhancing mind map i actually don't use this a whole lot i was playing around with this but this is cool because this creates a draggable mind map out of your out of your markdown file so kind of like kanban you know you can switch into the kanban view or you can go to the markdown view same thing with enhancing mind map except you can drag the nodes around in the preview mode so to speak focus mode i like this too i have that turned on footnote shortcut i like creating footnotes and the articles that i write and publishing those to the blog that way although i forget to do that more often than i should hotkeys plus plus love me some hotkeys kanban the mac os keyboard navigation minimal theme settings i use the minimal theme this just allows you to like change the color and stuff like that uh natural language states i think that's required for the review plug-in which adds you know you want to look at this note again kind of like space repetition sort of a thing adds it to a specific daily note note refactor i had this turned on but i actually don't use this a whole lot anymore note composer is enough for me most of the time i don't it has a lot of like automation stuff you can split everything apart by like third level headers or whatever but i don't use a whole lot of that i like the outliner i like being able to use the keyboard shortcuts to move things around uh reading time this is another thing i missed from ulysses where how long how long is it going to take to to read this this article so i have that toggled on the review plugin i mentioned i played around with the sliding panes doesn't really stick for me um todoist i actually don't use this one anymore i was playing around with task management though and i love that you can just embed a todoist web filter inside of a page uh tracker mentioned and then vantage i don't use this a ton either but i like the visual query building that you can do with that so those are my plugins although they will probably be different tomorrow okay i see you're using both folders and a big set of flat files what logic guided the structure that you set up uh good question mark and to be honest i feel like this is still kind of in flux i use a combination of folders and tags to find things and uh primarily folders uh the tags i i like the ability to use email metadata to apply those at a whole document level so i i do do a lot of that it's kind of built into the templates for like the sermon sketch notes and the book notes and things like that those are kind of like just in case tags but i try not to overuse my tags a whole lot uh in the because the file explorer is almost always open for me in obsidian i try to just have i see like common groupings of things i'll create a folder that's basically the gist of it so when i have a whole bunch of uh sermon notes and i'm like oh i think i should put those together i'll first put them in the sermon notes folder and then when i get too many in there i break them down by year and month and things like that so i just kind of how it how it makes sense uh to my brain visually but it's really not that big a deal because i use double brackets to link to the things that are really important i really rely on like the local graph when i'm looking at a note to see the the connections between different things so i don't think there's a wrong way to do the folders uh let's see have you read a book since you instituted the practice of a three cent summary would i write another three cents summary uh good question i don't think i have rewrote a book that i've added a three cent summary i do reread books um specifically books that have been very impactful to me like essentialism by greg mckeown is one that i will go back and and reread from time to time i've reread gtd several times although the more i read that now the more i i nitpick you know little holes in the system and i've kind of evolved it to meet my own needs and so i probably would not go back and reread that at this point i think if i were to reread a book that i had a three cent summary for i would just update the summary if needed but i i wouldn't necessarily feel compelled to to make a change there when you process notes into obsidian daily weekly when you start to update your notes in obsidian uh i'm in obsidian pretty much all day every day uh i kind of write for a living uh the the the notes for the podcast that i do the scripts for the videos like they're all in obsidian so i don't have like a set interval for when i do those sorts of things i'm just kind of always playing with it um i know you're gonna have david sparks on here nick and i he shared something with me though that i think is a good tip for people is he's like built into his daily routine half hour to play with his his uh life os thing i think he calls it like sparky os where he's just going in there and he's playing with stuff and i think play is a whole other topic probably talk another hour on that just like this is the real value from these things is when you know strong convictions lightly held right i have this idea but i'm not going to latch onto it as like oh this is the best idea i have ever had i give myself permission to play with it and if i get bored with it i'm not going to play with it anymore and that's that because i'm collecting better dots you know i'm not scared that like oh i'm not going to have another good idea to replace that hopefully that answers the the question but yeah i just i'm in here all the time and playing with the things that appeal to me uh let's see single vault for both personal research professional notes this correct can you discuss the pros cons for one versus several yeah there's definitely some cons with this i'm not a professional i guess so it doesn't really matter but if i was a lawyer or a doctor and had a bunch of sensitive information i would definitely keep that in a separate fault for me though i like the ability even if i don't make the connections to connect all of the things there so i think one of the the things i've made a mistake with in the past is i have like my bible sermon notes over here and i have my book notes over here and kind of when i was starting the whole faith-based productivity thing was like there's a lot of overlap here i was teaching a personal management class at our bible college and i was like all this stuff that the new york times bestsellers are writing about like these are based off of biblical principles and so i was kind of connecting those dots already those would be two vaults i think where people would naturally draw the distinctions but i actually find value in having them together now this is this is really great mike and especially with you just hopping in um this is our second lighthouse session but it's still so much of a an unknown thing and this was quite different from the first one so you know we're feeling this out and experimenting and you just you know lean forward into it so i really appreciate you for that mike you do have a course coming out on obsidian yeah it's like not good today or something yeah it's coming out coming out today uh if you want more information on it it's the sweet setup dot com slash obsidian it's called tube city and beyond it's 46 different videos there's some talking head videos which is just like basic elements of pkm i mentioned the you are creative video that's where that comes from some basic like i'm new to obsidian stuff more advanced stuff on specific ways to use some of the plugins some workflow stuff included in that is a video replay of the xero tube city and workshop that i did a couple times now uh yeah and then there's like all the suite setup courses it's worth bringing up now for people who are interested in it because there is a launch discount so it's 99 i think right now and it'll probably be 149 after launch week that's really awesome uh so take advantage of that you you get if it if mike is new to you you have a sense of his voice and um how varied his interests are and his use cases and i'm sure there's a lot of great value from that i think it's funny just side note before we get back to the q a is that um it's like we've had a master plan to perfectly time out all of these things like you know i had the uh you asked me to do those questions and i finally delivered them to you we had this set up you have a course launch but it's just all i mean i know you're more organized than me but i'm just kind of you know in triage mode taking care of this and that and like oh here are your questions and oh can you come on this and you're like yeah sure i can do that um but it it may look like there's a lot of coordination but i'm really just kind of surprised at the coincidental timing of everything yeah stuff just kind of clicks into place uh it started with me reaching out to you because i love your perspective on all of the sense making note making uh mocs all that kind of stuff pkm and uh asked you to do the mindfulness monday interview over at the the suite setup because i feel like you're kind of the perfect person for it so um but yeah i'm happy to to do this uh i mentioned to nick i was terrified of coming on here because i do feel like i am not an expert i feel very much like an obsidian poser [Laughter] like uh and i guess you know it's um the trick is to find specific ways that this clicks for you right and so i've done that and i'm getting a ton of value from it but i'm always in the back of my mind there's a voice it's like no one else is going to find this interesting but then you remember everything you told us from this conversation yeah you just have to put stuff together connect the dots and you know it's inherently valuable and what i've found in today's day and age being connected worldwide is that it's definitely valuable for a lot of people out there cool okay back to the questions for about nine more minutes sure i like mike's point about creativity involved in engaging in dialogue with text from others how does he keep note making from becoming a mere mashup of captured texts i have to credit nick milo for this because one of the big things i got from the linking your thinking workshop was the opinion notes i was definitely headed down this this path joel and uh what i forced myself to do was articulate you know if i had something that i didn't like why i didn't like it or if i had something that really spoke to me why that really spoke to me kind of the the one i use as an example in the course a lot is the moc that i created for habits because with habits there's the standard charles duhigg model the three points you know q routine reward and i've never really liked that and i never really realized why until i started bringing in all the things that i captured around habits and realized james clear has four steps he has in addition to the queue he calls it a craving and that craving basically you have a option to give in to the temptation or not so that i'm like aha that's what really bothers me is with the charles duhigg model this is just on autopilot and i am a rat in a cage and there's nothing i can do about it as soon as the cue shows up i have to follow through with the activity and i never really liked that so i interjected my own opinion note there and and i've i'm finding that as i force myself to write it out on my clicky keyboard uh the the thoughts become clear it's kind of magical and that's i'm doing a very poor job of explaining this but forcing yourself to sit down and actually articulate it's kind of like that three sentence summary if you if i were to ask if you were to ask me well what's this book about i kind of know but i can't say it succinctly until i have forced myself to come up with that three sentence summary and at that point i'm much i'm able to communicate it more effectively to somebody else you know just just to dive in on that mike is somehow your interpretation of um dew higgs book and and mine were exactly the same because i think he even hints at it but he doesn't he keeps it three steps it's like the publisher in him um was like you got to keep it to three but there was a fourth one there and and i think we both you know graded on that and then when james claire's a book came out he articulated that yes there this there's this fourth part to it so i just want to say how interesting that you had that same same thought on it yeah and james clear credits bj fogg at the beginning of his book on atomic habits for doing all this research and he's got a phenomenal book called tiny habits where he's got different uh sort of views and graphs that go along with his beliefs and so bringing all those things into one single note especially like those those images which are all captured in my book notes for those books and seeing how those things tie together provides a a lot of insight and then the trick is with that insight to do something with it we didn't really talk about this but i think nick you have a similar belief that i do that there has to be some sort of output when it comes to a pkm like if you just take things in all of the time you get all of the you feel the stress i think you call it like a mental squeeze point right where it's like there's so much information on this topic what do i even think about this so you force yourself to like gather all the pieces put them on the workbench and see how they they fit together i like to describe it as like little mental lego blocks and you're clicking these things together and you're able you're able to build you know whatever whatever you want out of it but having the the pieces when you need them is important yeah absolutely cool is there a book talking about making sketch notes that i learned through the app uh that i mentioned i learned um through trial and error but there is a really good book for this mike rohde is the kind of the sketchnote guy he happens to live in wisconsin and i have met him so uh he's a really cool guy but he wrote the sketchnote handbook and uh lots of good stuff in there basic idea that really hit with me is that you're capturing ideas not art so you don't have to judge your work um i wrote about this for the sweet setup a while back my sketchnoting journey and uh i share my first sketch note in that article it's basically a stick figure and a bunch of words [Laughter] so that's where i started you've seen where i ended up basically if i can do it anybody can do it it just takes takes practice uh can i demo how i make those amazing drawings real time on my ipad i really can't do that in real time but i do use use good notes and i like doing them digitally because there's no pressure now if i mess something up i can always just hit the undo button there's a balance there too though i did start with physical pens first and that was probably a good thing because it forced me to just keep going and not be judging the the drawing that i was making but i do find that when it comes to like more complex ideas that i get i'm not afraid to try those things on the the ipad because i can just um i i can just hit the undo button and try again if i want to also they have in the newer versions of ios you can just kind of like draw a circle and then you keep your pencil on on the page and then it will auto snap to like a perfect circle or a perfect square so i'll use those for like the boxes around the the um the verses i try not to use it for the sketches themselves a whole lot because i think it just looks kind of weird there's something charming to me whimsical about the the non-perfect lines um but if you really didn't want it to be you know perfectly square it's easy to do that without slowing you down uh where did i get my copy of the bible pre-divided into one verse per file i had a friend who understands scripting make it for me joe bulig but there's actually a forum thread in the obsidian forum called bible study and obsidian where he shared that script and i use the king james version so it's all um royalty-free but uh there are other people who are doing it with like other versions if there's something else that you you wanted to do i believe you can just download that one though from the obsidian forum uh the ideas that are found in many books that's one of the reasons i start calling things out as their own individual pages like occam's razer for example is a note that i have that one pops up in just about every productivity book you read the simple solution is the the best solution book summary services i do not use i kind of feel like they're cheating it's like going to the gym and you're going to work out but you don't put any weight on the bar that's just my own personal preference i don't think there isn't necessarily anything bad with them if you want to understand the gist of the book without reading the actual book go ahead and sign up for blinkist or something like that but i think the problem is when um people will read a blinkist review and then oh i read the book no you had a conversation with somebody who read the book but you didn't have a conversation with the actual author so there's a lot that you're you're missing there just to hop in on your metaphor it's almost like you're going to the gym and you're watching somebody else work out yeah i mean it's more value than that but um but it's maybe closer to that yeah yeah i got really offended one time with somebody who i've been trying to get to read books for a very long time is like hey this person is making me read this book uh what do you think of the blinkist summary of this and i'm like get that out of here you reread the book [Laughter] nice uh somebody had asked about obsidian versus ulysses because i had done the the core set the sweet setup for ulysses ulysses is a is a really really good writing app there are always been a couple things about it that have bugged me one is the non-standard markdown that was the thing that bugged me about rome research too it doesn't have standard markdown so i've kind of always been looking for a replacement for ulysses for myself and i've been able to make obsidian be that for me however if you're just looking for a writing app ulysses is amazing especially with it being part of set app i can't recommend setup enough it's a 10 a month service that gives you access to a whole bunch of really killer mac and ios apps my note is part of said app ulysses is on there and then like 200 other really great apps it's kind of like netflix for quality mac apps top three book recommendations this is hard and i think it would be different if i had a conversation with individual people too but i will say the book that i recommend more than any other recently and probably is the one that is most appropriate for this audience would be the great mental models volume one by rihanna bobbin and shane parrish it's a really well put together book it's very visual and they describe it as a latticework yep farnum street exactly a lattice work of mental models that you can use and it's kind of presented that way like here's some some models that you can use to look at the world through but it's up to you to choose which one to use in which situation you kind of have to do that through trial and error second one i would recommend i mentioned it already so maybe this is cheating but liminal thinking by dave gray i really did love that book and i feel like that one and the great mental models actually go very well together liminal thinking just encourages you gives you the kick in the pants that you need to look at things from other other perspectives i feel like the world that we live in right now is very politicized and doesn't matter what side of the aisle you find yourself on it's easy to surround yourself with people who are going to villainize the other side and just reinforce really limiting beliefs that you have based on your limited experience of of reality so i find it a a good reminder to now you need to include everybody in this conversation if you really are gonna attempt to know the truth about what's what's going on the third one i'm gonna say man search for meeting by victor frankl just because i feel this is one of those books that everybody should read at some point in their life viktor frankl is kind of known as the attitude guy and this is kind of his memoir of his experiences uh being in the concentration camps and uh in the very just to give you an idea of the quality of this guy in the introduction he talks about how he actually had obtained a research visa to flee the country because they knew that nazi germany was coming and they knew where they were going to end up and he recognized that a lot of the people that he lived with were not going to be able to get out he's like if they're going to have to go through this i'm going to go through go through this and it's so it's spread into these different parts uh the last part is kind of his experience with people who actually made it through and had a hard time readjusting because they couldn't they couldn't adjust their attitude they just held on to this resentment the bitter bitterness so many life lessons to be learned from from that one really really hard to read a lot of unspeakable evil things that he experienced but i feel like it's one of those books you gotta take your medicine and uh you're a better person for having gone through it can i admit to something here uh in high school uh i enjoyed that book so much especially the the last section not especially but in addition at the end he has his logo therapy where he talks about meaning through suffering and i know as an impressionable teenager i never returned it back to my english class i just kept it so you know i'm sorry miss barrack because uh you didn't get the book back from me it just left such an impression yeah okay that's a really good note to end on but there are a few questions and i just was hoping you're the only one that can really answer this but what's the difference between what the sweet set setup course is offering on obsidian versus your experiences with the linking your thinking workshop because you're the only one who knows both oh boy it's a tough one all right so linking you're thinking that the workshop requires a whole lot of work on your end it's worth it that capstone project that you force everybody to do that's essential to what you're going to get out of the the course you're showing up live and you're you're doing it uh the sweet setup is on demand videos so it's more tactical i would say there's a lot of really practical things that you share to nick but like that's the whole goal of the suite setup is we want to help people be more productive and more creative using their apple technology and there's going to be people on different ends of the spectrum but like even like the zero to obsidian workshop which is kind of the the very first version of this course was like okay we're going to assume you know nothing about obsidian we're going to help you identify one specific thing one specific pain point in your note-taking workflow and by the end of the two-hour workshop you're gonna have a system in place which is going to provide you value it's very different than like here's everything that you need to consider when crafting your own pkm system and now you have to have to do it and i'm not saying one is is the right way i feel these are very complimentary in fact um i've learned a lot from nick you'll see in the course some of the the notes that i i captured and i point people to linking your thinking all all of the time but i'm not trying to just like recreate what you've done either there are certain things that have rubbed off on me you know and i'm going to put my own spin on some of the stuff and talk about like the atomic note taking and breaking things down into the itty bitty pieces because that's what allowed like the sermon sketch notes to click for me right so i will say this is the way that i do this and if you're looking to do something similar you should do it this way too there's a whole list of like these are the recommended plugin settings if you're new to this and you don't know what any of this sort of stuff is a whole lot of workflow specific stuff here's how you you here's how you could use this for project uh managing a project here's my writing workflow thing is in there stuff like that yeah well thanks for that mike and i will say what i could imagine you know depending on your time and resources uh financially but you know start off with uh mike's and you know if if you want to i think with linking of thinking it's a broader approach to it intentionally so of how it's not a course on obsidian um it's it's it's a course it's a workshop on how we go about thinking about managing information we look at our relationship to information and with this age of the linked note how we can use that to be our best selves and create a system that will scale with us over time and so i do from what i understand see them as quite complementary and but as far as you know getting you know up to speed with obsidian and tailoring that to a use case of yours it sounds like you know i i can't recommend uh mike's enough like start with that and then see where see where you're at if you want to keep going deeper down the rabbit hole and the thing i will say with um linking your thinking is it's also a community yes i think that's i think that's where a lot of the crazy value is coming from it's like going to thinking camp yeah yeah but uh but enough of everything uh one last time round of applause mike this was just fantastic thank you thank you so much for coming on for sure thanks for having me yeah i have a couple books to look into now and if i use your rule i should just go ahead and see if i can purchase them just i am yep [Music] you
