if you are tired of being pushed into rigid productivity systems that leave you feeling burnt out check this out nadja bester shares a glimpse into one of the freshest pkm showcases i've seen it's called the vault diverse and true to the name it is a universe of information for nadja spanning the gamut from life management to writing to running a startup the subconscious is a well that demands filling but in a busy life it's easy to end up on empty which leads to burnout just like the vultiverse nadja is a bit of everything a serial entrepreneur a startup advisor a player in marketing and communications consulting for companies that have raised over 300 million dollars and that's along with being a journalist non-profit board member mom and an ongoing coveted refugee not just showcase intrigued me because even with so much going on she took it in a different direction instead of focusing on hyper productivity she focuses on feeding her subconscious is that valuable yes it is maybe more than we know let's tour naja's vultavers now so without further ado my home note is where i enter the labyrinth into my volteves and it's interesting that in english we barely differentiate between a labyrinth and a maze but in essence a maze has all these different offshoots that could get you lost whereas a labyrinth is like a singular part to the center and that really is what this labyrinth volteves does for me even when it feels like i'm moving away from it i know there's this you know i'm kind of i always head back to it and prior to taking the course i didn't fully appreciate the power of having this kind of true north node my approach was very chaotic in the sense that i would open my vault and 100 bottom up i would get drawn into whatever note i happen to see or open or create and so this really functions as a sanctuary where i can you know come here and this is what i do so the first thing i see is i have these sort of quick start like a little small hack and this is really just because i have a varying capacity for noise so sometimes i am able to get into the vault you know kind of click down into things but often i really just want to see the bit like the absolute essentials so i toggle the below based on kind of how i feel and what i want so this why am i here section which is modeled after the what it was called what i want this honors the fact that the volteverse is such an all-encompassing space for me i enter it for many different purposes as many different version as versions of myself so it really tries to be respectful in helping like different knees navigate kind of what's here and and what what you know where i'm at and where i want to go so the first one what i do when i get here okay so i need direction and then i go to the daily moc and this is really just what's important on any given day and so this is kind of like a mvp for living so just the bare essentials that i need to get by when i need to anchor myself this is where the snapshot comes in so it helps me get current so the work moc is you know where the serious stuff goes down i can maybe quickly go in there so i kind of have things here grouped by like company by a role by like industry so it's very sort of you know this is yeah this is the serious stuff and that's not really what i want my showcase to be about because as you'll see i really try to make my vault my friend and that means that as a friend you know it's not just work but it's play as well so the projects the courses and my writing they all feature like past present and future things that i'm working on have worked on will work on the who am i not yeah this is a it's like a gel of all trades note for anything me related that i want or need to keep track of life by date i'm not really sure i'm gonna keep i'll quickly just open it so this is based on how i or maybe i can show you this instead so when i do my daily journaling i kind of link by the year by the month of the year by the month itself and then also by the date of the year but like by the day of the year so i like this because i'm able to kind of click into it and you know see what i was doing on previous days or months or whatever so the life by date is kind of the catch-all for this but i don't think i'm gonna keep it but i'm parking it here and then if there's uptake you know whatever let's see it's a complete work in progress every day of the year so uh the deep dives yeah this is really uh i like obsessing over things like really obsessing over something for a short period of time and then i move on and so this is kind of here because this is the latest thing that i'm obsessed by and then once i'm done with it for the moment it goes into this wake the hungry bear and that's where it hibernates and waits for me to love it again and yeah these things can be a huge time suck because like these temporary passionate obsessions take up a lot of my time so i treat them with kit gloves i also have a different section for permanent deep dives but that lives in projects all right so then if i need support so this is also here in the quick start again just my wellness moc which really is just to you know help me function optimally the recovery one is when things are not going well and i need like tlc guidance support reminders whatever the people moc and maybe i can just click into this one so this is really just something that helps me to people so there's a lot of stuff about my son there's just general kind of you know how to deal with other humans and then there's also like a roller decks of just the who's who of people who are in my life all right so feeling inspired so yeah the previous one ground control was really when i you know i need to kind of i need my vault as my friend the feeling inspired one is like okay this i have all this energy i want to geek out like this is again a dangerous place because i can really lose days here but concepts interest symbolism they're all very fertile breeding grounds for ideas and connections which is one of the primary reasons why i use obsidian involved and then the things i keep track of that's like random delicacies like metaphors analogies great openings and books that i'm kind of you know collecting so that's fun stuff yeah then i guess sometimes when i've been too closely involved with the everyday uh i zoom out a little bit then i need some perspective so like the life trademark is a very fun thing that i've been working on it's like my theory on living very creative name by the way and so the mindsets one i mean that's that's what it says on the box um but it's also something like a cool little learning project that i'm working with my son on so these things something that i have to be in the mood for and i don't really know how to describe that mood but when i'm in that mood i know to go there and then the last one and this is really what i want my showcase to be about is for everything else that was not you know kind of caught above uh there's pythia and so yeah with that let's go visit her so if i don't feed my subconscious i quickly run into this sort of meaning making deficit and in my psyche that's like similar to oxygen deprivation so i'm constantly trying out new things some of which work some of which don't but i guess the process and it's just a good dose of experimentation and play that's very often the reward itself so i love clicking on things it's like the digital version of exploring someone else's ethic and i have very fond memories of that you know in real life so my intention is to create this wonderland of randomness discovery especially in this section i mean i have that elsewhere in the vault as well but everywhere else it's very cognitive whereas here it's you know all about like intuition and yeah it's just i love this place and so yeah i do a lot of thinking and creating elsewhere in the vulture so i think is like this portal into i don't know a different world like stepping through the veil there's no reason there's not even a lot of rhyme there's just like this bunch of chaotic neutral like free association and like active imagination so what i do is when i get here and it also depends on kind of what mood i'm in so i can either click here wait let me do the nice view okay so here's a little story a little narrative that i've written for myself i sometimes use it to get in the mood so just to give you a brief rundown okay i'm sitting in the library i'm noticing some details and then i see this strange looking woman all right something tells me the call to adventure of course if you know uh joseph campbell's hero quest or hero journey something catches my eye and i follow her all right so now we get into the meet so there she is she's waiting for me and she offers me a choice of two doors so i get to choose and am i an alchemist or a seeker today so i don't think i'll have time to show you the alchemist but just to kind of give you an idea that's a space that offers more creative constraints and it relies heavily on like the graph view and linking so i happen to be in a seeker mode anyway so all right now i enter i see i have a choice place or a key so i go down okay there's four more choices very good so let's see what do i have time for so the library of similar simple andrea i've never actually said that out loud that is just kind of a an easier to digest version of the symbolism mrc um because i don't want to wander off too much into the cognitive side when i'm here it's just more for play so i'm going to skip that one the mind melt magic that's fresh off the price so there's not really that much to show yet so okay so let's do the walk through words so if i click in here the first thing i do is i can start with any word that catches my so let's do genius and so okay now i have a quote and this is you know any quote that has caught my attention and when i put it in here i link every word so as you can see a lot of these words are not yet linked and that's part of the deliciousness because the next time that i'm in here then i can you know put a new quote for that word but then one of them at least is and so i can click into that one now i have a new quote and i have all these other links a lot of which have not been fold so i can just kind of keep on clicking into different links with different quotes it's not the the key here is not really saving quotes i do that elsewhere and it's not really to understand kind of why i care about this note right now or you know why is it significant to me it's like an open invitation and anything can happen here and this is what i what i really love about this all right so let's forgot to pin the other one so let's just go way back so i'm here and then the last thing is i'll take you on this weird little ride and like i said you know really just to emphasize this is so much about play for me if i start wondering kind of why i do this and what the what the meaning and the reason is then i lose the charm so this is usually something i i just have this random sentence that pops into my head and then i'll make a note and if i click into this note like as you can tell this was like fridge poetry this one i mean it has absolutely no meaning but it's just fun so if i click into it and then there's another one and then there's another one and it just keeps on going and every time that i have kind of a new you know a new thought or a sentence but it has to be random it's not something that i'm gonna work on later on then i just add it here um yeah and this is just a lot of fun and the reason that i wanted to show this as my showcase is because i think i had for a long time this idea of how serious obsidian and pkm must be and i and i looked for my fun elsewhere but as i said in the beginning like i really wanted to make my vault my friend and so this is part of their journey it's it meets me where i am instead of me kind of having to be in a certain mood when i get into it so yeah thank you so much for going on a journey with me yeah with that i shall pause nadja's showcase is a reminder that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and trying to fit your feet in someone else's shoes is only good for getting you blisters i don't know about you but i'm inspired to feed my own subconscious and now i have a few ideas hopefully this showcase gave you some inspiration on how you can do the same what is something you took away from watching this let us know in the comments below and if you liked it make
