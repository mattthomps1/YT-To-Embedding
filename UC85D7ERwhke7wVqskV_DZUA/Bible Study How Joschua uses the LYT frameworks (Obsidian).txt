if you are wondering how to manage the big works you know the big ones then you'll want to see how joshua manages scripture in obsidian in what he calls biblical connected thinking joshua was born and raised in germany but is now working out of sweden for a christian non-profit in the last few years his work has taken him to 15 countries and in the last year alone he has read over 50 books on a wide array of topics relating them to scripture in a sprawling tapestry interweaving philosophy technology productivity theology and culture in the following tour joshua shows us how he manages many of these various inputs in one master system let's view joshua's presentation now yeah so there we go i believe you all should be able to to see the screen now yeah just a small framing about who i am i'm 22 years old i'm from germany but living in sweden right now and i'm working with a christian non-profit and that's focused on on youth and young people and mobilizing them to volunteering in in mission and um like development projects in with different cultures so yeah as a part of my work and my interest it's quite quite broad like it's a christian non-profit so yeah i'm thinking a lot about like scripture and the bible but less in a theological way and more and like a personal way of applying it and and also on the implication of the thoughts in there on on society on a greater scale um yeah and politics so my personal knowledge management system is yeah it's it's a big bundle of a lot of different things and interests and nick was really flattering but i think some of your guys's system are way way more advanced than mine but let's jump into it so just recently i started kind of reframing things a little bit and i introduced those tags of like seedling budding and evergreen like i really like the garden metaphor when it comes to growing our ideas and thoughts and i started taking just a couple of notes to kind of see in which stage they are at and then looking at the index i i broke it down in a couple of different areas um i have a top of mind um note with like kind of the quick paths to the notes that i use more most than i really like the the framing often i want to note because often i'm quite overwhelmed when i um looking at all the different possibilities and this gives me some actionable things that i can i can actually do yeah and then recently i i started introducing the idea of tending the garden attending my mind garden and taking care of this collection and i feel like i have a lot of just notes that i might never find again because they're they're unlinked like we talked about these tk nodes and i just created a saved search to to find all of my tk nodes and then i pull them in here and i can see what is relevant and what i want to flash out a little bit more there's also this plugin to find unlinked files so recently i noticed since when my collection grows and a lot of it is not so connected that i want to want to take care and and find those lost seeds and nuggets yeah maybe a bit more on there i i want to know it so yeah but i want to do like here another link to like tending the garden kind of that metaphor or growing materials we'll get to recipes later but a couple of of different ways i could i could use my library and i like having actionable paths yeah then getting getting more into the meat of it this is like the growing ideas section so a lot of it for me is is about faith um is yeah about meditating on scripture and understanding the implications so yeah i've i have a couple of overview notes here a couple of big mocs like i pulled put the bible into obsidian yeah so in here of all of the books of the bible can jump straight into one but also have an overview kind of on on each books and like big big impactful events that i can get linked to in other ways yet so just to show that like here's all of it put in and i can always navigate to the next chapter but also jump back to the overview note um and then there here are a couple of of different mocs on on different topics yeah both like more abstract but also quite practical thinking about i'm married uh even being 22 thinking about marriage and and living that out well a quick question for you joshua yeah when you were in genesis i was just curious how you were handling the the verses on the left-hand side yes that's how you handle the categorization yeah so that's um that's just some some custom css and so these are all um like heading six headers yeah i think thanks for jumping in there and to make reading a bit easier i yeah i pulled it to the side so if i was to create a new note um i could quite easily just reference um a specific scripture and then put a verse in and if i want to embed that it seems a bit in the way yeah so what is great um is also like jumping into into the backlinks here um because then i have all of the references to to specific verses just in here when i pull up the the chapter yeah so thinking about like genesis introducing the story this like ties in and it's quite foundational to understand the text so it ties into a lot of like different notes i have like talking about creation of course where reference and specific things and specifics um things that are recorded yeah but also like different like different teachings or sermons that i've heard it's quite easily to reference and whenever i just come across um reading the text or if i want to prepare teaching i can go in there and see all of my backlinks and all of the thoughts that i already have on there so it grows very organically and i i love it about that um yeah then this is a book note for example um where the author quoted a part and i have all of my things just in there yeah i hope that made made sense so far do you mind if i ask a question on that yeah sure go ahead can you go back to where you're looking at the bible and you had your notes on the right hand side yeah so just like that you mean yeah yeah are you happy to actually show a note i mean i know you've got them all there on the right hand side yeah just show us a note that actually so i could see the links back to the bible there are sure it's okay if you're not yeah yeah absolutely so for example like here note i have on the creation narrative as a whole in at the top i i have a link um to just like jump into the start of it yeah then there are like a couple of notes to other references um yeah i think like here on god's drawing joy from his labor that's where i reference this specific verse and then like give it the different alias um or so so i i know where where this is said actually okay i see how you've done that and how you've linked that to genesis on the side there however when you're reading genesis is there a way of actually going from genesis to those notes yeah so i think i hope i understand you right but yeah that would be the backlinks here on the side yeah so talking about like the note of the creation account that i just showed and here it shows me the back link to god destroying joy from slaver god so it was good yeah thanks very much i think i've got what you're doing there yep thank you yeah cool great uh yeah thanks for jumping in yeah in in the forum i like in this self i i posted like there's a thread on on how people organize the bible and there are a lot of great great thoughts in there as well in the script to get all of this in here yeah but but it's a constant way of figuring things out yeah great um yeah for in interest um nick introduced this this way like structuring it in different ways and i like um here that's an embedded bible verse so i like for kind of every every area that i'm interested in actually pulling in is scripture and because i want the text to be quite central to my life so i i i want to see what um what the bible says about every aspect and make it very practical yeah so in here are also a couple of different mocs and notes i'm not sure what if that is so specifically interesting right now so yeah and here's like kind of the last big one on on knowledge management again with the bible verse pulled in here and kind of talking about how how i use that um how i do my tagging which is quite like i don't use a lot of tags i like to pair take like outputs or things writings that i put out in the world and then input which is kind of everything i i receive in sources um yeah and and most of my input i get get from books i don't have a lot of articles to go through and process so and for me it's quite yeah very simple just going for output and input but for other people the workflow might look very very different yes cool and i see that you have uh you you have a emojis on your tags how do you do that i mean yeah so yeah i can just come to uh to type them or how do you tie them so yeah it's it's a bit cumbersome too like i couldn't pick a specific one here but because i only have a handful of tags um they just show up at the top and got it and that's how i get them yeah thanks yeah i i'm not so sure with the phrasing but like strengthening the worker kind of so this is more about like my personal growth i like the idea of a mission statement so like what's the personal creed what are the things that are important to me and i continue to add on to that yeah this one moc on on the body or health which like there's not a lot in there and then one on on productivity on work and the opportunity and the the importance of that um yeah and quite a bit of that is is also connected to yeah to to what the scripture says on on work so how workers flow both a blessing but can also be a temptation like yeah finding your your identity and so on and when we jump into one of those notes um oh yeah i like having the the origin to specific books that i read um in the notes when it works um but yeah talking specifically about how how broke is uh how work is broken and yeah how it can not be be good for us like a link to that would be to the tower of babel's story which is also like connected to to the bible and in here i pulled a couple of different bible verses in in again and i could jump straight into the text there just to show different aspects yeah i think this i think this specific unit is about processing new new information right yeah so yeah that's correct yeah great yeah so for me that's and yeah has way better stuff to share than me but just how it how it looks like for me is is mostly mostly books so i like with an iframe like kind of putting in my goodreads um process um and then um i process like books by by different tags i classify them by genre and kind of have two ways of doing it and one is like formatting and writing an outline so i think for example like first things first by um stephen colby like just pulling the kidney highlights in here um is quite unstructured so yeah i had the little tag to to outline it and then the next step would be to to process books so looking at its seven seven habits if i pull up the outline like here are things organized a bit more neatly by specific headers and topics and then the third step or like the second step to process it would go to go through it and like scratch what is not relevant and make new notes out of other things that i actually found find helpful um so that's kind of how how i process books yeah i i like using using templates for different things so yeah i have like specific metadata for for books i put in the author the year published and then like when i read it in a month so i can compile that into the months um and have a couple of of other templates on different inputs or outputs just to keep things um standardized and i think like doing it right in obsidian the most straightforward way um is probably just like having if i have my book template here every time i create a new book note just i'm copying that um in there if you don't want to work with with templates or explainers but yeah you guys are going to get get more into that as a bit of a last fun thing um i started putting a couple of recipes in in obsidian yeah so i can browse that by um by tag um i take things by ingredient or or by recipe so over here just a couple of different ingredients and let's say i have a lot of dried beans in my pantry i can open that up and i really like that i can straighten put some instructions on how to how to in that way and prepare beans whenever i need that and i already put in like some some use cases uh nachos for example but yeah i can also go into the backlink section and for yeah whatever i use it refried beans or tortillas or nachos um i can see that straight in in there and i think that's a really fun way to to see whatever i want to come up with um or i browse it by recipe and and can see the the couple ones that i that i put in there and that's yeah mostly just copy and paste from the website wherever i find it yeah i think this is like a broad overview um i could go into into much much more detail i also do do journaling and in there for some self-reflection but hopefully that gives a couple of ideas on on what it could look like and you pick out the things that work for you i don't have a template for for journaling so it's really just like flow of consciousness um writing out and writing up my thoughts but i do like to to compile um all of these individual daily notes i have into let's see if i have a good example like first into weekly notes like weekly journals and kind of summarizing what the week was like and then um pulling that together into a monthly note yeah so this is yeah just like from a script generated like a calendar overview where i can see where journals on on which on each month and then i like putting into like look back on the month write a couple of paragraphs on what happened i ended up with corona that month i'm i'm healthy now so that's great but that'll be great to look back to you and i have yeah my my journals in here and yeah i don't journal every day like it really wasn't a lot yeah and then also what i what i read this month or what kind of of gatherings or conferences i was i was a part of um yeah and then looking back on the yeah i can kind of see what what happened each month well this is yeah this is great so at this point let's uh send off joshua i hope you
