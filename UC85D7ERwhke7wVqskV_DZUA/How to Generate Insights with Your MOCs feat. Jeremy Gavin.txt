if you're wondering how to take any topic and generate valuable insights prepare to receive great value from this presentation by jeremy gavin jeremy works in digital marketing advertising and digital ad tech by profession he also teaches digital marketing short courses and is an insatiable generalist at heart naturally gravitating towards breadth of knowledge rather than depth and like many of us jeremy has struggled with balancing consumption with creation in the following jeremy shares his results in focusing on one topic and deepening his insights around it using an moc a map of content that topic is on aphorisms what is an aphorism and how are they like a horizon and why do they require brilliance and why is this presentation so fascinating i'll share my opinion why at the end let's view jeremy's process now today i'm gonna go through my uh moc on aphorisms which is this little node here within my graph so i'm not going to kind of go through my entire graph i'm going to keep it really kind of focused um so aphorisms was one that i wanted to look at because i had very mixed feelings towards aphorisms and so and just to kick off or go into what an aphorism actually is which was a difficult thing to define for me so the standard dictionary response response for what is an aphorism is that it's a pithy succinct saying that attempts to capture a truth about the world uh but as with a lot of dictionary uh definitions it lacks a bit of context and and content it's more about how people use that word rather than what it actually is uh so a principle that i've come to use when uh trying to find out what uh something actually is is going down to the etymological roots uh to build an understanding around a word from a first principles where did this come from uh what are the components of the word so the etymology of an aphorism it's actually derived from the word horizon so a boundary or a or a definitive boundary so it's kind of like a barrier between understanding um and then the infinite beyond that so an aphorism is like the demarcation of something it's that it's a definitive line on the distance that someone else draws for you so if we go into if we have a look at my linked thought of what an aphorism is and looking at the etymology so i was reading a book called the theory of an aphorism and the horizon analogy got kind of taken to the next level and it was the the horizon is a superficial boundary um and as you approach it it always kind of moves away from you so with an aphorism when someone when a smart person goes and puts a definition or a line between the universe and the infinite and what we understand we can look at it and say okay yep sure i agree with you that's the that's the horizon or we can walk towards it and while we may not we may not ever reach the horizon the journey itself is can be very enlightening on all of the things you find along the way even though the horizon is always there on the distance so i went back and had a look at like what was the actual first aphorism that came about and what's it what's the origin story of an aphorism and it was actually uh hippocrates the father of uh modern well not modern medicine but uh but medicine in general and the very first aphorism uh attributed to him was life is short and the art is long uh expanding that out blowing it up uh the crisis is fleeting the experience perilous the decision are difficult and really talks to the the plight of a doctor a human life is short and then the actual act of learning about how to extend a human life or to or to learn about how to save a human life is a really long effort that takes which can never really be achieved again it's it's a horizon and so that's a very difficult conflict for a doctor to face and so the original aphorisms were heuristics about how to deal with uh with health issues and um and medicine and i've done a bit of interpretation so interpretation was an important thing for me when looking into these aphorisms so the reason that i became interested in aphorisms were for a couple of reasons i read this quote by susan sontag farnam street which is another great website that looks at mental models and things like that and in the article it was a quote from one of her books and she really railed against aphorism so aphoristic thinking is impatient thinking it's the commodification of knowledge it's aristocratic thinking smart people handing down ideas um and expecting you to accept it without question so the other book that i read the theory of aphorism was more apologetic towards it so that's more the problem of aphorisms but the benefit of aphorisms um according uh to that book was that was that aphorisms are atomic due to the potential that they contain so in defense of the aphorism it is a low barrier to entry for deep thinking it's a sentence or a paragraph that once you explode it out it's kind of atomic not in the same way that we talk about it with evergreen evergreen notes it's more the bonds that are within the aphorism once you start tearing them apart they explode with energy when you start to interpret them but that also requires that also requires the the aphorism requires both the writer and the reader to be brilliant so if you just take an aphorism at face value you're running the risk of running into the commodification of knowledge like susan sontag was talking about so i wanted to look at aphorisms as a way of reducing my consumption because an aphorism is just a small pithy sentence and then in the act of interpreting it meant that i could jump in and and start to do some thinking of my own and i'm blowing up these atomic aphorisms and getting into my own thoughts as a way of doing this filtering and reducing the noise by not having words and words and words on the page i was still running across some some conflicts with that because there are problems with aphorism so the thing about naphorism is it needs it it's pithy and it's it's kind of poetic in a lot of ways and so anaphorism support really comes from the resonance that it has in people's hearts and minds and not necessarily not necessarily from evidence and logic and you need to trust that the uh it's an abstraction of something at the end of the day so you need to trust that the person who has written the aphorism has done the work and aphorisms are really disarming in their simplicity and their aesthetic so this is just a little something i wrote they dissolve like a sugary pill or a supposed truth and we move on to the next sweet treat without questioning it and it's nutritional content i used to find that with like inspirational quotes and things which are a lot different from an aphorism but but they can be the same you just consume them and consume them and eat them and eat them and you don't blow them up and and look at what their content is and then also the aphorism is not so humble it's it's coming from a smart mind and sometimes smart minds there's a bit of intelligence arrogance they don't feel like they need to put the work in to justify things because they're so used to being right and so they can stand there they've just got a really good pedigree coming from the brain of someone smart and i found that by i found reading to uh taleb nicholas taleb a lot of his aphorisms were there was such a great volume of them that it was yeah it was you could tell that he thought he was right but i without going i i felt like i really need to go deeper into it so let's talk about some aphorism of the types of aphorisms that are out there so i really enjoyed kind of breaking it down into the types of aphorisms that you can find this is just a few i think there were eight but uh you've got the the moral so another distinction of the aphorism is that it really should feel like a truth from all of the perspectives that someone can look at that aphorism from so the moral you've got the the golden rule but then also every lies and assault and autonomy of those who lie to us um sam harris online the observation in comparison um it's just a comparison of our current state of being to a seeming ideal uh so i hate it this is the most boring aphorism that i've probably ever heard but children are naturally inquisitive and open-minded we adults could learn something from them it's a it's an example of an observation but i i definitely want to replace that one um it was from a youtube video um that i was watching uh the paradox the older we get the more like a child we become uh the chiasmus is probably my favorite slash least favorite because it is one of the most poetic ones it's one of the ones that you'll come across uh most out on like twitter and the internet um and it can be really appealing because it it just has that nice beautiful abba type structure so it goes if you have and you can kind of see an example of the a bba structure there it crosses over so if you have nothing to do do nothing so nothing is a do b b do a nothing you can see it in this one by a chekhov as well in nature a repulsive caterpillar turns into a lovely butterfly but with human beings it is the other way around a lovely butterfly turns into a repulsive caterpillar and i've tried to do a little bit of interpretation on that but yes the chiasmus is uh it's a tricky one and and you and you do kind of see it a lot and you need to be careful of it because it is aesthetically pleasing when it is presented in that way which can cause you it makes it a little more sugary with that sugar pill uh kind of metaphor so i did some attempts on interpreting some aphorisms but first of all aphorisms that make me laughed i found the best aphorisms with those that kind of lay humanity flat with a scathing routine critique uh often so brutal you just have to laugh so chekhov was one of them another one from pascal man judge of all things feeble earthworm repository of truth sink of doubt and error glory and refuse of the universe just uh it's hilarious um and it's a paradox as well so you can kind of see that structure of the um of the aphorism there so every part of that uh of that aphorism was a paradox judge of all things but a feeble earthworm a repository of truth but a sink of doubt and error glory and refuse of the universe and then i really like this one from huxley because i was uh talking a bit about i was i've been thinking a lot about identity and um and cognition and and labels that we put on things and i found that was a great way to approach aphorisms because if you're thinking about something already um i got this great book called the vikings book of aphorisms which was written in 65 and it was beautiful because it had this index at the back where you could look up certain words and so when i went to an aphorism that was focusing on a very specific thing that i was thinking about it made me dive into it more so i found that as a really useful way of approaching it but my interpretation of this one tolerable tolerably early in life i discovered that one of uh that one of the unpardonable sins in the eyes of most people is for a man person to go about unlabeled uh the world regards such a person as the police do an unmuzzled dog um and this is where the the terminology of um and when you go into context which is also very important for naturalism finding the original context it was the root of his coining of the term agnosticism so one of his great frustrations was being labeled as an empiricist or a materialist so thomas huxley was darwin's kind of attack dog he went out there and and fought for evolution to get uh put in place and that got him labeled with a lot of things but as an agnostic it was not to be a label in itself but to be a claim of the limits of our knowledge so again that horizon idea kind of popping up again there are certain things beyond our cognition agnosticism simply acknowledges that so agnosticism is the antithesis of a label and it's an unconditional surrender to hypocognition so hypocognition is when you lack the uh the linguistic framework or the cognitive framework to process raw information around you and a lot of the time we're not aware of it but agnosticism is kind of being aware of uh not having that framework and then still but kind of leaning into it and around identity i think maybe sometimes we need to be a little more agnostic around who someone is just because they exhibit certain features doesn't necessarily mean that they're they're part of a certain group and i just thought that was uh that was an important uh take out which wasn't necessarily what he was talking about but something that linked my thinking when you do look at that graph you can see it linking up into that identity mrc as well so i've done a lot of ranting and rambling and everything like that so i'll uh i'll open it up i suppose i know i was very focused towards one uh specific things so yeah any other questions beyond that i'm happy to answer as well seeing jeremy's process is greatly inspiring but why is it so special well besides the fascinating topic it's because jeremy shows us a blueprint on how to take any topic and generate tremendous value from exploring it so if you are tired of over consuming and under thinking and you know there's a better way this blueprint offers a way out of the noise and back to the signal it's note making not note taking thank you jeremy for showing how to raise your thinking game as a note maker as always there are so many more fascinating and inspiring people i hope to showcase with you because they show how personal the process of thinking and managing knowledge can be and they give us glimpses and illumination into how we can take our thinking games to the next level if you enjoyed this just like one of the comments below and i'll see you next time
