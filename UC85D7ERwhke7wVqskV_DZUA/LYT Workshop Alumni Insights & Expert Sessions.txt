alumni from the linking or thinking workshop and also our subject matter experts for the upcoming Workshop 10. so if you are considering and taking the linking your thinking Workshop this event will be a really great place for you to learn more what it's all about how it's going to work you'll get to hear from our fellow alumni members so grateful for you for for them to be here and also you'll get to hear from our subject matter experts and of course if you do have any questions about the workshop we'd be so happy to answer them give you more clarity so that you can make a decision moving

good to be here you'll hear a little bit from me I have a couple new fun things I'm excited to share with you but mostly you're going to hear from everyone else their insights their experiences learning getting a little bit better with how they manage knowledge um but yeah it is a little chilly here over in Los Angeles maybe it's in the mid 50s uh Fahrenheit I'm I'm just joking I know it's cold in other places but let's move on I'm going to throw the mic over to Avril hey guys I'm swimming from uh Austin I'm super excited uh to be here to share my experience and my lights um experience

to be with everyone here I pass to Andrew hi everyone good morning good afternoon Andrew Marty here joining you from Cloudy Decatur Georgia today so I'm excited to talk to you about my lessons learned from like cohort 8 and how these structures have really helped me build a sustainable practice of creation so with that I'm going to pass it to Alicia hey guys thank you for having me here my name is Alicia I'm in Spanish but I call from the Netherlands where it's also cold and cloudy so I'm in good company and yes I was joining the The Last Link in your thinking Workshop nine and it is an honor to be here with these fantastic people and I'm looking forward to share with you about the intangibles of the link in your thinking Workshop and with that I will pass to Bianca hi thanks Alicia my name is Bianca I have been with flight for two years already I was just counting agua uh so I can share a little bit of my experience today as an alumni and also now as a one of the subject matter experts so we talked a little bit about the research and how we can use light for the purpose of research so I'm very happy to be here it's my second live stream and I know the energy is really high so I really like it so with that I'll pass to you uh Sana hey thank you Bianca I'm so excited you guys it is freezing cold almost freezing cold in Boston 33 degrees um and I have to go outside today but it's light Workshop 10 you guys I've been here since cohort 2 and I'm excited to be back as an um as part of the expert guided sessions talking about content creation and brand building my goal is to help you shape your PKM so you can position yourself as an expert but with that I'm going to pass this over to Nick for an overview all right got the mic again thank you Santa and I think should I just throw it back to you Dan for a moment or should I go right into it yeah just for a moment Nick I just want to I just want to greet some some people in the chat John Crosby is here hey hey there John so happy that you are joining us here in the chat so super grateful we have a couple of alumni members as well be here with us you can type in the chat where you're coming from how you're feeling we you know we we are really really grateful to be opening up the light Workshop once again and enrollments are currently open so the enrollment if you want to learn more you can head to the chat Keaton my good friend he is our Workshop director he's going to be sharing the link and when you see that link click that link and it will Port you to our website where you can sign up if you like and also Bianca is sharing here a QR code so if you like that oh that's pretty cool thank you Bianca and then just uh before I turn it over to you Nick I just want to share with everyone here who is present live or maybe watching the stream later on there's four things that I I want to ask from you number one is as we're as you're listening to our alumni my guest speakers are subject matter experts feel free to comment comment comment comment in the chat right there say something what you're hearing what you're listening if something is resonating with you that would be greatly appreciated so we can know like what is you know how we can connect more even with you guys number two is feel free to ask any questions to any of our alumni speakers and to our experts number three don't forget that we're gonna have a good time and a lot of fun today and number four keep looking at the link that magical link will give you information good information and with that uh the next part of our program today we're gonna we're gonna talk with Nick and ask him for an overview what is light by the way light is lyt linking your thinking what is linking your thinking what is the link in your thinking Workshop all about and who is it for Nick the floor is yours thank you Dan now for the first part uh just think for a second you don't have to give a plus one in the chat unless you want to but just think for a second maybe nod your head or shake your head but you'll probably nod your head if you've ever had a whole day that you spent just organizing your digital stuff like an entire day just that's all you did I definitely have I've done that many times and every time I do it I think I've created the perfect system but inevitably just like sand castles on the beach it gets washed away with the first wave so where did we go wrong well we we've we're trying to do something in fact I kept this book handy we're trying to figure this out what to do with all this information that's causing us anxiety what do we do with it and so this is a place this Workshop where we get answers to that and we apply it to whatever we are trying to do in our lives and we can maybe classify them into six major categories and try to think which ones really apply to you like what is your top one out of these six they should probably most of them will apply in different levels but here we go number one do you want to do better with researching things being able to process large amounts of information and synthesize it into something that you can then share with others that's clear and cohesive do you want to make just generally better sense of the world you have so many interests I think if you're listening right now you have a tremendous amount of things that you're just naturally interested in you're probably a fun person to be around because you just you're like oh wow tell me more that's interesting hey how how was that designed how was this developed and you're asking these questions but what do you do with all that and how do you combine it into something that can be even more meaningful for you how do you find those patterns that's number two number three you would just want to create consistently one of the benefits of being really good with knowledge is that if you want to you can be a Content creation machine I've definitely noticed that in myself and that was not my intention getting into this but if you love Reading Writing teaching sharing you can have a consistent way to unlock and share your unique perspective that's number three so final final ones here number four sometimes we're writing really complex stuff this may or may not apply to you but if it does if you're writing that thousand page novel like one of our subject matter experts you need to be able to manage a lot of complex thoughts tremendous amount of World building information and then push it out there so for those longer pieces of writing that would be a use case for number four and then for number five and this is kind of where I I think why I love it is that kind of like the joy-based side of things along with the sense making is just understanding how I want to operate in the world like what type of life I'd like to leave and you could call this self-guidance journaling understanding what do you stand for what does your life experiences mean what are you proud of what aren't you proud of how do you want to direct yourself in the future and then the sixth one is to be more productive with your efforts to get more things done we don't lead with that one but that can Fuel and give us a bit of a strategy and Direction with all of our different use cases with Knowledge Management so just take a moment is are you are you here for the research are you here for the sense making the content creation the big writing projects the self-reflection the production see how those ones are resonating if you are here for any of those in various amounts this type of Workshop this type of community is the place to be there's truly nothing like it uh there's truly nothing like this in the world of Knowledge Management and it gets pigeonholed sometimes for people just thinking of content creation but it's so much more than just that it gets pigeonholed sometimes oh let's just get things done and cross off the next task but there's so much more to it than that and the best way to articulate that and then I'm going to pass it back I'm going to pass it back to you Dan but the best way to articulate what Knowledge Management is all about is that famous story that David Foster Wallace gave that keynote in about 2005 a keynote ceremony and it's about these fish that are swimming these two fish are swimming and they pass an older fish and the old fish says how's the water boys the two younger fish keep on swimming and then one turns to the other and says what the heck is water for us information is our water and we're swimming in it we're reading countless articles countless videos we spend our waking moments swimming in this mess of information if we want to be able to make sense of it effectively we have to somehow figure out how to turn information into personal knowledge and then it's like we've given ourselves a new set of spells or a new sword that we can wield and we can do amazing things with that how can we convert the information into usable meaningful knowledge that's what we figure out in the workshop and we do it so you have your custom system that works for you so I hopefully that gives you a greater sense of what we're trying to do in this world of Knowledge Management and now I'll turn it back to the one the only Dan lardy all right thank you Nick information anxiety man Nick that that resonates a lot with me I'm looking at you know my own Tendencies having too many tabs um there's too too much information how do I deal with that you know it can get overwhelming um and and with this Workshop you get to learn more um dealing that that that pain point right there and right now I do want to say hello to the people in the chat we have Yolanda hi Yolanda thank you for being here and Julie thank you for being here and if you're just jumping into our stream right now welcome we want to welcome you this is the light Workshop alumni insights and expert sessions where you get to know more about what the light Workshop is hear from our alumni ins from our alumni members and get to know our subject matter experts for the upcoming Workshop Workshop 10. now you've heard a lot from Nick uh if you're subscribed to our email you've heard from Nick I'm talking about what the workshop is all about you heard the overview today we wanted you to hear from some of our loit or linking your thinking Workshop alumni members and give them a space to share their unique perspective on what the workshop was for them and how it was impactful in their lives and we're going to transition now to our first round of alumni insight and I'd like to call on our first alumni to be sharing their experience today and that's going to be alethia Hi alethea how are you how are you feeling today Oh no alithia you're still unmute no worries uh click on you there you go you can yep you're all good Olivia hi Alicia as I was saying hello everybody I'm very pleased to be here to share my experience and I want to talk I know there are a lot of people here and I'm thinking about the people that are um doubting you know are considering to join the workshop because it's like it's a difficult thing to do it's investment of money it's investment of time which for me was even more valuable so you probably have seen the information that is on the website about what the workshop contains the all the live sessions and the curriculum you know all the information you're gonna get a lot of knowledge in case you are doubting whether or not that is going to be enough rest assured you will have more than enough rest assured is going to be high quality so let's get out of the way because that's not what matters in my opinion because that's the tangibles that is the thing that is obvious you know and if you are doubting it's not because of that it's because something else the intangibles you know so what are the intangibles my experience with this because I went there for the tangible the knowledge I thought oh I just need knowledge to build my system and then I will be happy even after the end of the story but then I met the community and that was like you know I'm stuck probably just like you are I'm stuck and I'm not able to figure it out for myself and then you get an upgrade on your brain and you connect with this hive mind I was with 200 plus people in the link in your thinking nine Workshop these people they were coming from all over the place in the world but they they were even having backgrounds I didn't know existed you know it was unbelievable and then what happened to me is that I thought I knew what I wanted and it turns out that I didn't I did not even understand what was my problem and they were articulating these things for me it's like there was all this stuff in my head I just couldn't put it out and they were just articulating it in words for me and it was liberating and it was you know it's like what I really got from this was this understanding of who I am where I am in this journey of the linking the I'm sorry the knowledge management system they clarified this for me and when I left it was like you know what I came here because I wanted to have the perfect system and now I got something even better which is the clarity to know that this is a journey and actually I don't need the perfect system anymore I just have this community that is going to help me grow because we're going to do the journey together so that's what I wanted to share with you and I understand that you want to have um you know like you you want to have the the confidence to invest but unfortunately nobody can explain you what the link in your thinking Workshop is you have to find out for yourself so good luck people I hope I will see you there thank you so much Alicia beautiful message again I want to thank you Alicia for being here together here with us our alumni members and our subject matter experts so super grateful if you're just jumping in once again this is the light Workshop alumni insights and expert sessions you get to hear from our alumni members and experts so that you can learn more about the light workshop and learn if it's right for you for the upcoming one we have light workshop 10. and right now we're just going through our first round of alumni insights and that was alithia our second alumni guest speaker is going to be Andrew and Andrew is going to be sharing with us how the light Workshop has provided him a valuable structure and method to meet his writing and creative goals alright Andrew the floor is yours hey Dan hey good afternoon everyone Andrew Marty here so yeah I was in uh cohortate and I came to cohort Aid with a really common problem and and Nick alluded to that in his introduction right my problem so I'll show you here is I was introduced I was interested in too many things but I didn't have a structure to manage the the books and the videos and all the stuff that I consumed and was interested in I had no structure I had no methodology in order to capture what was really important and as a result I didn't have any outputs I really wanted to get better at writing and having outputs so that led me to this Vision that I have of really I want to get serious about being a writer and build a following and hone my craft so how do I get there well I have this goal okay published two posts each week in medium in 2023 104 posts okay it's a lot it's audacious how the heck do I get there there's only only way that I know how to get there and that's having a process and this is where linking your thinking has really provided a great foundation for me to have a process and so here's a overview of that here in the middle right it's built on this concept of collecting connecting and creating and this is how I've taken that process and make it work for me and and it starts with first awareness of all these things that are around me right of taking these books and videos focused on these topics and being aware of topics that resonate with me and then bring them into this process down below right which is really built on obsidian which allows me to collect these ideas connect them to other ideas and revisit these ideas on a regular basis there's so much richness in digging back into an idea that you captured a month or a year ago and bringing that back into your current perspective so this process has really been vital for me and there's a so many tools and techniques that I learned from the workshop that I've applied I'll just give you a little bit of a preview here of a couple of these one of these this is a community plug-in a kanban this is what I use to manage my output so to me I'm not a binary guy I've got multiple things on the stove at one time this kanban helps me manage that helps me work on and see what's what's on deck and help me visualize what I'm also processing I'm also a big fan of the daily note I've got a daily note as a regular Foundation of just capturing my ideas and then I bring these together into a menu of content which is a key part of the workshop here's one on creativity and so really this is just a couple of techniques that I learned and incorporated into my daily process and really it's vital for me to reach that goal of two posts a week with that ban I'll hand it back to you thank you so much Andrew and in the chat you can actually see and uh Keaton if I can please ask for your help send in the chat um the case study link uh that we we just made for Andrew um you can hear more about his experience his transformation story and again I want to appreciate Andrew Marty for making the time being here really appreciate you Andrew for sharing that one too and I hope this is giving you a sense on what it's like when you've taken the workshop together with us and this is what this whole event is all about we're hearing from our alumni and later on we're going to be hearing from our subject matter experts but with that maybe you are also curious you're thinking Hmm how does the workshop actually work what what is included in the workshop well fortunately the the next section that's what we're going to be covering but before that I do want to be highlighting a couple of things and I want to be giving a shout out to a couple of people Shirley is in the chat thank you so much Shirley is saying she joined the link in your thinking community on September 21 and create meaning was the gateway to generating content and being among community of folks with shared shared interest in connecting ideas thank you Shirley and we also have here from John John's comment hey John thank you since Court 3B it's been remarkable to experience Nick's iteration with the lyt curriculum and to make the experience and resources even more valuable that is right the upcoming Workshop is the 10th workshop and so we're really looking forward to seeing you there but with that let's let's learn more how this actually works and I'm gonna pass the mic to Nick Nick can you tell us how the workshop Works what is included when we enroll in the workshop oh sorry Nick you're still on mute there you go oh we're good thank you for unmuting me and uh here let's go to it so Dan if um let's see I'm going to share my screen we can just go ahead and add I have a little walk through and I want to take you through a few things so you should be able to see that on screen now and I'm going to magically resize it there we go and now let's hop into this thing so that's a little bit of a live preview a walk through through the workshop for Workshop 10 I'd like to introduce you to the three steps of Knowledge Management in a previous Workshop this was called in code so we're trying to figure out ways to make it as clear as possible and the idea behind this as you're looking at it is that this is something we can't avoid but we can get better at it and I want to just say no matter what you're doing walking around in the world going to the grocery store whatever it is you have inputs information that's coming your way obviously it's when we're in front of the computer and we're looking or reading about something that's obvious but everywhere we go there are inputs coming in for into us we also say things things come out of our mouth we write things we engage with others we create things those are our outputs so what happens in between this is what we do with Knowledge Management and this doesn't matter if you were born 2000 years ago or if you're working on something today we just do three things we collect some of these inputs and then from that we end up connecting those inputs to something we already know and we mix all that stuff up and we end up creating stuff some of that stuff yes is shared with others but the creative process can also be an internal one if we look at this framework the reason I'm bringing it up now is because I'd like to ask these questions where are you best what are you avoiding and most importantly for our purposes where are you getting stuck one example that's common with anyone who's on this call is that we're getting stuck between collecting stuff and doing something with that stuff way that we can articulate that is to say the problem isn't note taking it's note making and simply put you're probably not doing it because we were never taught how to do it we were taught how to take notes how to make highlights the idea here is that we can reduce our highlights so we can increase our insights and we do that by connecting new ideas to known ideas to ideas that you're already aware of in your life to make this work we can say a simple keyword and that's because so anyways that gives you a taste of where we want to go when you join the workshop you take the planet pecan Planet survey you get results they don't look quite this pretty just yet but the the ideas are you understand what your thinking style how do you approach problems is it from the bottom up or is it from the top down when do you go into a certain style when do you go to the other style until recently technology and folders and frankly the getting things done methodology has forced a top-down structure and that serves a great purpose but it's only half of the picture the other half is when we work from the bottom up when we're working spontaneously organically creatively and being able to bounce between both is truly a superpower there's other stuff here I'll go to the next slide to talk a little bit more about the workshop itself so it runs from January 31st to March 3rd on Tuesdays we have our core sessions 90 minute super sessions where we introduce some Concepts we spend time working with the concept communicating around the concept and then we go on to the next one so these are really valuable and we have question and answer for another 30 minutes on top of that at the end all recordings here are made available immediately almost immediately right afterwards one to two hours and then we have our very popular sense making sessions where your hands are on the keyboard and your head's engaged and you're getting in repetitions active engaged repetitions doing a process called note making what is that all about so that's what we're doing on our sense making sessions and we have four of those right after this session the new online lessons are unlocked I'll go over these in a little bit then we have our expert sessions from Mike Schmitz and then for more sense making sessions for one each week that mirror these ones but these are more to make sure we get Asia Pacific time zones give them a friendlier option and just for people who might not be able to make these ones and then we have our other expert sessions with Sana Lionel and Bianca who where we will hear all more from them and just to give you a little bit more of an inside look we have our live sessions during the workshop the super sessions the sense making sessions and then the ones from the subject matter experts and they do eight during our 33-day Sprint and then there are eight more that are a little bit slower as part of a light Journey a linking or thinking Journey package that you can join the online learning if we want to learn effectively can't be just one way but it can work but if we want to learn best it's through multiple Avenues so in as along with the live sessions you can learn at your own pace through these lessons that complement the live sessions as well as through online interactions as well as exercises with feedback so we create some powerful learning effects and then you will have ongoing access and training so you will no matter what have lifetime access to the lessons and to the recordings from this Workshop so it's pretty wild now here's a quick sneak peek into the back end this is circle if anyone's familiar with that and let's just check out this curriculum now this is part of our linking thinking 10 holding space this is what we're going through now is the unit one you can see that we have our lessons and you can see my cursor over here is taking us through the different lessons and each one has its own section but if you're tied on time what you pay attention to are the stars just want to pay attention to the stars because everyone has a different amount of hours spent when you click into a lesson you can go back one of two ways by clicking the back or the mlc link and then you can go next for the lesson and this is just to give you a taste of kind of what it looks like once you're in and you're going through those 90 lessons that are released weekly and this is another example and hopefully that gives you a sense after a few of these we get into next actions that are make sure that we really cement what we learn so there you have it now we want to continue just so you're aware of what is in the other curriculums we can go down to the curriculum for units 2 and 3. and give a sneak peek into this that's where we're note making and map making growing value and accelerating our ideas this is the meat of linked based Knowledge Management so you can see on screen I'm highlighting the starred notes if you're tight on time just make sure you hit these starred lessons these are the most valuable especially the colliding phase that you could see there for a moment and then that continues onward but that's going to take us to the castle section of the workshop experience and I really want to point you towards the fact that everyone has different levels of available time and it's okay if you have less than four hours or if you have more than 10 hours and so we're going to go into the different Workshop Journeys right now if you only have four hours consider yourself on the appetizer attend my Tuesday super sessions attend the Wednesday sense making session don't worry about the guide sessions don't worry at all about the curriculum and then in the final week attend the Showcase sessions from your your peers your other students as many as you can now let's imagine you had over 10 hours what would that look like attend the super session the sense making sessions attend at least two of the special guide subject matter expert sessions and maybe even a third one and then also you can probably make it through all of the curriculum lessons The Sweet Spot for the workshop is the journey where you can still attend two guide sessions but as far as the curriculum you just attend the start and the reason behind that is because why you have lifetime access to the curriculum so during our 33-day Sprint you want to be wherever everyone else is you want to go where everyone knows your name sorry that just got caught in my head for a little bit little cheers jingle but that is going to be my walkthrough for You of a sense of the curriculum a sense of the community and a sense of the overall experience for a 33-day Sprint and actually even Beyond if you choose the journey package I'm gonna turn it back to you Dan thank you so much Nick thank you for walking us through on what the workshop is all about and that and that part what it's what is included feel free to visit our website linking your thinking.com is the right link and thanks to Keaton he's going to be sharing that link and the QR code thank you Bianca you can scan that QR code right there and here if you're just joining us welcome this is the light Workshop alumni insights and expert sessions and we're just we're just halfway through now and we're we're covering uh you're hearing from us from our light alumni members and also expert sessions in a while and and what are the expert sessions these these sessions will be providing you deep dive deep Dives in their specialized areas with a focus on how they're leveraging their pcam system within their field so you can expect two 60-minute sessions from each of our subject matter experts during the workshop and we're going to be hearing from them uh let's start with Sana Sana how are you doing today I am doing great Dan thanks for the introduction um so I'm very very excited to be a part of light Workshop 10 some of you may know me because of the forest in one of Nick's case study videos if you do not know me I'm a certified brand consultant I'm also a content creator I focus on Twitter LinkedIn and Instagram but I also work with Innovative and thoughtful entrepreneurs who are ready to go all in on their Unique Edge and clarify their personal brand and grow their business with my coaching programs but I've literally did not start that way and I think light had such a huge impact in helping me with my brand the way that I do my content online and how I streamline all of it and also just my presence in general and what I talk about um so in the beginning I was creating content very haphazardly right I had also a huge fear of creating regurgitate regurgitated content like stuff that was already out there something that somebody else had said and I was worried of not adding a unique spin to things so when I got introduced to the light Frameworks and I was a part of cohort 2 it turned my brain on fire and you will probably hear some rendition of that from everybody that you meet in light Workshop 10. so what what actually happened was I was able to streamline my content systems and I was able to find a very unique way to write and create Limitless authentic content um so if you are a Creator and you want to leverage what you're doing in linking your thinking or you want to learn the fundamentals of what the top creators know that you don't know yet I am so excited to help you um in the light Sprint and the light journey by sharing what I know and learning from all of you you might know me might be wondering uh why I have half my face or I'm not totally online I consider myself semi-faceless that's how I position my personal brand and I'm really looking forward to seeing how you guys position yourself or how you think through that but if you are looking to relate to me a little bit more I am a book nerd like a lot of you and I'm also an autodidact like all of you I'm back over to you Dan wow thank you thank you Sana for joining us for Workshop 10. Sunday is a good friend so I hearing from Sana again it's it's it's just super grateful for for your presence once again Sana and for everyone here also in the chat I'm just smiling I'm receiving emails and in the chat uh from our alumni members sharing their support and love and you know two years ago uh two and a half years ago Nick and I were just starting this out I'm from cohort one um and it's it's been an amazing journey a real real quick Nick if you you guys check out the one of the first articles that Nick wrote on medium it's called mypkm story and right there he shared you know um the vision of reaching out to a thousand students and I want to share with you Nick today I think we've we've reached a good milestone in reaching that right there so yay this is this I I feel this is also a celebration for for the link in your thinking community and for all of us moving forward and and for you guys who are considering and taking the workshop well this event is just for you and if you do have questions for us something is not clear please feel free to ask that in the chat because later on we're going to have our q a and you can ask questions to our alumni speakers to some of our subject matter experts and talking about subject matter experts we do have two uh three more subject matter experts but um two of them couldn't make it here because of their schedule but that's totally okay we did ask them if they can uh record themselves and in the next uh two that we're going to be listening from we're going to be hearing their video and see how that goes and so for the next one we are going to be hearing from Lionel devoust Lionel is a best-selling and award-winning writer and he can tell you more uh what what he's going to be teaching in the upcoming workshop and I'm going to ask Bianca to play that video right now Bianca can you please play that video hello everyone I'm Lionel Davis I'm sorry I can't be here with you guys I'm currently in Australia so it's the middle of the night here but I'm very happy to be uh talking in the workshop to come I'm a professional fiction writer from France as you might guess for my outrageous accent I write Science Fiction and Fantasy I've published around 15 books 35 short stories all professionally uh working especially on big huge fantasy sagas I've also been doing a lot of translations some editorial work and generally speaking I am very interested in ways to streamline the writing and storytelling process because I believe it's hot enough as it is if we can make the job easier and more pleasurable I'm always all for it what I'm going to be talking in my expert sessions I am going to talk about uh story emergence the productivity models uh GTD and the like are all well and good when it comes to clear projects uh things that are that have a very clear beginning a middle or an end but uh creativity is a lot more as I just said chaotic and messy and you need to basically reconfigure your ideas and your preconceptions about what are you doing all the time the fluid Frameworks and licking your thinking leans itself very well to that I will be talking about how linked thinking can support creative emergence especially in the context of Storytelling and fiction writing I'm very happy very excited to be part of the workshop I really enjoyed the and I still do the atmosphere and all the Good Vibes that we can find on the forums and in the cohorts when I started this this career some 20 years ago now in writing and Publishing one of my mentors told me in those jobs you can never pay back to the people that have helped you along because they're pretty much always more experienced than you are what you can do is you can try and lift the people that come after you up very humbly I hope I can contribute a little to that as she told me you can never pay back you can only pay forward and that's what I hope I will be bringing to you guys so I'm looking forward to talk to you and exchange and submit myself to all questions that you might have looking forward to it see you in the workshop and there you go thank you Lionel if you're watching this uh let's say hi to Lino thank you Lionel uh in case you you you know you haven't heard this is very interesting for me Nick was sharing this with me behind the scenes when we were preparing for the workshop Lino's work has been hailed as the French Game of Thrones so there you go if you are curious in developing your PKM as a writer we have subject matter experts right here a Lionel devoose will be guiding you in that um and then right now we're just we're gonna be we're we're having this session so I hope you're feeling good I hope all is well wherever you are and we want to appreciate you for being here once again if you do have a question about the workshop please feel free to ask but then if you are ready to join join us for the upcoming session the website that you're looking at is linkingyourthinking.com right there so with that we want to hear from our next subject matter expert and that's going to be Mike Schmitz he's going to be focusing on digital journaling and better book notes so Bianca please hey everyone this is Mike Schmitz I am the creator of faith-based productivity I'm a YouTuber and I co-host a couple podcasts The Bookworm podcast with Joe billig the focus podcast with David Sparks and the intentional Family podcast with my wife and I have been a fan of linking your thinking for a long time I think I first joined uh cohort seven if memory serves right and I learned a lot going through the the process and so I am very excited to be able to contribute to this upcoming Workshop here and uh I would just encourage you you know you're going to get out of it what you put into it and I'm excited to have a part in kind of guiding you along the your sense making Journey a couple of my sessions are going to be around specifically making sense of all the information that's around us and really what does it mean to me in the areas of taking better book notes I read a lot of books for The Bookworm podcast that I do and I noticed that there's a lot of ideas that repeat themselves over and over again and every time you read it in a different book you get a little bit different glimpse of the information well when you combine that with the idea that there's so much information out there and really everything that we've built our reality on is one tiny sliver of what is actually knowable it just kind of opens up your eyes to all of these things that we have yet to learn and so when you have a tool that helps you make sense of all that stuff and see how all the pieces fit together using syntopical reading and idea from Mortimer Adler and how to read a book it can be really really powerful and then likewise I really believe in personal growth self-development and working harder on yourself than you do on your job and so journaling is a big a big tool that I like to use but for a long time I've done it and I just answered all the prompts and I would get discouraged about all the things that I wanted to do and didn't actually do you know and when you're thinking about the Quantified Self idea there's just so much that you can pay attention to and again the clarifying question has to be what does this really mean for me so over the years I've kind of dialed it in and developed a journaling workflow that I'm I'm excited to share with you all and hopefully give you some ideas about how you can use journaling to inspire growth yourself and become the best version of yourself so very excited to be a part of this this workshop and looking forward to working with you all here in Workshop number 10. it's going to be a great couple of weeks and looking forward to what you're able to produce what you're able to make sense of as you link your you your thinking and you connect the dots and of your own ideas and make the most of the information that's around you so excited to be a part of it and we are really excited to be attending your session to Mike thank you to thank you again Mike for being here with us for the upcoming workshop and for that video up next we do have our one of our team members here at the light team with the light team Bianca Pereira she is going to be focusing on Research mindsets and workflows so to learn more about that let's hear more from Bianca Bianca please take it away thanks a lot then and so welcome to this event today I really happy to see uh so many people live here and my focus as Dan said is in research I work for a mindset okay because most of the time as researchers you say well I take a note so I don't have a problem and take notes I have actually too many notes I have posted I have notebooks I have something digital I have those nice literature reviews in the Excel spreadsheet right that's what we use all the time but then when it comes to actually writing a research paper we always start for a blank page okay so always starting almost if we haven't done all the work almost if we didn't already know everything okay that we have studied and we have put together to create that paper or that thesis at the end of The Journey so what I like to say and and then The Next Step what we do we say well what is the tool that can help me maybe my spreadsheet I should use notion now or maybe I should use obsidian or Scranton or whatever is the new tool and I also I always like to invite everyone to actually give one step back let's think about the mindsets okay what how what are the types of thinking that we want to support so then we can think how we can support that way of thinking so during those uh those guided sessions during the light Workshop the during the linking or thinking Workshop during this print we'll be focusing on how can we get to read of our perfectionism which is very common in Academia for and for researchers outside of Academia as well how we can free ourselves to actually express our thoughts and then when it's time to write we have our thoughts expressed and also how we can learn from others how we can process the literature how we can reference the literature in our notes those are the two sessions for those who wants to go through this print and for those who are here for the long journey like I am as I say in the beginning I'm here for two years already and always learning always getting more and more from Nick and from the community for that journey I actually want you to choose what you would like to learn more about is it how to grow their knowledge how to make sense of the of the ideas that you already have collected you already Express it is it still write an output from your node is it to thinking about a conceptual framework so the idea of the the sessions that they are very tailored to the people in the sessions okay so there are many things that we can talk about research so the two first ones are really the introductions so how we can free yourself to take notes for research and then the last two ones okay where do we want to go now where we want to go together in this journey so that's a little bit of what we'll be talking about in the expert sessions about academic workflows and research mindsets so if that I pass it back to you then thank you so much Bianca and you are so awesome Bianca thank you for taking care of the layouts right there last year on the same day I think right wow look at that time so fast same day I was handling this speaking and then at the same time to lay out stuff man so thank you so much I'm so grateful with all the support that we have here from our alumni members our subject matter experts and with you being here attending knowing more about the light Workshop we're going to be having the Q a in a little while and so if you do have a question or two please feel free to ask in the chat right there we we're going to answer your question if you have a specific question to one of our alumni guests please feel free to do so I I want to point out someone message me this privately I'll show that again and I'll just read it a little bit this person said it would be fun to hear more from people how completing the course or adopting the system helped them achieve or do XYZ so more of like how how did they benefit from the workshop fortunately this is the event for you the alumni insights and our next part in the program is we're going to be doing the second round of alumni in sight and we have three alumni speakers here with us that's going to be Karen bragat and Avril and so we're going to be hearing from them so the first one is we're going to be hearing from Karen hi Karen how are you doing today hi Dan I'm doing great thank you uh so my um use of my PKM is NYX I think it was number four it's the one about your inner life and about um it directing your life and making a difference and so it won't surprise you that I'm going to do my thing as a story it's a true story it's from when I was 10 years old I decided I wanted to learn how to swim and so I went to the library and I got a book about swimming uh and I took it to a friend's Cottage and we propped it on the dock and we followed the steps and I came away from that experience with a really bad sunstroke and the ability to float in seven different ways what I couldn't do then and still can't very well is actually swim but that didn't affect my belief for a long long time that learning was something that I Do by myself with books and I think of that now as sort of the school-based version of learning it lasted uh you know right through probably through a lot of my post-grad work unfortunately and I have spared no expense and put considerable artistic effort into showing you a model of what that school-based learning looks like it really is a straight line there's a beginning there's an end and at the end there's usually a test or a thesis or a paper of some kind so that was the conception for a long time and then and then I became a teacher I taught adolescence and ultimately I ended up teaching teachers and I at that point donned the mantle of the expert I was the one writing the book about adult learning and how to facilitate learning and how to enrich it and the good news is learning took on a lot more Nuance for me at that point I recognized um that it was that it was cyclical I recognized the need for it to take into account the whole person and so I I wrote about I specialized in differentiating my instruction for Learners and so the the learner model changed it became another artistic wonder it became a circle the universal symbol of completion and of wholeness of unity um so great and then I saw one of Nick's videos on YouTube I fell across it I have no idea why but I found one of Nick's videos and it was really captivating but remember I'm somebody who is a specialist in learning I know how to do this why do I need an expensive program I can just read a lot of books I already know how to take notes well I'm here to tell you that just as Nick said there is a world of difference between taking a note and making a note and there's also a real problem when you have a lot of notes and you don't have any way to frame those you don't have any way to put them together and see all those wonderful connections so in my journals there's Insight after Insight after Insight but it got so mixed up amongst other people's words and I have no way to retrieve those or I had no way to retrieve those so it was kind of like living Groundhog Day the same experience over and over and over again um the same Insight occurring as if it were brand new so lot changed that for me they helped me with all of those things they helped me with with that but they did something so much more important than that what linking your thinking has done is given me a a different model of learning it's allowed me to transcend old beliefs and old patterns and old structures for the sake of new connections and new ideas and new interpretations and so the model for that is a model that supports what I want more than anything in my life which is to live a creative life what Elizabeth Gilbert in her book big magic called an amplified life and an amplified life is a life that recognizes that although there's a lot of Chaos in turmoil in the world today there's also an enormous amount of Wonder and beauty and as a novelist from the last century wrote when knowledge increases wonder deepens and that's what I want I want a deepening of the Wonder so the the learning model that comes with that is the spiral and this is a model where you are going through the loops you're doing things multiple times you're making the same mistakes multiple times but every time you're in a new place you're moving you're moving deeper you're moving closer to the center whatever that Center is for you and so linking your thinking for me has given me my creative life it's given me my Learning Journey and it's given me my people it's an incredible team and an incredible Community where things are communicated in a myriad of brilliant ways but if I had to say one thing that really has made a huge difference to me is that linking your thinking provides us with guidelines not guide dogs we are given some frames and some structures that that the team and the entire Community then helps us make our own to do what it is we want to achieve that's a creative Life That's A Creative Learning Journey and I am incredibly grateful um to the team and to the community uh for for this experience thanks back to you Dan wow Karen that was a beautiful message can we give a big round of applause if you're here virtually show some show some love and support thank you Karen and for everyone being here man I am I'm so glad to be here and I hope you are finding you know this all worth it for you you're watching having a good time again this is the light Workshop alumni insights expert session you'll hear from RX alumni and experts and so you get to learn more about the linking your thinking Workshop what is it all about is it right for you and what was the experience like for for our graduates and so we are at our second round of alumni insight and that was Karen thank you so much once again Karen Keaton if you can find that case study page that we we've made for for Karen I think a couple of people will find that very interesting and very helpful so please feel free to check in the chat and again uh if you do have a question please I'm encouraging you feel free to ask there are no stupid questions um anything that's not clear we want to make it clear for you so that you can be more informed and know that this Workshop is is right for you okay moving forward our next alumni speaker is going to be pragat hey bragat how are you doing man all right we got click the mute button so that you can unmute button no worries there you go what are you doing everyone thanks to sitting fight invitation to be here with you I prepare some slides to to share just four of them if we could share them great I will be very synthetic I am using obsidian with the light instructions and techniques and good tips a long two years now I am from light 3B when they have letters yeah and there and I keep writing and give me conscious consistency every day and that's the size of my twins when I start writing that's a note from yesterday and the wife for the Light Community it's like every y for different places that you like it's about the people and start with us and they give me the methods and more than that give instructions and share thoughts about how to be consistent with ourselves and the why it's the people it's Dan it's Bianca it's Nick it's kitten it's everyone that makes it all a joy in the Pro process more than that and answering the parts from our colleagues here in YouTube it's my favorite part in the workshops is when I started creating something new that I don't know and then it's inside the light and others are liking about it and using so home notes everything it's a home and you could make your home warm and better to you so our notes mocs everything could be like that and my favorite part of the workshop it's about making my home notes Myspace better and this gives me New Opportunities now because I am far from my family in the moment because I wrote my thesis inside the the obsidian with the light techniques and a lot of meetings with guys and pick up in different tips and putting effort in this and then I have a KD and I wrote a project and then I have a work remote remotely and now I have a different work in different states in Brazil and I am doing a lot of research about health and giving interviews and helping with what I love to do and every day I give I make documentation about it and then share with people that I like in the work but the most viable part of this is this connections because now I am far away from my twins they are bigger now but every night I call to them and I have notes to telling different stories so is this all about Connections and to finish this I would say that far away now to be better tomorrow and this is about my family but it's about the connections that we will do in your notes far away now better to get to together tomorrow that's it big round of applause ladies and gentlemen that's where God for God is a good friend pragat I appreciate you so much man thank you for sharing and being here with us it's been a while since I met Regatta so this is the first time for many of us to be here so again super grateful and I want I'm very curious Nick do you have a comment on that so far yeah I mean I have so many comments from everyone's I'll just touch on brigots wow I didn't realize to what level that you had taken it and definitely want to hear more about that research paper another time um but just really impressive and again I want to go down the line but we'll keep this thing moving um and I'll turn it back to you Dan thanks Nick and thank you again ragat and for everyone being here this is the light Workshop alumni insights and expert sessions where you get to hear from our alumni members and our experts so if you are thinking about enrolling or learning more there is a magical link right there in the chat linking yourthinking.com and we're going to be having opening up the Q a in a while so please feel free to write your questions if you haven't please feel free to ask any question to either Nick or to our alumni guest right here this is your chance to to to have that answer right there up next we have one more linkier thinking alumni member and Avril Avril is going to be sharing how linking your thinking helped her break free from completionist thinking and achieve more very interesting Avril how are you doing today hey hey Dan thanks so much I'm really excited to be here and to just share my experience and journey um and before I share my screen I did want to touch a little bit of you know how did I how did I even get adding to a light community so I'm a designer I've been creating things for like 15 years or so so creating process it's not new to me but last year March uh during my birthday I was like you know what it's about time to do something different so I made a two big goals for myself one is I want to build my online presence that is public uh to everyone in addition to my day job of course and the second thing is I want to also move to California San Francisco this year may and so those are like two gigantic like goals for myself um and what that means is you know there's a lot of things I need to figure it out uh what am I gonna write what platform I'm gonna use what topic am I gonna do and what is my writing process because it's zero starting from zero for both and so um at the time you know that's where I would start googling hey is there anything can help me achieve more so I accidentally uh stumbled from um the light uh conference I think that was last year may and well I look at the workshop first and you know at the time I look at the price and knowing that I'm gonna move to California it's gonna cost me quite a lot so I was like you know what let me check it out to see what that means and so I went to the free events the conference the first one is in May the second one is I think in September both are so great but it's just I wait till September that's where I was like you know what I think I'm gonna invest in this and so now I'm gonna share my screen to show you just since October to now what did I accomplish just by applying the learning um so the one key takeaway I learned really shocked me in the workshop is this line this question of how many um all of us we take a lot of notes and um you know save a lot of information but how many percentage of that is you're reading on someone else piece and how many percentage of that is you made for yourself and so when you're writing on someone else piece that means you know you're synthesizing the article you're synthesizing a book what is this book about but you're still talking about other people's work and so when I look back um to my uh creation process in the in the past 15 years this is what I usually do okay I have a big goal two goals I'm gonna figure things out so I'm gonna block my calendar two weeks in a row try to tackle everything let's say if I need to figure out what platform it is I'm gonna go into that and figure things out and then after that two weeks of time block I'll produce one Lego okay I'm gonna pick certain platform for example but at the same time I'm gonna be burned out exhausted and that's how the graph is uh going um um and so the previous uh 15 years the creation process is I have this mindset of you know everything needs to be finished so I can produce something I need to finish an article I need to finish reading the book I need to finish reading something I need to get a hundred percent of this thing I'm trying to make then I can produce something but then every time you can see just by consuming all this information I spend eighty percent of my time just on other people's stuff only 20 is actually producing things and then another again this is me lying door and then just in the floor and just just exhausted and through the lights Workshop what I learned is the system is really fluid and it really empowers me to do fluid thinking and so now I actually adopt the new mindset that certain things can be only one percent finish and certain things cannot be only five percent finished but then I'm already creating uh more stuff and so that's kind of a graphs I draw really quick this morning just to Showcase how my thought process and creation process evolved and just to show a little bit like in my note-taking system what does that mean fully system what does that mean you actually do more in moving a lot of pieces um at the same time forward um in parallel so this I took a screenshot of a note I had in uh January 18th I think is it last Wednesday or something anyway it's a weekday and so this is the stuff I've been working on throughout the day and I'm still working during the work hours ago five and so you can see other people's work only reduce to 20 percent and the rest it's all my stuff green part is my writing the orange part in yellow part is either my learning or my life piece and so you can see you even see my notes about hey certain box I only pack half of that I didn't even finish but I just label hey this is a book box and so I mixed that with the like stickies on the box and I can just flip my phone and search all those information seriously like if I'm going to do those two big goals at the same time still working uh during the daytime it's going to be super stressful but then the results is I don't want to show the results right after uh line nine um I applied the learning and I gave a speaker event um and all the content was produced actually during the same time when I was learning the line nine and I did this and it was tremendous um feedback coming back and I got because of that I actually got a lot of invitation for this year so now I want to show you you know after 64 days what does that look like just 60 60 40 not not even a year this is the piece I'm working on right now and just last week uh Friday in fact I I was able to got a um invitation lockdown for a speaker event in a conference in Florida and what I did is I pull up my random notes on the side when I'm on Zoom meeting with the facilitator and I talk over the ideas I show up over here that this is something I've been talking about working on and then we exchange those and then she thinks okay you're a great speaker let's go and so that's kind of um the results um it gives to me and at the same time those are the complicated topics I'm making sense I'm not an engineer so in order for me to understand each of those Concepts I always have an eager you know I really want to figure things out 100 to get it right but now with a new mindset each of them I just learned a little bit but I will have my own unique perspective and I take that piece and create things immediately so that's kind of um the learning and at the same time of course I'm my moving is on track so um that's uh all I want to share I hope that can um kind of just provide a little bit um kind of thoughts for everyone is considering um the workshop and I talked about it's only 64 days to be honest after seeing those I was talking with my friend last Friday I was like hey this is too good to be true and you know if this is the case I wish I could have take this a little bit sooner because can you imagine 64 days I have this what if it's a year and what kind of result would that be and so yeah happy to share this with all of you so I'm gonna give it back to Dan Avril the hair of my skin is standing anything that you're saying is just resonating a lot and I'm just like wow you know I'm the guy behind us the the emails I'm reading a lot of good emails happy emails and a couple of support emails too so thank you so much Avril for for sharing that I think that was important for people to hear and see what is it like you know the transformation right like what are you getting out of this this workshop and so at this moment I do want to say again thank you to all of our alumni members here with us we have right here Karen Shirley Avril Andrew ragat alethia thank you so much and everyone in the chat thank you so much if you're just tuning in this is the light Workshop alumni insights and expert sessions in a few moments we're going to be transitioning into Q and A so your questions will be answered in the chat feel free to type your question and we'll be taking care of those in a while but before we transition to to the Q a I do want to highlight that what Avril was pointing out what our alumni members are pointing out is that linking your thinking it's not just a one-time thing like you take it once and then that's it this is now why we have what we call the lyt journey if you go to the website linking your thinking.com you'll be able to see what that means and what it's all about and at this moment I do want to turn it back to Nick and ask the question Nick why should people join now why should they take the light Journey first how to unmute myself um yeah well I I mean I have things I could say but I think everyone here has already said like why you need to take it from multiple perspectives um mine you've probably heard from here or there but you can tell how this can accelerate your inner life or your external life and likely it's going to be a mixture of both and you can do it in a sustainable and future-proof way you don't have to always be searching for a different system you can actually figure out where those systems have failed you in the past because of the community support all these different people coming in with their own unique issues and and use cases you learn from them and it's like wow how come I've never had a support team for the most one of the most important things you know there's breathing um but then there's interacting with knowledge around us I mean it's pretty high up on the list how come we don't talk to other people about how we do this and then this is a place to accomplish that and you'll leave with that custom future proof PKM system to power whatever it is you are trying to do that's all I have I'm looking at the time so I don't think we'll go into questions that long mainly because I just want to make sure that we respect everybody's time we're already over but if there are a few we can we can hit a few real fast Dan but then we just want to make sure we don't go too long so we can get everyone on their way too you're absolutely right Nick but thank you for sharing that Insight with us that is really good to know good to hear from you too Nick we do have a I think we do have a couple of questions but before we transition right there I want to confirm with keita and Keaton is there any question that that's standing out for you that needs that can be answered live here today yes we've got a question from Greg here are the sessions once on Tuesday and then twice on Wednesday or do you choose um one of the Wednesday sessions and Nick if you'd like to tackle it otherwise I should yeah um I can tackle that one and I'll take us back to that screenshot oh 30 on screen that was fast um so what we have here is there's one session on Tuesday that's the main time that time is 9 00 a.m Pacific time that's Los Angeles time um and then that goes for 90 minutes with an extra 30 seconds of question and answer as you can see here every recording is made available one to two hours after the session now regarding the sense making sessions on Wednesday these are a repeat session so it's not recorded though so it's live Anything Can Happen live um it's it's just it's always a different experience there are different inputs because we're so Hands-On it really has a completely different feel but just letting you know we will cover the same material the same exercises uh in the morning my time and then in the afternoon my time so if you only attended one that's fine if you really just want to get those repetitions then you could certainly attend it a second time all right thank you thank you for the answer and thank you for the question Greg Keaton is there anything else that's standing out for you that we can answer live right now so um one there's one other question right here that from Robin that she would love to hear from alumni who have gone through multiple workshops and what the extra learnings have been I think also you you've seen it in the chat the things compound along the way as we continue to return nearly everybody on stage right now has actually gone through multiple alethea is returning again for Workshop uh 10 along the way two for these same the compounding opportunities would anyone like to just briefly say one or two statements about the way that returning for a second Workshop has impacted between the ones on stage right now so uh Keaton yeah really quick uh for me what's really helpful is so many great Concepts and uh so the first Workshop I went through you know you're really I was really wrapping my head around some of these Concepts the second one is a great reinforcement of these ideas and a chance to expand a little bit further and maybe dig deeper into a topic that was skimmed across in the first one so the reinforcement for me was a key benefit thanks a lot Andrew Well Karen did you want to say something real quick too and then we'll pivot to the next one yep just really quick um I was surprised in the second Workshop that I attended that the content had already been enriched and changed from the first Workshop I attended I expected it to be a repeat of the material a direct repeat of the material that wasn't the case at all so while the concept stayed consistent it's always evolving and the other thing that's always evolving at least for me is my personal use of the material so I'm also looking at it in a through a different lens uh or with different kinds of questions so it feels like a really fresh experience it's it's well worth multiple times well said Karen yes the both it compounds both in the iterations of the workshop and also their different place along your personal PKM Journey so with that I will hand things back to Dan Dan how are you doing I'm doing good I'm just very happy and I'm also looking at the time I hope everyone is having a good time having a great time uh Nick and everyone else man this is amazing um we're gonna be closing in a little while but I'll just answer a couple of questions that were sent to the hello at linking your thinking email and by the way that is the email to go to if you have additional questions that we can't answer anymore right here live but we would we'd be super happy to entertain you give you Clarity answer so there is the email hello at linearthinking.com so the question is um can I how do I pay via PayPal so yeah just send us an email and we'll create a custom invoice for you um the next question is do you offer scholarships uh do you have a scholarship program yes in the chat um Keaton will be sharing that link um the scholarship application will be closing very soon so check that out and then payment plans any payment plans that are you that you're offering yes we do have payment plans available if you click in enroll now in our website linking your thinking.com you'll be able to see the two pricing cards and at the bottom of the buttons there's going to be that payment link right there okay I think that's all the questions that I have for today I'm reading a couple of uh comments right here and I think I saw one from what is that this is personally I was seeing all right I just want to give a big shout out to everyone who's been here with us and Javier is saying thank you all very much for sharing your experiences very inspiring for me yes it is for me I'm taking I'm writing down notes as well and uh checking like if everyone's

speaker and that's going to be Bianca Pereira Bianca uh Bianca we were just chatting the other day and you were telling me you know you know how the light Journey name really resonates with you can you can you speak more to that about that one yeah thanks Dan uh one of the things that I was saying like when you come uh for the first time yeah you have everything is new but then the more I have been for two years here already so the more time we spend with the light Workshop the more we learn the more we get out of it because the community is growing there are people with completely different experiences so we are always learning from each other so the idea of the light Journal is like you come you get the ideas but then it's really a journey where we the more time we spend with linking or thinking Workshop the more we learn the more you grow from it so that's that's my thing so if you're if you're things like Sprint maybe you want to reconsider because really it's really personal Knowledge Management is really a journey that you you learn and improve and you grow over time I think Bianca thank you so much for your message and let's give everyone a big round of handshakes Good Vibes a round of applause if you're watching virtually if you're watching posts you know make a comment like the video share the video ask us a question that would be very helpful for

the only thing I want to say before you close there Dan is just um this is a great reminder of how lucky we are to have this online community for anyone who's not a part of a community like this it's just good to know they actually exist where you don't have to be on guard where you don't have to um feel like you're being challenged all the time in in this aggressive way but that you can actually um be stimulated intellectually and learn from each other in a warm environment from other people who are are like that as well and and then just to turn it back to everyone who took their time who's
