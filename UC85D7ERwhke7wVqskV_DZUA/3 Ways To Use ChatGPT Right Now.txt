welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system hi oh it's just more that everything just feels disorganized that's all you mind up your hard drive okay [Music] really weird you'll get used to it everyone's talking about a new chat bot called chat GPT I don't know if you've used this chat box but it is insane it's a beta it's incomplete software but it's already amazing and it's very useful right now in this fast video I'll show you three ways that you can use it not just to think for you but to help you think better hi I'm Nick Milo and I'm here to help you do your best thinking more often why so you can make meaningful stuff that you're actually proud to put your name on all right let's go first if you don't have chat GPT head down to the show notes and follow the directions to get it what is chat GPT it is an AI chat bot you ask it questions it answers them it can translate into all languages it knows all coding languages it can even generate rhyming poetry it's kind of like Siri but I didn't get that could you try again it works and here's how I'm already using it [Music] foreign split your screen put your text editor for me that's obsidian on the right and chat GPT on the left or arrange your windows however you'd like but you want chat GPT right there writing shotgun with you and I suspect this will be a common way for us to work in the future with the trusty AI chat bot by our side now the main thing chat GPT can do for you is to be your little research assistant now I know what you're thinking well isn't that what Google's for yeah it works fine but chat GPT is already better it's often quicker and easier because it does a bit of the tedious work for you now let me explain I wanted to know the story of Don Quixote so here's the search engine way off to Google I go search for Don Quixote then I have to decide what I want to read out of that whole list now often Wikipedia is a good choice but that's job number one you have to decide what to read then I have to read it and figure out its meaning that's job number two and what you get on Wikipedia varies a lot sometimes you can just read the first paragraph other times like this you've got to go deeper into the article at this point I could go back to Google and read a different article in which case I've wasted time with the first article and now I'm just rolling the dice that the next article will be better with chat GPT these two jobs they're gone I just ask it to tell me the story of Don Quixote and I got this paragraph and that's all I need with a single question I got what I wanted AI like chat GPT can help inform you [Music] next up I want to know which character came first is it Don Quixote or Shakespeare's character Hamlet now this task is a little different from the first one job number one I need to Google Don Quixote and find out when it was written job number two I need to Google Hamlet and figure out when it was written then I can decide which one came first now instead of this bit of boring legwork I asked chat GPT which came first and it just told me done and then I can copy and paste from here and then I'll throw that into my note on Don Quixote so actually let me take off the Privacy glasses and then with this question whose greatest work came first and then paste it right here and it's as easy as doing a little bit of magic and then right away we know that guess who wrote this chat GPT we have a question and an answer it's beautiful and it's part of my note on Don Quixote that can grow with me and connect to other ideas as I keep thinking and creating works that are meaningful to me now if you're curious how I made this little box I cover call outs and obsidian flight school 2.0 when to use them and best practices for making them an effortless part of your thinking process now they are that for me they finally clicked and now I can really use these to allow other people's thoughts in this case other Bots thoughts stand out from my own thoughts now compare this to your Google results Google can't do logic it can't make any sort of assessment even something as simple as this which story came first AI like chat GPT can do research for you but that's not even my favorite reason for using chat GPT but quick one if you want deeper dives into how you can leverage AI to help you think better and create more meaningful work make sure to sign up for my newsletter below now on to my favorite point [Music] it gets even better chat GPT helps you think better you have to use it to fully feel what I mean but it helps you think more clearly about what you are trying to communicate it forces you to be inactive engaged thinker why because you have to ask the right questions for example let's go back after I asked about the story of Don Quixote I got a response from earlier and I realized I cared less about the plot I wanted to know why I should care about Don Quixote in the first place so I type that in and this is what we got and then if I want to keep it in my note on Don Quixote I can just go ahead paste it in here put it into a little call out box so I know it came from my trusty Astro Mac Droid chat GPT and this this is the good stuff this is why two years ago I chose to start Don Quixote and why after just finishing it I'm so glad that I did AI like chat GPT can actually help you think better big big big huge warning chat GPT is not yet trustworthy I cannot overstate this it will tell you things that are false this is a known issue so be careful but in many cases like in these examples I already know some of the basics I really just want confirmation and a bit of extra detail and what I got back here is consistent with what I already know these answers are good enough again AIS are notorious for making stuff up if you ask chat GPT anything high stakes be sure to confirm it to recap AI like chat GPT is already extremely useful and there is no reason not to be using it right now it can inform you it can do research for you and surprisingly it can help you think better those are three ways chat GPT is proving useful for me right now and I have way more to share in the coming months it's AI Mania out there right now and these AIS are popping up in many of the apps you already know and love wherever you are doing your thinking I guarantee you AI is probably headed there next but now I'm curious how are you using AI in your workflow share your ideas in the comments below I would love to learn and hear from you and until next time stay connected foreign
