have you ever tried to copy text out of microsoft word or evernote or even email and it comes out as a bunch of unusable gobbly goop have you ever tried a shiny new writing app for maybe a couple weeks or a month thinking you'll use it forever but then a couple months later you know that you're not and then your writing is kind of stuck there and you have trouble getting it out writing in markdown solves this problem it might look intimidating with hash and asterisk symbols but i promise you there are only six keys that you need to know to be writing like a pro with the confidence that your best ideas are not trapped in somebody else's program let's dive in okay so let's begin first thing i'm going to do is hit that button the new note button and this creates a new note we can title at the top i'm going to paste in the six most important keys to typing in markdown i'll paste it again in here now i know what you're thinking it's just bold or italic right well no maybe in traditional text editing in word we would think bold and we would think italic but in personal knowledge management we need to think how to connect ideas we need to think about how to link your thinking with that in mind we've already discovered the most important part of markdown which is the link and that's where we hit bracket bracket and then all of a sudden we have this list of our notes you know programs like obsidian are really smart so if i type no these are the notes that remain and if i hit s there's an s in note star then i just have to hit enter boom now we have that link that's pretty wild right what's cool about this if we go back to graph view we now see the six most important keys to typing a markdown connected to note star right that should look familiar by now so let's go back to this that is the link super powerful the thing about the link is it is a strong direct connection but that's not the only type of relationship that we can build between ideas and not the only type that we want to make the other one and number two when dealing with markdown is the tag so good example this is i'm looking at my note library and i see a couple concepts in here so let's let's try using the tag let's use at the hashtag concept okay and i see the adversity paradox and i'm just going to at the bottom just put in concept and look it already auto-completed for me and i also want to put in concept to red pill blue pill so at the bottom i'm just going to and hit c and enter now we have that so how does this work so if i command click on concept we get to search we'll cover this in detail in the next video but you can see right away that those three notes give me the results because they have the tag concept in them we can do all sorts of things with these results but the most important thing to know right now is that's how tags work okay now we've covered the link we've covered tags now let's get into how to make our text look a little bit prettier and let's start with italics so now we're getting into this aspect and so what happens is italics typically you want to emphasize something so as you're typing and you want to emphasize something [Music] you add asterisks and there you have it so we can see that we have italics in this section how did that happen markdown reads these asterisks to single asterisks like that to give you um italics now let's take that to the next level the number four most important key to working a markdown you got it it's bold so how do we do this so bold is typically like typically i will use this when i want to bring attention to big nouns and what do we do to get bold in this case double asterisks on both sides and that gives us big nouns excellent now we're almost there now we're going to get into the formatting and cover lists so we've been making a list now what's that look like if i hit dash hyphen and and space then i've created a list and what i'm going to do now is delete so then i can enter and software like obsidian is smart enough to know that a list has began so now when i do this i'm starting to make my list and it's naturally forming so now we have formed a really cool list and that's how it's done and the sixth and final thing that we want to do to get a handle on markdown is to understand how to use headers so let's go through the notes and explore this a little bit it's actually hashtag but then you hit a spacebar this gives us that title and there are six levels of this so let's explore in some of these other notes adversity paradox i usually like to have that here so i'm going to hit hashtag and then adversity paradox doesn't that look pretty nice already and let's imagine um we wanted to hit related here and make this something new so we hit three hashtags and look at that it's smaller it's a header three header levels go from one all the way down to six let's see other examples as we're printing upper notes this is the never note um kind of redundant but we put it right there same thing with note star [Music] see how quickly this can go after a while i'm going to paste what i'm doing is i hit the hashtag and boom i'm pasting in the title related okay so you remember how i did that previously this time i want related to be the header three so now we have something that looks pretty nice and sure i could go header four i could go five and six and we see that they're kind of all the same size of that point this is two this takes us back to header one which is the title but i think three is kind of a nice sub header in this position the matrix we didn't put in so you can see how fast you can start to format your text now remember you don't want to stay focused on this but it doesn't hurt victor frankl you know i might add what's a what's a perfect tag for a person you know it'd be the people tag so i'm coming back through these notes i'm trying to make them pretty you know here i might put in movie i would um this i'm going to put in pkm do you need to put these tags not necessarily but you see how easy it is as you're going in and out of your personal knowledge management library you can simply add a couple things here and there and just incrementally improve your ideas and the beauty that we'll touch on later is that when you get these touches what you're really doing is you're getting reps you're getting repetitions and every rep that you get does something up here it allows those neurons to connect a little bit easier a little bit more efficiently and that's what allows us to remember and recall even better so yeah we just go through and we kind of improve the notes as we go what's note star for the sake of it we'll just say that note star is under the people tag and now that i have a few i can click this one and see that we have never note note star and victor frankl so that's another way that we can kind of use those weak relationship builders tags to our benefit now this is one list and finally we're going to change these up which is a tiny bit of formatting but you can see that this is an auto numbering list as well so this is another form of the same thing and here we have it these six most important keys to typing and markdown the final note i want to make on this that's really important is there's no formatting bar at the top why is that it's because for text that we create the most important thing is the idea that we have that we want to get on page that we can externalize that we can articulate that we can put into a place that we can then return to and grow so formatting is out of the way and we can focus on the most important value creating activity which is actually thinking writing out those ideas and expanding those thoughts i hope you found this video useful see markdown really isn't that intimidating if you have these six keys at your disposal you'll be off to the races and riding fast and efficiently just like your mind works so if you like this video if
