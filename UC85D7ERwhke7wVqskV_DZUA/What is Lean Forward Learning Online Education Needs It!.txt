what is the best way to improve at something watching or doing yes both are needed but we improve the most by doing we learn faster and better when we immerse ourselves in the very thing we want to learn and we already know this when a student wants to learn spanish assuming they're lucky enough what do they do they move to spain that student will be miles ahead of and away from another student who tried to learn by only watching videos online that's because only watching videos is passive it encourages a lack of engagement and a blank screen face it pushes you into a passive mode of consuming a lean back mode again we already know this but if we know this let's do better if we are in a position to teach something it's up to us to make the learning experience come alive to force the student to lean forward to engage with the material and if the material calls for it to make them practice the exact skills they wish to learn that's my intention behind obsidian flight school obsidian flight school promotes lean forward learning it's an immersive force you to learn by doing educational product its goal to make students faster at using the note application known as obsidian along with making students faster more skilled and more confident in obsidian my personal goal with flight school is that it inspires other online teachers in other fields to incorporate lean forward principles into their own educational products and services but before i share the paradigm behind lean forward learning let's review how we got here if you search obsidian on youtube you'll probably come across my free obsidian for beginners series it's just six videos but they've been helpful for a lot of people the first video has been viewed over 330 000 times since it was released just over a year ago and since then a lot of people have asked hey can you do a course in obsidian and i've resisted for two main reasons for me number one the linking your thinking workshops is where all the really amazing stuff is happening and then number two other people out there who are really great have already created courses on obsidian so i wasn't that excited to add yet another course to the ecosystem if it wasn't somehow different and for a long time i wasn't sure what that difference would be but then it finally clicked obsidian flight school fly around your notes at the speed of thought and the premise was this the activity of linking your thinking is extremely powerful but before you can feel that power you have to feel comfortable in the ship you're using to fly around your knowledge now i call that ship the linking your thinking ship aka the light ship and it's the tool you pilot to fly around your planet of personal knowledge this course would train students to become faster more skilled and more confident in obsidian so i went to designing it and here's what it became so what is obsidian flight school well in plain speak it is an educational product and a starter kit designed to improve your ability to use the note application called obsidian flight school is for you if you downloaded obsidian and feel a little overwhelmed if you want to become faster and using obsidian or if you want to experience more joy while using the obsidian app however flight school is not going to be for everyone it's not for you if you primarily use a mobile or tablet device without a keyboard and that's because we do a tremendous amount of keyboard shortcuts flight school is also not for you if you want training to build your custom pkm system that's what the linking you're thinking workshop is for and finally it's also not for you if you want training to develop ways to sustainably think better and create more value over your lifetime because again that's what the linking you're thinking workshop is for moving on so what's included well with flight school you get the vault and that is over 240 lessons and notes that also includes 100 embedded videos and over 10 exercises and simulations there's also peer-to-peer forum access and lifetime updates so that's what you can expect from flight school but i get really excited about it because flight school is an experiment in choose your own adventure non-linear education and that makes it a big risk and i knew some people would love it and i knew that some people would hate it so far though not even one percent of the people don't love it which is way better than i was hoping for regardless when it comes to actually getting better at something i will never stop shouting reps reps reps if you really want to learn how to pilot obsidian guess what you have to pilot it watching videos alone is not enough so i want to show you a little bit of flight school but before i do let's talk briefly about the paradigm that emerged from building it the six principles of lean forward learning online learning is just different and it's the wild west out there right now the wild frontier as i mentioned earlier my deepest goal with obsidian flight school is that it inspires other teachers in online education to incorporate the paradigm of lean forward learning into their own educational products courses and services really the lean forward paradigm is an extension of the learn by doing theory of education set forth by john dewey in the early 1900s however the difference here is that the lean forward paradigm outlines principles specifically with online education in mind i believe online programs designed like flight school are just the beginning of a deeper level of digital learning sitting back and passively watching instructional videos that's easy but the results are far less powerful instead this flight school formula forces you to grab the controls and pilot the ship as you fly around your own pkm planet is it scary you bet kind of like when my dad put my older brother behind the wheel of an old ford pickup truck for the first time on this winding mountain road while the nine-year-old me clung to the back seat with my eyes fixated on the cliff edge just to the right i tell you you can learn fast in the right environment so with online education in mind i would like to present to you the six principles of lean forward learning designing the right educational product with these principles in mind may help provide your students with an effective and profound learning experience so let's go down the list the number one principle it's curated yet non-linear there is a sense of freedom and yet a sense of structure as a student you have some agency yourself to choose your own adventure number two hands-on repetitions the very nature of the program builds in inescapable hands-on repetitions with the exact thing you are trying to learn just like a video game if you don't take controls and move forward you don't make progress in other words it's designed to force a sort of unavoidable engagement number three uncomfortable the very nature of the program means that the adventurer will be uncomfortable challenged and sometimes even frustrated guess what those are the deep reps that's when the deepest stickiest learning happens and it's getting stuck that leads to sticky learning number four it's immersive it feels like a special self-contained mini world a holistic learning system now it doesn't need the latest unreal graphics engine but it just needs something that feels like it's a complete living breathing system nicely self-contained number five it's measurable there are ways for students to measure their progress and lastly number six there are multiple avenues of engagement this is especially important in the online realm students don't just read and watch they do plus that's not it they also do some sort of combination of the following commenting interacting sharing this ties back into getting repetitions reading reps watching reps doing reps supported by reps commenting interacting and sharing when these principles combine it creates an all-encompassing tsunami of a learning experience and it was my intention to apply them to something as straightforward as learning a new application so now after all that's out of the way and as a way of introducing flight school to you let's rate it through the lean forward learning principles are you ready let's go so what does it look like when we boot up flight school well here's a folder that's all it is it's just a folder on your desktop that's what's so cool what we're going to do now is open it up which i've already done so i'm just going to actually expand it here when you start flight school it looks like this flight school arrival you work your way through we can't really do the whole orientation right now but the idea is that there are four different areas that you can go so if we were to go to the checklist we see that there's a bit of a checklist that you can go to and if you want to go back we know we can navigate this way we can also go to the hanger which is my favorite place to go and that will give you the curated experience through flight school where you can start in the basic training wing work your way into the piloting wing there's an instruments wing and also a resources wing so different wings but it seems as though you can kind of bounce around as you need to let's go back to arrival at the top here a little uplink and then the last kind of big map would be the flight school map if we go here let me collapse the nice video there we see that this is also providing more of a site map not every note by the way there are 240 plus notes in flight school alone here but we see the main ones that can take us off to different jumping points they're like little portals that take us to a new area as you get into flight school one things we cover are workspaces so if i were to open up the map view well those are those four notes laid out in sliding pane view for me so i can see arrival here i can see checklist hanger and then if i want i can go over to map so let's go back to the core view with the main view you start with which is arrival now how do we rate this through the lens of the lean forward learning principles so i just created a note i'm going to open it up let me pin this and then open this up into a new pane and how does this work with curated yet non-linear i hope you can already see that a lot of intention and design has been built around making it just like that so in that curated and non-linear way we see that we have an arrival area and there's a curated way to go about things and that's the core experience mainly in the hangar but if you want something that's non-linear you can go wherever you want you can go into the flight school let me pin this real fast you can go into flight school map and then say well let's go into uh preview mode you can say i want to jump into obsidian core maneuvers what does that even mean what are the core maneuvers of obsidian and then you can kind of see where we're going with that right here and then you can look into the simulations maybe you want to start with a simulation and then see where you're at maybe it's a little bit too advanced for your current um skill level so then you have to go back and then start going through some of the the legs that lead up to the the beginning of everything else so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense there are different parts and what's interesting is you record your total time and we'll get to that in a second but if i'm going back to rating flight school curated yet non-linear i'm going to say the whole experience has been designed around this you have four core notes which i just showed you some cadets prefer using that checklist others the map and then others prefer using the main narrative which is the hanger i mean that's what i always recommend use the hanger but you also have the non-linear agency the freedom to go where you'd like to hands-on repetitions this is what i'm most excited about so you know curated yet non-linear five out of five i know i'm rating myself here but that's how i feel about it hands-on repetitions same exact thing it's actually what i love the most by using flight school you can't help but get hands-on repetitions with the exact thing you're trying to learn just by clicking around when you get stuck guess what you're working your way through you're working your way through some sticking point that when you get it will unlock new speeds and really cement whatever that sticking point was in your own mind in your own muscle memory perhaps so there are hands-on repetitions throughout and if we go back to well let's choose the checklist this time we can see that we have ways to test this you know there's the simulation known as the boot and then we get into some other obstacle courses for the interface for text working and even for navigation so there are plenty of places to get these hands-on repetitions and i have to give myself and flight school a five out of five um maybe maybe i'm too nice of a judge here let's keep going down the list uncomfortable some of the exercises and tests are very hard but it's in the getting stuck that leads to sticky learning i've given myself again five out of five i swear not everyone will be a five out of five it's just these are the ones that flight school has really focused on making for an experience where you get a little uncomfortable because i know that's what's going to lead to a really great breakthrough of how to do something for for instance if we want to move radiant flight school over here well how do we do that well we can just kind of hotkey it over now it's over on this side i can hotkey it have it in the middle and then i hit the hotkey it's over there or what if i just want to change the focus but not which pane i'm on well there's hotkey for that so now you can see i'm changing which pane i'm focused on but i'm not moving the panes so there are all sorts of things you can do with the keyboard to take your thinking to the next level i mean seriously that's why i say it's fly around at the speed of thought because once you unlock the technical hurdles and once you figure out what you can do then wow you can get to that next level so there are plenty of opportunities to become uncomfortable and get stuck and when you break through those sticking points it leads to new speeds immersive this is i'd say a four out of five i mean we are dealing with a plain text enviro i mean these are just plain text notes which are which are really cool but it's not the unreal engine uh powering the latest video game so but it is however a self-contained world and once you're there you don't have to leave is it measurable there are timed tests and you can share your times it kind of works i think it gives you something to strive for if we want to look at one other test let's see let's go let's go into the interface obstacle course so i'm going to open this in a new pane here's the new pane and you can see there's a start there are five parts to it and then there's a stop and it says go back to the interface and record your time so if you went to the interface note you could record your time and see how you compare and you can see am i an ace pilot if i was below eight and a half minutes i'm an ace pilot if i'm between 8 30 and 9 30 you're solid if if it's 9 30 to 10 30 decent 10 30 11 30 okay if you're over 11 and a half minutes the recommendation is to try again and you can put your times here so this is a way that we can have something that's a little measurable so now let's go back to the rating system and last multiple avenues of engagement and this is actually the weakest aspect of flight school now it definitely gets the doing part down all these repetitions strong doing so you're definitely doing reading doing watching and especially the doing but where it's a little weak is in the lightweight forum component which there exists a forum component where people can ask questions or if they get stuck with something technical they can bring it up there but in the end this is a self-guided experience so it doesn't result in a lot of commenting social interaction or sharing now there's a little bit but that's why i say you know overall it's a three because it doesn't quite nail the multiple avenues of engagement now if i was reading the linking your thinking workshop this is a five out of five but um in this self-contained program it's it's a three out of five so there you go this is how i would rate the obsidian flight school through the lens of the lean forward learning principles i hope you enjoyed let's go back to the conclusion this is a good time to make a major point not every online course needs to incorporate every lean forward principle there are plenty of basic courses out there where consuming the required information is more important than getting deep reps with the material for example podcasts they're meant to be consumed at a lighter level of depth usually so if you are considering creating an online course or something here is the core question to ask is this just about transferring information or is it also about building skills and habits if it's also about building skills and habits then i would encourage you to consider the lean forward learning principles as you design your course or learning experience side note you may be thinking but i have nothing to teach well you are wrong your experiences are worth more than you think but even if you don't want to put something formal together the hidden value of understanding the principles that we just covered is that you will start approaching anything that you learn online with the awareness of what it's missing for example if a course doesn't force you to get repetitions you can find a way to add your own now before we leave i'd like you to consider what other apps courses workshops and programs have you been a part of online video only courses khan academy workshops cohorts how would you rate them in the lean forward learning principles if it includes a focus on building skills and habits then i hope it also included a few of the lean forward learning principles the best way to learn effectively deeply powerfully is by wrestling with the thing you want to learn over and over again in different ways from different angles after receiving different instruction at least that's my strong opinion weekly held this is after all an experiment an exploration an essay into the activity of immersive engaged and effective online learning at the very least i hope it helps you become a better online learner and teacher hey if you feel like you
