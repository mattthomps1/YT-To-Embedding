if you are wondering how to manage projects tasks teams and yourself prepare to receive great value from this presentation by francisco pricio francisco is a theoretical physicist by profession software developer by choice automotive referenced by luck entrepreneur by conviction and music lover by passion he's also a book predator by pleasure and a writer by necessity in the following francisco showcases a project management workflow that is so practical simple and effective as you'll soon see francisco didn't start managing projects yesterday even though he's a theoretical physicist he doesn't have a theoretical productivity system he has a battle tested and proven system that's as effective as it is elegant let's view francisco's process now first i need to say that i'm a big mess i'm not as organized as what i have seen so far i'm a very very big mess but in some points that has been a negative part of my life on the other side it has very been very positive because i think i'm very creative and i say all this just because we are among peers i usually don't say these kind of things however as i said i mean i get distracted very very very easily so that's why my home note doesn't say home it says focus because that's kind of a reminder to me that i just need to focus focus focus so uh this is this is my home node my home note is a little bit different basically as you see my screen on the left is quite simple i pretty much have everything on the reference all the files is like a big bolt of documents right there so i only have these three documents on my left focus command and and to do that i'm going to explain a little bit later on the focus this is just like my message no all my ideas i call them command n as a reference of the new document for or a new anything usually is command and so that's my code name for all my projects but since i get distracted very very easily i always try to focus into some kind of guidelines and i use the the 7ws principle to do this where i have my who what why when where whom uh try to uh see where where i'm going so basically these are the guidelines who define if i'm going to get in involved in a project or if i'm just going to skip it or leverage to somebody else to do it uh for me the first one is who i am so i i i see here and i have uh documents for all my different roles in my life as a husband father godfather etc etc and then this is what do i want and this one is is important because i my once i added my ones as a tags so in order to do any project or any idea i looked first if those ideas align to my interest otherwise they can be a distraction and that will make it less productive so these are my interests i'm interested in technology in nature and business in music and literature and personal growth and in these things in particular in technology just computers software big data technology etc etc so these are these are the tags that i'm using for for this and i'm using the attack wrangler plugin which is really nice so if you see all of them start with an i so that's the i stands for interest so they are all nested here on my tags here on on right here so everything is is um is nested um but those those are my ones and then when when i when i'm gonna do all these things so i have a very strict uh rituals and daily rituals on when i'm going to the all these do all my personal stuff and give time to to do everything that i have to do so i i try to make myself uh more or less strict on that that part then it comes the what and this in particular is what are the things that i need to do consistently to get what i want so what are my standards what are my no negotiables i call what are the things that i'm going to do no matter what every day so i can i can get what i want and then this other one it also applies to tax because it's who i'm going to leverage of course i i will not be able to do all these things that i'm doing if i didn't have the support of people so on the on the whom i have the people that that i surround myself that that helped me uh on my first level uh to accomplish my things so these are the people that i that i that work with me and i have also attacked for this one p for pers a person and the name of the of the of the person that that helps me on on each of these these things so that means that every project will have to have a line i want and somebody that is going to help me to to to do all this and finally i have the where and where i'm going to all this do all these things and this also applies to what are the tools that i'm going to use i i love technology so i get distracted by new tools new things so incorporating a new tool is just a learning process so i try to avoid that unless it's something so cool as obsidian but i try to minimize myself the number of tools that i'm using so i'm not just jumping around in different tools all that all the time and then finally this just personal stuff i just thank everybody that's helped me and everything everyone i'm grateful for just as a reminder i also have a section for my principles that i i like to review every every week where i have my motto and the things that that i i i do believe and from time to time this has been growing and changing but these are more or less my principles of life so having said that the main thing is is go to my command end which is pretty much the the thing that i see almost every day and here are all my ongoing projects right now divided by the different kind of businesses so these are all my business projects and my personal projects that i'm going on right now and as you see for example if i just move around here on each of these projects the first thing that appears is the next step the only way to accomplish this is that every project every week moves it doesn't matter it's just one thing one phone call one email but everything has every project i'm involved with i need to do one at least one thing per week just to keep them going so what i'm looking is for progress not perfection so if i go for example to this one called authenticon this is the name of the project the first thing on the top is the next step which i talk with the next and uh this is what what is next for this this this one in particular then it comes the my why why i'm doing this i mean why is this important for me and and sometimes it's good for me to to read why why i wanted to do this why this is important for me then i have a list of contacts that are involved in in this project there are the next tasks i have to do these are not all the tasks i'm going to show you where i have all my my big list of tasks these are the ones that are next online just so i don't get overwhelmed by a whole bunch of things to do these are the next ones that i need to work on then uh oven these are things that is important for me to remember but i don't want them to get uh buried on their layers and layers of to do to do the two things to do and um so this is what i call the the the oven this is these are things that are cooking and then i have my links and and here on the links and using the url capacity of of obsidian i get some quite nice things for example uh right now i'm where i'm looking at authenticon as a project and if i click here on email messages it will open my gmail and it will open immediately with a search for authenticon so i get all the email messages for this particular project right right there in one one shot with one click the other thing that i uh i have this is owler which is a tool that i use a lot to uh to research on on companies this tool keeps me informed of what's going on with with the different companies i'm involved with and same thing if i click here on older i get information about this company how the company is doing and if there are any news about this uh in individual or or company that i'm working on then uh there's a section um for uh for all the information that i've been gathering in the time and then uh here on on the on the journal uh what what i have is is what what's everything that i've been doing with this with this account in particular then i have my metadata and and if this is aligned with some of my uh principles as i said if it's not aligned with at least one of these things i don't i don't get involved too much into into this uh as you see for example the next step for this one is uh precisely today so if i if i um go to um to today's activity uh then i get uh today and i have my most important things for the day so these are the three things i i need to do today that are more more important for me and all my next steps using the search functionality on obsidian i it pulls from the different projects what are the next steps for any of these projects if there's something for so for authenticon i have this thing to do today and for this of course linking your thinking is my presentation that i'm doing to you guys today and then it goes all my agenda where these are the things that i have to do today so i i write write write the notes on on every meeting that i have my 10 a.m 11 a.m 14 etc etc and um and that's pretty much it uh just to finish uh what i want to say is that my my initial bolt or my initial point of capture is not obsidian uh what i use is uh drafts i use drafts uh very very much but i have added some functionality into drafts to either save ideas or things that i'm capturing on my mobile phone or my ipad or or anything into obsidian or to create a to-do list so for example if i say buy milk and i click here to do to obsidian then when i go back to obsidian here on my to-do here's where i have my master task list and here's by milk at the very very top and and i keep this with another plugin who moves all my completed tags to to the very bottom of the of the file so everything everything stay stays here um so um i guess that's pretty much it uh uh nick well yeah round of applause for francisco uh yeah i think i think there'll be a few questions uh very you know a lot of different questions coming in um just fyi you know francisco is in cohort two so he's had a little bit more time to you know fine-tune bits of his personalized system which we can definitely see this was um quite inspiring and eye-opening in many ways so thank you okay well one more time let's give francisco that round of applause that was really really great so okay seeing francisco's process is greatly inspiring he shows how to manage projects in a clear deliberate simple and yet powerful way this is the signal folks it's not the noise if you are sometimes feeling lost in the anxiety of what to focus on or you often seem to lose steam on many of your goals this is a way to successfully marry productivity to linked-based frameworks to unlock a whole new way of managing your projects your teams and yeah yourself as always there are a lot more of these inspiring tours i hope to showcase because they show how personal the process of thinking and managing knowledge can be hey if you enjoyed this like one of the comments below or write your own and until next time stay
