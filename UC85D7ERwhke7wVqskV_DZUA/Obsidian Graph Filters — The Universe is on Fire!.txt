i'll be straight with you for the past several 
months i could care less about the graph you   in in linked networking uh note-taking apps i mean 
to me it was just kind of a gravy on top the icing   on the cake right like how are we really using the 
graph view but in version 0.9.0 the game is subtly   changed once again the developers have added a lot 
of interesting features and they do two things for   me that i've already noticed they increase the 
level of joy that i have with working in obsidian   working with my notes making new notes and number 
two it increases the level of of frictionless   creativity so in the following demo i want to 
show you what i found so far and this is just   hot off the press so what i found so far that has 
improved my workflow two major things coming up   okay so let's hop into this new graph so here's 
the main overview first thing i'm going to do i'll   collapse this side just to give us some more space 
let me open up graph view it loads i'm collapsing   the left hand side as well and so here's my graph 
i'm just going to center it maybe zoom in a little   bit new features check it out upper left filters 
and layout there's a lot going on here so let's   just break it down let's play with each option 
and then we're going to get into the two workflows   that i've already that i can already see these two 
workflows are going to help my creative process   i'm very excited about that so hey let's look 
we have a search window where we can search for   any term any term so let's just blinking 
i know this will come up a lot i hit enter   and these are the notes that have the word 
linking in them i can zoom in further if i   wanted to that's kind of neat now let's just keep 
linking on and i can add tags so now we can toggle   tags and you know there's kind of been this push 
to get rid of tags and make everything uh a note   a direct link for some reason that didn't quite 
feel right it felt like we wanted to maintain the   sort of a weaker relationship between notes and 
this is one reason because now we can turn on tags   and see which notes are connected so these are all 
the notes that have linking not just in the title   but it can be in the body of the note as well and 
the associated tags don't worry we'll dive into   the examples i can also turn on attachments 
nothing for this i don't think which is fine   existing files only all right so now we'll 
notice that some files start to disappear   because i haven't created a lot of files i've 
only linked to them to create them in the future   and then we can also turn on orphan notes all 
right so these are notes i would also call most   orphan notes to be boats which are blocks 
of atomic thought they're kind of boat notes   they're just floating out by themselves so now 
we've turned all these things on we can look at   this graph and kind of check that out now another 
thing that's kind of neat is when we do create a   link between two notes it's a bi-directional 
link but really technically speaking   when you create the the link it's going from 
one direction to another and so we can turn   on arrows to make this explicit now now we 
can start to see that these arrows they're   pretty tiny on the screen but they exist and we 
can see sometimes they point in both directions   like this one and sometimes they point in a single 
direction like this note to this tag okay cool   now we can get into let's let's take away the 
linking and i hit enter to go back to everything   okay cool now let's go into the layout we 
just turned on arrows node size it starts   around one and now we can make the nodes 
really big i don't think you want to do that   let's go back to one i find it's really good 
just to keep it there link thickness again i   don't think the thickness really helps maybe you 
want to go with less thickness it starts around   one so maybe we take it to let's say 0.7 ish and 
just make those lines a little bit less thick   pretty awesome okay now we we are going 
into some really neat gravitational i don't know meters that we can control so the 
first is center force so if we turn on center   force what's happening is the gravitational force 
is becoming stronger so now all of these nodes   are much closer to each other right probably 
a little bit too much let's back that down   and let's just for right now we'll take 
it we'll keep it at well let's do 0.7 okay   repel force so this is you know how much 
they're pushing away from each other so if   i turn that up they start to push away then we 
have link force the strength of the actual links   and then we have link distance so how close they 
are versus here let's minimize minimize minimize   move out now let's look at link distance so 
this best way to do is to just look at one link   and then see if i turn it on the link distance 
expands if i turn it down the distance   decreases it shortens so for the most 
part i find that this layout information   you'll just want to adjust it once and then 
you'll kind of find the settings that work for   you so let's spend less time with the layout and 
now dive into a couple use cases i've discovered   i think you can discover some too that will 
work for you but i want to point out these   two because they are awesome to keep you creative 
they are awesome to keep you in note making mode   so we're not just mindlessly wandering around 
this uh magilla universe of notes but we're   actually diving in we're using the graph to our 
benefit and we're making actionable steps forward so now let's start with hashtag habit i 
know i have a lot of notes with this and   we can see i'll get rid of the tag 
actually so i can see all the notes   get rid of orphans existing notes only get rid 
of attachments so these are all the notes i have   that have a hashtag habit in them and i have 
a couple moc notes these are maps of content   i have a lot to share about 
these in different videos   but what i want to point out is existing files 
only so this is where we start to toggle something   and it's important to toggle it just like i'm 
doing so right now these are only existing files   i toggle it off and you notice now we have these 
grayed out nodes these are notes that haven't been   created but i've linked to them so let's let's 
imagine i'm focused on or you're focused on   this project you want to write an article 
you want to just get your mind wrapped around   habits you've read some books you know the power 
of habit atomic habit you just you've had habits   in your life and you want to make sense of this 
knowledge as you're making sense you might make   an evergreen note we'll get to that term later 
you might make the evergreen note called habits   carry a ton of hidden inertia okay now in the 
course of making this note you link to this new   idea called the flywheel effect but you you 
don't want to create it right now that's a   whole other thing so when i toggle existing 
files only and i turn it off i can now see   flywheel effect is here and so what i'm looking 
at when i toggle existing files only off is i'm   looking for easy wins i'm looking for easy notes 
i can dive into and start to develop a little bit   so if i was in this mindset i would toggle off 
and i would look in and be okay where can i go   flywheel effect oh frankenstein monster that's 
one i've been wanting to flesh out survival of   the fittest that concept i want to flesh out so 
these are areas where i can dive into that note   let's go into the flywheel effect there's nothing 
here right and then i would start i would start   you know typing whatever i would like to to flesh 
this concept out so let's go back to where we were   get filters open and that's the first 
thing so the first thing that you can do   is toggle existing files only and then 
look for easy notes that you can jump into   right we want to remove friction like what do i 
want to develop and this gives you a few launching   off places it's very a very practical way to stay 
on top of your notes and stay in a creative mode   so let's just explore the graph mode a little bit 
further here's another concept now i've put that   in i hit enter or click that button to search so 
these are all the notes that have hashtag concept   in them and i toggle on existing files and so i'll 
toggle off and let's explore which note i might   want to jump into so if i toggle them off and i 
can say okay seasons this concept of seasonality   and i want to make this easier for you to read 
seasons it connects to two notes that have   that haven't been made yet the enso and 
the oroborus if i'm saying that correctly   so those are oh and dragon and phoenix so 
certain concepts here that have a cyclical   seasonality to them and if the time is right i'm 
like okay let's approach this concept i can dive   in i know exactly where to focus my time and 
it's pretty cool to go in that respect okay   okay next up let's explore one more hashtag with 
this concept and this is a a note a hashtag that   i use for notes i want to explicitly develop 
further and it's just hashtag develop so let's   search for that and i can see existing files only 
and then very quickly what i'm going to do here   is toggle that off and now i can see all sorts 
of notes that i might want to develop further the movie groundhog day leads me to bill murray 
leads me to another show that has that groundhog   day concept russian doll right here and it 
can take me to the buddhist concept of samsara   we can go in so many directions 
can you see the power of toggling   existing files only so once your library 
expands this becomes really powerful   now the next one is toggling orphans so i had 
mentioned this earlier boat notes so boat notes   are blocks of atomic thought if i create a new 
note and i haven't done anything with it i'll i'll   put it as a hashtag boat and this tells me this is 
a new idea but i haven't connected it to anything   so it's it's basically let me turn on 
toggle orphans now oh cool so these are   my boat notes they're just floating around 
in the sea of our digital note libraries   ready to be crafted to be fleshed out to be 
fully formed and connected with other things   so if i'm in that mode where i want to 
review these these isolated boat notes   graph use fantastic boat and we can toggle 
orphan on and off okay let's zoom it back out   back to the whole graph let's turn off tags 
existing files only let's not show the orphans   and so this is the graph as we'd normally 
see it i hope you found this useful   this is hot off the press so i'm sure there 
are other uses that you're going to find   please share those in the comments below so we can 
all grow together but yeah if you like this please   subscribe there's a lot more to come and if you're 
curious about what library i'm using here this is   the light kit and this library can be yours i'm 
going to be doing a webinar soon it's going to be   pretty pretty cool i think pretty helpful too it's 
been downloaded i'm not sure over 3000 times so   it's provided a lot of help to a lot of people 
and we'll be going over the light kit in the   next couple of weeks two days ago i wasn't 
planning to shoot this video but i mean graph   you with these filtering options it's powerful 
and i just had to share it so i hope you found   the ability to toggle existing files the ability 
to toggle orphan notes and to practically use that   to enhance the joy that you have with the program 
and the creativity that you can maintain with the   program i hope you found this useful if you did 
please consider subscribing hit the bell too so   you know the new videos that are coming and i 
promise you there are many videos coming this   month and also this graph view it's so new so 
if you discover some cool feature some practical   use case please share that in the comments 
below so we can all grow together thank you   so much for watching i hope you found value 
i really appreciate your time until next time you
