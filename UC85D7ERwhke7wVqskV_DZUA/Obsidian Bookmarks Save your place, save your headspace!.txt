are obsidian bookmarks really a feature to get excited about well first of all you know what starred notes are right it's where you say that this note is more important than all the other notes over here so you click this button and you give it a star stars are important for Mario and stars are important for us too but here's the problem starred notes are great for about the first 5 or 10 stars or if you're the Marvel Cinematic Universe about the first 22 movies but then it just becomes a problem too many stars you can't keep track of them all so each star loses the thing that made it special in the first place that's why I wasn't excited about obsidian's newest plug-in bookmarks which at first seem just like starred notes to me until I realized it isn't about Starry notes it's about how bookmarks allow easier ways to work more effectively I'll show exactly what I mean in this video I'll show what bookmarks do how I'm using them right now and one trap to avoid okay let's go as a quick hello I'm Nick Milo and I'm here to help you improve how you go about thinking and if you can think better almost every single decision Downstream just got a little bit easier part one what do bookmarks do okay diving into my obsidian which I call the idea verse we're going to go over what bookmarks are even about so I'm going to twirl Down obsidian's release notes for version 1.2.2 bookmarks this is copy straight from them the starred chord plug-in is going away and they're introducing bookmarks so we'll jump into both of these pretty shortly you'll see why I don't like starred and why bookmarks is all of a sudden unlocking a lot of effective ways to work bookmark just about anything in obsidian files folders graphs searches headings blocks organize them with a much more robust bookmark view we can reorder with drag and drop and we can create groups that you'll see pretty quickly to organize those bookmarks into collapsible sections so to give you an example of this right now let's jump into this other essay I wrote as a part of a series we were taught the rules of math and English not of ideas so this is pretty cool but let's just say for whatever reason there's something in this section that I want to come back to I want to give it a bookmark so how do we do that so this is a header and what's cool is I can do I even have to highlight let's find out so if I just right click I have an option to bookmark this heading that's all it takes so let's go ahead and see it's got a path I can give it a title and say I'll say rules of ideas clean up just give myself a note or something and let's put that in progress points we'll get into what progress points are very shortly but what I want you to know now is that we have a section rules of ideas cleanup so if I close this tab and I come over to bookmarks I can now go immediately to clean up and it takes us straight to the section that we want to work on that's pretty nice now I jumped ahead a little bit to rough up the surface now let's step back and see exactly how we install bookmarks it's actually going to be pretty easy so hopefully by about the time that you're watching this recording bookmarks will be available to everyone right now it's insiders only but I'm sure that's going to change about a week or two after you see this recording so I'm going to open up the settings and we want to just go to core plugins and just make sure you've toggled bookmarks on you'll also notice that I have starred notes toggled on as well I I've never like started I mean look I have basically all of the core plugins turned on but I never like starred notes because I felt it was a bit of a crutch we could accomplish that and so much more through actual links so I didn't want to kind of rely on start notes bookmarks we'll see allows for a little bit of a better way to work and avoid a lot of the pitfalls of just over starting notes so closing that you can see in starred notes I have a note that can take me to my home note and this is a part of the light kit that you can download in the description below let's close this jump back to bookmarks and we're going to go over to bookmarks and what you'll notice here are a lot of strange folders I've created so you have an option you can be on whatever page you are here any tab and you can go ahead and just bookmark the active tab ignore these settings and you'll notice that the bookmark is just like a star note right here waiting for me however in the next part we're going to cover some of these interesting ways that I found to use the new bookmark plugin functionality part two how I'm using bookmarks all right we're back onto my screen and what you'll notice here is I'm back in the bookmarks Tab and just so you know we have our regular folder structure here the access folder structure if you're curious to learn more about this we'll have a link up here appear one of those two spots and you can learn more about the access folder structure it's not the only way to do linked based thinking it's a really good way to get started though and just make sure that you have your bases covered now let's go back to the bookmarks Tab and these are some of the more interesting ways I've so far thought about using bookmarks and I want to walk you through each one real fast so I'm playing off of bookmarks and I have map marks so let's jump into map marks to begin with these are those high level maps of content in case I just want the fastest access possible this gives unreliable access I can go to the bookmarks Tab and find what I'm looking for it's a really great example here is the light kit I can click right here and I'm at the map of content for the light kit and I can go back and make sure all this stuff is good whatever I wanted to do here same thing for flight school I can go to the arrival page and be Off to the Races we also have I was using this for canvas so you can use the canvas note and then you can bookmark that and you can throw that into let's see what that would look like so this is a weekly schedule I was playing around with it's a little tiny on the screen we don't care about the details right now what we do care about are these three dots so if we click on the three dots go ahead and bookmark you'll see the same options here you can fill in whatever you want to save and since it's recognized it's already a part of my bookmark collection it went ahead and updated the existing bookmark now I really don't like that name because that means nothing so go back three dots bookmark and I'll paste in the old one and that's looking pretty good right so map marks high level marks now I prefer to have a home note I prefer to have our maps of content they're based on links and they're extremely reliable they're amazingly future proof and they help you navigate your knowledge in the moment and in the years to come so maps of content are the most important hopefully we link to another video for that as well but it doesn't hurt to have a couple that you can just go to bookmarks and find really fast moving on what do we have we have time marks so under time marks we might have if you do some sort of daily note workflow you might have a specific daily note that you just wrote a lot in maybe you were journaling in in the morning in kind of like a first light last Light workflow or you just found a bunch of daily Sparks and you were writing all these daily Sparks out so for me this one's pretty simple for an example I just wrote something about the doorway effect that I found was really interesting and so I linked to it so I can come back to it and this other obsidian plugin actually that I thought was really cool and I wanted to explore so this is basically me using that temporary sticky note for this so I can come back to it and do whatever processing or sense making I need to with those notes now graph marks was work is kind of interesting so we have a basic Global graph this is the big graph of mine I think it's handling around 5000 notes so it's still doing pretty pretty good job there but everyone's complained oh the global graph it doesn't allow me to do what I want to in local graph well with bookmarks it allows the global graph to really Flex its muscles for us because we can do all the work one time and then save that view save that search I'll give you an example of this one I can just change some colors so now we've added a few colors it doesn't look too different but here's the one let's imagine I want to work on a new piece of content let's call it an expression and one of those expressions is going to be ranked higher than the rest so in each of these notes I can now color code and see at a distance what I might want to look at and sometimes there are some interesting connections that form and that can really inform what I choose to work on or say I'm going to do this one first but it connects to that one so be mindful that these things do connect and that's where we get the advantage of being able to see the graph view now for the most part most of them won't connect but even here we see that the grappling hook that I was just talking about connects to this video so if I ever get to the grapping hook and totally going to remember that I need to mention bookmarks because there's something cool I want to share about that when it comes to hotkeys okay moving on now we are working on a video that's ranked five and it's we're working on this one right here so I can hold command on Mac control and windows I get the pop-up preview and look at this I'm looking at the note that we're working on it's over here so the graph view with this saved search that's all it is it's a saved search so of the graph I've bookmarked it it's my graph Mark and it's really helpful for me to see what I might want to work on and I've color coded all the different rankings here now I'm going to include a few of these examples in the next version of obsidian flight school you can see the link in the description below and a bit of a side note if you're wondering why I love obsidian so much it's because I realize that this single tool compels me to think better to generate more prolifically and to do it in a secure and future-proof way and getting faster at this one tool unlocks all sorts of opportunities for thinking better and doing better work whatever that means for you and if you want to allow obsidian to supercharge your thinking definitely check out obsidian fight School in the description below it'll help you start working closer to the speed of thought so moving on we're going to go from graph marks to search marks so this is kind of interesting I've saved a search so search is over here let's say I want to search for prolific which I've already done and I want to show less context and spell prolific correctly and collapse all the results so right away that we can see that there are 84 results and next to those results you'll notice that there is that there are the three dots again go ahead click on that and then you can bookmark that saved search so under my search marks my saved searches that have been bookmarked you'll find that prolific is right here so I can click on that and immediately I can re-access those results now um let's also do a little test here and I have not done this ahead of time but I'm curious who I have more mentions of Mia hi chick sent me high at 95 results let me go ahead and bookmark that and as I bookmark this search I'm going to make sure I click here and choose a group to put it in in this case search marks let's compare mihai with Carl saggins I'll do a second 106. okay so Carl wins this spout this will change over time but kind of neat search marks and it's saved so now for whatever reason if I was doing research on those two people and if anyone's been watching my Channel or it's been a part of the workshop you definitely know I like to mention these two a few different times so now I've saved searches for them okay now for those who are trying to get things done to accomplish things we have progress points we already saw one example this I can go immediately to rules of ideas and say this is the section I still need to clean up and I bounce immediately to that sub header very nice I have a couple others let's imagine I was going through flight school and the last place I left off was before the simulation on getting better with working with text okay great or here's one we did a little live thing called how to work a book and I was really happy with some of the stuff I didn't even show but I did for my personal benefit of how to keep track of book notes but the big massive awesome context around it to truly understand what the author was bringing to it so I want to make sure that I update my personal book template with some of the evolutions I've made here we can do this with tags however if you have a few that you really want to keep at a high level and make sure you don't forget maybe you throw them as a bookmark as a progress point just an idea I don't know maybe it'll work for you maybe it won't now sometimes we just have this feeling something is truly deeply resonating vibrating with us sparking with us those are virgins points disturbances in the force where there's a tremendous amount yes it's a Star Wars term tremendous amount of energy has gathered right it's like this this Nexus point so I want to capture that and make sure I can jump into that I don't want to show you this one because I don't think it's ready for for the Public's eyes but that's where I can then go and then work on that thing okay maybe I'll do a sneak peek here great Bakery yeah so I have a something I want to do an ultimate guide for everyone to really understand the the value behind linking your thinking as simply as possible and there are a lot of great ideas in here so that's what I have in this area and then last let's close this one Hemingway points so some of us might be familiar with the very popular writing style of Ernest Hemingway and one of the things Hemingway said he did was he would stop mid-sentence when he still felt like he was having a lot of energy with a piece of writing and then he'd pick that place up in the morning knowing that he would not be stuck but they could just hit the ground running so I might have a specific sort of bookmark if we go back to this video you can see that I've bookmarked this video I've also bookmarked the hook for the grappling hook video that I'm talking about which would have a reference to an old regular Nintendo game Bionic Commando so that's my hook that's my Hemingway point because I know I can hit the ground running with what I had in mind here so just to recap there are a lot of different ways you can use bookmarks it's not just the typical hey I want to start that note but I want to leave you with this this is a first take the bookmarks plugin it's very new in my example there's just to get you thinking I want to show you what's possible but whatever I showed you I'm sure will change or evolve as I find what works best for my workflow I'm really curious which one resonates the most with you or even better how are you already using obsidians bookmarks plugin let us know in the comments below part three The Fault in Our Stars the Trap is this using bookmarks to temporarily Star notes while this is helpful in theory It suffers from that pollution effect the more you add the less shiny each one becomes until you can't even remember why you starred them in the first place what's cool about the bookmarks plugin is that both beginners and advanced users can use it right away beginners you can use it as a way to Simply star a few notes just not too many and advanced users you can use it in all the ways we already showed above and probably a lot more even though I wasn't excited about obsidian's bookmarks plugin initially I now recognize it's not about Starry notes it's about allowing bookmarks to help you do your best work more effectively I hope you found this video useful if so please give it a thumbs up or subscribe even that would be really nice and until next time stay connected [Music] foreign [Music]
