okay let's pick up from where we left off 
and if you remember we had enabled custom css   and when we do that we have these custom themes 
buttons and we also really quickly explored   base mode changing it from dark to light so now 
we're in light mode here's kind of what the app   looks like this might be familiar to what you're 
used to when you're working with most of the   apps until recently around they've always been in 
quote light mode it was just the only mode we knew   now there's dark mode i tend to prefer it too i 
know it's trendy but it is kind of nice especially   when you're looking at the screen for long hours 
so for now we're in dark mode and let's explore   community themes so what you do is you find a 
theme you're just scrolling oh this one's new and we can click use and so now we're in 
this custom theme which is really big let me   i'll show you this hotkey later 
but you can reduce the size   on things and you can kind of see what this 
looks like um let's try a different one hopefully okay so this is a really nice theme 
that's similar to the custom theme   and it has a really cool map okay so 
these maps aren't showing up too well   if you noticed on my other screen i have this 
pretty advanced looking setup so i don't mean to   go too crazy with this but let's use it for this 
purpose so this is part of what's called the light   kit which is the linking your thinking kit and 
this is a starter kit so as you gain an experience   you might think like how do i connect everything i 
use folders do i use tags what can i use links you   know to connect these ideas over time it's easy 
when we have 50 notes but when we have 500 and we   have 5000 it's a different story so i created this 
kit to allow you to kind of figure out how that   works that'll be a different video and a whole 
different series for now though let's use it to   explore themes so this is a custom theme this is 
called cybertron which um i created and it's kind   of like futuristic and stuff you can see a little 
bit of the look so what's kind of neat here is   remember bold in this theme bold is its own 
color and you know if we wanted something to be   italicized that's its own color you can see the 
color for links if we want to click on direction   that takes us to this direction note if we click 
on four virtues that takes us to this note a   lot going on here let's not just stay on this 
theme though let's go back to that really cool   kind of obsidian alternative theme by one 
of the obsidian mods on the discord forum   actually so this is pretty cool it's clean it 
really takes advantage of that purple color and if we look at the graph view here it's 
a pretty cool looking thing and we can click   into any of these notes let's click into what 
our higher order notes and here's the structure   of a note listed now we're in edit view and 
we can see this is a title right just that   single hash we could add hashes and reduce the 
size but that's a title we'll keep it that way   something else you might have noticed 
is this thing called the local graph   so any note i click on and this is really wild 
but we can see a local graph version of it here   i don't want to go into all those features but 
we're just exploring the themes let's check out   one more dark theme and then we'll go into light 
mode check out a few themes there and just kind of   show you what's possible so this theme um this 
is a pretty cool theme what's neat is members   of this community and you know typically any 
community they're creating themes that they enjoy   and so here's another one by a member of the 
community and you can see the different headers   are different colors so that's an important thing 
if you know for this theme it's an important thing   let's see what other colors there are 
so okay pretty cool yeah i can dig that let's stay in edit mode and let's go to 
appearance and we're going to switch to light mode   and let's check the community themes for light 
mode so we've dealt with a lot of color and this   theme as it happens is clean theme so let's 
check out clean theme see what this looks   like so i mean if you're just used to dark mode 
it's like wow you know the irises are blown out   but after you get used to it well maybe something 
can be done with the graph view but after you get   used to it it is uh going back to this attention 
note you can see here's bold here's the tablet   and we can see the different headers the 
links that we can go to different nodes   so this is a pretty minimal theme the 
idea with the minimal theme is it's   great because it's just you and the text so you 
can actually just work on your ideas and write   that's what we want to do we want to have 
a little bit of fun yes but then we want to   get back to writing thinking and linking 
so let's check out maybe just one more scrolling through why not this 
one buy another obsidian mod   and this is the light mode version of it so 
we see let's check out the different titles okay all one color which is an off black and 
then we get into our text if there is a link   it's a lighter color and let's jump back to this 
attention note here's bold here's italic so i   think you get the idea like this can be fun you 
can lose hours in this you can design your own   but it shows you the versatility 
and the power that you can have   as the graphical interface in which you interact 
as you take your notes as you make your notes   um hopefully you got something out of this 
video it's a little bit different than the   other ones because i think those other ones a 
little bit more practical this one's kind of   you know fun you can mess around with it spend 
almost too much time but it does hearken to   one of the really important reasons we 
do all this is that we want to have fun   we want the experience that we have as we manage 
our personal knowledge we want it to be a joyous   experience and i have to say when i go back 
to my cybertron theme which we'll do now this brings me more joy than it should let me 
update that this for whatever reason brings   me a lot more joy than it should i enjoy 
working i i'm more creative in this mode   but i know it's not for everyone it's you 
know it's definitely an acquired taste   the point being is a theme can allow you to 
be more productive but usually you waste a lot   more time trying to find your perfect theme so 
hopefully this gave you some ideas don't waste   too much time on it but have a little bit of fun
