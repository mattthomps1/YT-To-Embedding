hello everyone eleanor koenig is back and in the following we're going to talk about a workflow for pdfs that will make you actually want to read research papers even if you're just an amateur academic as a reminder the word amateur came from amare in latin which means to love so if you love learning but you don't have to worry about overly rigorous academic citations reference managers can still be useful for note-taking let's find out how hey everyone back for round two with eleanor eleanor how are you doing i'm so pretty good it's been a good day very nice so the first one we covered was great we're looking at how to take stuff and make something professionally with it and then this is really covering a reference manager and dealing with how to collect materials i guess using zotero and there's a lot of talk about zotero right now and i thought this might be a good way and you thought so too that we could just maybe i could see what you do and quiz you as you go along and we can kind of see how can how can people out there use the software why would they want to i'm looking at zotero as website and they say it's a free easy to use tool to help you collect organize cite and share research okay so that's interesting yeah zotero um i found out about it through obsidian like i i don't i don't run in academic circles my my master's degree is comfortably behind me and my master's degree wasn't very hard so i didn't have to do a lot with reference managers or anything but uh since i've been writing more with obsidian and i've i've been doing more more knowledge work and just learning more and being able to manage it i've found myself in a position where having a smoother workflow with annotations and note-taking uh has been beneficial and argentina gave a really great community talk i think last week actually exactly a week ago and it changed my life so uh already i've gotten so much value out of zotero and um it it seems like the sort of thing on the surface where a lot of people will look at it and go i don't need that that's not for me that's not something i need because a lot of the sort of talk around it is very academic in nature but it's it's great for so many things that i think it's worth looking at for a non-academic purpose like i mean i've been using it for websites even it's amazing it's a great tool and the the plugins that allow you to take annotations from a pdf and just plop them right into your vault perfectly formatted perfectly organized with all of your your your preferred bolding your preferred metadata and it flows right into everything the dataview can do so it's it's just been really helpful for me personally and i think it'll be helpful for other people i think it'll be helpful for for me too because i kind of skew on that side i'm not an academic i'm an amateur and i'll read i just i love you know the the certain things and topics sometimes so i'll open up a research paper what do i do with that and so zotero is intimidating but what i'm hoping for is to feel a little bit less intimidated by it you know kind of seeing how can people who don't make a living through zotero itself like the academic side of things but how can we still get value out of that and using reference managers to feed you know the rest of the system too so i'm super excited yeah i think it definitely has a learning curve i remember the first time i sort of tried to mess with it i was like this is a lot but the obsidian community helped us figure out obsidian and they also helped me figure out zotero so i'm sort of i'm happy to help you figure out zotero so we can sort of spread the spread the knowledge yeah welcome to the behind the scenes with eleanor teaching nick how zotero works [Laughter] yeah that community is great by the way it's just it's so nice people are so nice i i could not have done this if people had not held my hand so and it's so easy when you when you sort of like oh that's all you have to do but once you get it set up so that's the setup is the hard part so i guess let's dive in let me figure out share my screen and then we'll uh we'll go all right before we're done i'm going to finish both of these that's it's a little hot where i'm at so it's like cool down got ice and bro i believe in you all right so this this is my i know the last time we talked i had literally just downloaded or uninstalled dataview that day and let me tell you in the last month i have been integrating it a lot it's been incredibly helpful and it it hasn't i haven't had to go back and refactor a lot i haven't had to make a lot of changes to what i had done in order to get a lot of use out of it but as i'm going i'm noticing that i'm using it more and more so this is my references map of content so these are let me show you the data view version these are my references with summaries these are the things that i have sat down and actually made a summary for which hasn't been much mostly because when you have an entire article that you've added like you don't you don't annotate like 17 articles in a day right like you you got to sit with it you got to pull the pieces out so i've done this for two of them and this one's commented out this is just a way to you can plop this at the bottom of um this query right here this is a table with the date and the summary and the tag and all but it only pulls a particular one so if i uncomment this you'll see if i'm looking just for the ones that match my query of a tag about textiles so i use this for filling in my maps of content like i can query once this is longer i'll be able to query everything that is about economics or everything that talks about domestication and then i can sort of double check and make sure i didn't miss anything when i'm making these maps of content so that's i know we had talked last time about how to use dataview for maps of content and that's how i personally have been doing it why isn't this working oh that's very strange so in my mind the data view is super powerful and awesome and it falls under if if i can call it this but like the power users side of things so not everyone would use it but it is super powerful and there are use cases and we can fall into the pitfalls like of using it and just like trying to you know metadata everything but there i mean as you as we're seeing right here you're using it in a really interesting way because even though you're like a writer first and foremost that involves research like that involves like a big you know spigot of information coming in and so you're using it in a way to to filter and sort and and make sure you can find what you're looking for is that yeah yeah and in fact i was looking into these two things for research for my book i was interested in like i do i do a lot with the bronze age so i was interested in um i've been digging into domestication and the history of ancient civilizations and how they interact with animals because i'm trying to make sure i get the i get that relationship right like we have a lot of sort of misinformation about how early humans interacted with their sheep and how they interacted with their their dogs and stuff so i've been trying to make sure i get that right so i've been reading a lot of stuff about bronze age you know domestication of the sheep and and how that domestication process happened and in fact uh i recently wrote an article about there's a there's a lot of argument about the domestication of the horse and whether or not people rode horses um before they like hitched them to carts like how horses first got used so i've been deep in that rabbit hole because i'm trying to figure out how early horses would have been domesticated because that's something that happens during the course of my book you don't wanna you don't wanna mess that up but yeah so zotero so i actually have done more with zotero than just these two articles these are the ones that i've done most recently but if we click here i have aliased this to what's called a site key and it it's not a very friendly title um but a lot of academics will actually title their references with the site key instead of the title of the actual piece so like here are some of my general articles and like here's the pdfs and stuff but i i find the site key to be less readable like hot couture bronze doesn't it yeah it's getting in the way yeah and like think of research it's getting in the way yeah yeah yeah so like if you know if if you're if you're an academic it absolutely makes sense to have everything formatted neatly but i'm not an academic i just want to know the title but i do have it as an alias and i do that because there's this nifty citations plugin that will basically query against your zotero database so if i am making a daily note i will do something like this where i will make a note to myself that i read this thing so for example i can insert a citation and then even if i haven't already made a note about it if i have a zotero entry so if it's something that i've dumped into my zotero even if it's not an obsidian yet as something other than a as a pdf this will let my backlinks work so if i do it with the origin the range of the link so it'll do it kind of this way which i don't love but i can like that's easy to fix right so now i have a link to the site key and that won't change so when i do get around to fully processing this note about the range of the eskimo lamp which is a laterally offensive title but note that it was written in like 1898 when i when i finished processing that note it will appear in my articles with the alias so that it would show up on the backlinks does that make sense a little bit i may have lost initially when you input that link and it had the at sign link so if we just take it back there where did that initially come from so you have somebody created a note it's just it's the citations plugin okay so this is an obsidian plug-in citations and this allows you what what is it doing by the way i i have it installed but i haven't played with it so the citations plug-in you're like oh i have to explain this i i expected this to be a lot of like oh right um which is why we're doing it this way where you ask me questions because i i could not possibly like do it as a walkthrough i've forgotten so many things that i've done so this will basically query against my list of site keys which is a json file that zop that the zotero will make for me so you have zotero you find this file this json file it's somewhere like you'll find it and then you tell it where to go there's a setting and cat's walkthrough covers this um so cat has a walkthrough which we will absolutely link to in the link of this description that will go through how to install all of this it's very like it's it's very broken down i didn't have any problems following it so that's one of the reasons that i don't want to like yeah so we won't go into the technical but yeah just if you're watching we'll have the link to la cats walk through but what we're doing is we're finding this this file wherever it exists and we're plopping it in here so we can uh communicate with zotero right yes and so like my zotero uses folders in my vault and i can show you that in a second and then the citation plugin you tell it where your literate literature notes go and then you can set up this template which i can probably yeah i can i can actually change that so it doesn't have that horrible little oh cool i watches eleanor is lazy and doesn't do things the way that she should do there so now it's just a psyche and in fact i can probably do it so that it links to the title instead i don't even have to worry about this that's so much more flexible than i realized i love it when that happens these plug-in developers are amazing yeah wow so this is this is really good i'm taking note of this like this is if you're watching take a screenshot right now because this is uh the stuff that then you can add to the citations plugin and see if that works for you yeah that's cool you could do all this neat stuff this is helpful i'm like two steps behind maybe even like 10 when it comes to this so it's nice to see how you're covering but please proceed with where you where you were yeah no to be clear i figured this out mostly like three days ago i want to set expectations this is nick and i figuring out how this works this is not a tutorial this is this is a showcase welcome to the uh welcome to the back end of things yeah the show-and-tell behind the scenes of nick and eleanor figuring out how things work all right so one of the things i did today was read through this hot culture bronze age thing i also read through this so let's look at this this like i said has the alias but this is how i got it this is my md notes default template and i will get into what md notes is in a minute things to note the alias is the site key which apparently i don't like super need but but i can see why it will be useful to have this because this is the thing that doesn't change like even if i go and like slightly mess with something it'll it'll be fine um and i actually don't need this anymore because i moved the date i like to have the date up here mostly for dataview um i there's a lot of information that academics use that i don't think is important like i don't need to know what journal this comes from i i don't care i don't know if that makes me a bad person but i don't care what journalist was published and i it's relevant for people who are trying to make sure that you know it came from scientific american and not something that's terrible it's relevant for people who are trying to figure out like you know what what journals like there are reasons to do it i just i the the longest hardest thing i had to do in order to make zotero work for me was getting rid of extra information not so much trying to find the information because academics care about so much more than i care about i just want my annotations the ability to go find it again and like a list of things uh i'm not sure if the recording will capture it but i i did a zoom clap because that's that's really important not to over metadata if you don't have the need you know there's the sense that oh i might need this someday maybe but that's the type of stuff that just drowns you out in noise and and false positives and distracts you whenever you're trying to work on something it's always there and it's like it's taking away energy so being able to whittle things away is a skill and it will serve you well so that's great to see that yeah so like i don't i don't need the abstract i don't need how many pages i don't need to know like which blog it comes from i don't need to know the isbn number i don't that's not important to me what is important to me is i can open it in zotero if i ever do need the metadata right like why you don't need to store your information in two places you just not not like not really i know you mean like that's a little bit silly because i'm obviously like storing my notes in two places but like for metadata yeah for metadata especially yeah i know what you mean like as a question of storage and then i can also click and just open my it shot up on the other screen but i can open the actual pdf if i want now there are a lot of cool things that you can also do you can tell it to give you and this is one of the things i actually deleted you can tell it to give you the location after every single block quote like it'll give you a link after everything to open up right into where in the pdf like which page it came from and and if you are someone not me maybe you will care to do that but i found it very messy and one of the things that i asked for help with was how do i make this go away interesting okay so like the the default is that it will open up in a like completely different like i i worked really hard to make it look like this but um the notes in in the default will give you the page number for everything and it will give you the it will give you after and it'll be a link and there's like a whole bunch of extra information but i i'm not like these are these are journal articles they're not that long knowing that it's on page 13 is enough for me like this is it goes from page 13 to page 19. i it was clutter so i just i wanted to get rid of as much clutter as i could and the other thing that i did to change it from the default was i added my handy-dandy headers i know you remember from last time i really like headers this does not ship with sort of the default exportation i had to figure out how to do that with a lot of very kind help and hand-holding from captain argentina in the discord seriously like the lesson that you take from this should be when you figure out exactly what you want yours to look like that's different for mine and different from cats just ask like just just ask like figure out what you can do and ask for help quick question hopefully this is an easy one to on that point when you're saying what it can look like are you changing it so the places you change it um the citations plug-in pop-up that you showed that that has like template-y stuff and then right here in the md notes default template is that is that where you're changing these things yes absolutely so i am the one that decided to make this look like this the actual md notes template the default ones um let me find it you know if i were if i were smarter i would have had this up already but yeah all right so here are the md notes templates that it sort of ships with you don't have to do anything with them if you don't want to like it it works out of the box what i did was a lot of customization so the the neat thing here is it comes with this empty notes default template and then i will split screen this so you can see how i changed it so normally it's just the title and then there's a bunch of like metadata that it'll make two different files for you and then it'll tell you the file names of all of that stuff and then it'll give you these zotero links so if you'll notice like i kept some of that right like i still have a title i still have the local library and then there's this notes thing is all of the like actual extracted annotations and stuff okay that's the default as you can see i super don't care about like the i don't want multiple files for this i understand why academics would but i like that's that's too that's too much for me for what i'm doing so normally it would come with all of this metadata here's the date and the date you downloaded and then the related things and here's like a bunch of extra tags and then here's all of the like here's the abstract and i i just i don't want that abstracts you're great don't get me wrong but i i prefer to write my own summaries because the things i care about are not the things that the researcher cared about like 80 of the time so this is pretty great so the way by the way that's a really cool get book that argentina set up but it's it looks like to me then that it's it's set up uh for the academic for the researcher which makes it which is fine yeah it totally totally but it has the flexibility built in where you just whittle away until you kind of find out what you need and so between between here and what eleanor has somewhere the truth lies for you like it you know or even further you know little way even more than what you put in here who knows but yeah you have that flexibility so that's cool i i see i actually feel quite empowered just knowing that how i can change the citations plugin and the md notes uh template yeah and there's a really great thing somewhere about the placeholders so here are all the pl here all the things you could have you can have whether like you can tell it is this a book is this a a journal article is this a website like it'll tell you so zotero lets you put things in collections they're uh they're like gmail folders they're like secretly tags but not officially tags by which i mean it could be in more than one folder at a time it's it's like the it's the perfect kind of folder it's like that beautiful in between of it acts like a folder and also acts like a tag it's what everything should be none of mine are in two folders because i'm a very hierarchical thinker we've met me right but but a lot of people would like put uh so sanitation and wastewater technologies in uh harappa and the indus valley like some people would put that in both harappa indus valley sanitation and infrastructure right like you could have collections for all of those things you could have and then also like bronze age and also like asia right like you could have collections for all of those things and that would make sense or or you could have um some people will have a collection for every paper they write and so it's like you might use the same article for multiple papers does that make sense it does okay good yeah it does yeah i mean for me it's the gmail labels and and how i use those label folders to to add multiple tag like label folders to each one so this is good okay i'm not sure where you're going to go eventually i'm curious where the site key comes in from zotero side but yeah oh okay so let's talk let's talk zotero for real not just my city involved right so zotero has this thing where it's an add-on which is is basically a plug-in so in order to make this like work you need to have three plugins you need better bib text is where you get the site key from and it like sort of automatically does some bibliography thing in the background that that is magic and does stuff and then there's zot file which does a lot of the um the pdf like so oh so the cool thing that zotero does um is there's a web clipper and with the web clipper i just go and say i want this in my list of stuff it's like a little it's a browser extension and then it will plop an entire website or article or i think you can even do it with youtube videos if that's not too meta maybe i'll try and like do it in one of the youtube videos [Laughter] and then it just it like it links up with zotero on your computer and it will just magically import it and rename it and pull all of the metadata for you like i i don't not i didn't i didn't find this stuff myself really i don't i don't care but it's useful to have like left to my own devices i would not take the time to actually fill in all of the things but it's nice to have the ability to just go to this url and then here's the like actual journal thing okay so i guess let's let's start from a new thing right so i'm gonna go find an interesting thing and this is um this is research rabbit i think it's still an alpha i'm gonna give nick a like invite code so that you guys can kind of jump the queue i think if you're interested but this is um this is something that i use to find articles that are related to books that i liked so i can sort of see who disagreed with them because i don't love the feeling of reading something that was written in 2010 and not realizing that sometime in the last 10 years the entire landscape of research has shifted it's not a great feeling i don't like it because i'm not an academic right and and research changes so fast and like the the state of play and like people just agree with stuff and like i just i like to know what the what the meta is so i can find um everyone that cited it 19 people cited this book i read and wrote an article about and let's see what we've got let's just export the whole thing and one of those things i know so little on the academic world but even though it's been cited a lot it doesn't mean anything because i i just i i guess when i was doing a lot of research into self-discipline slash willpower this was uh almost the better half of a decade ago there was this oft often often cited article like over 500 citations and it turns out that it could not be replicated reliably and it uh you know so you see that a lot i know replication is a problem so it's wild though to see all the citations that have been mentioned that easily uh it just this blows my mind by the way research rabbit you're pretty nice yeah and then so you get this you get what's called a dot bib file i don't know if you can see it i can see that okay so then literally all i do is i go into zotero and i one of these will let me import them so zotero i think being open source it's funny we have to install these plugins that seem to give it core functionality like better bib tech and um you know the other two at least better bibtex seems like it's a really should be baked into the core but you know for whatever reason it isn't it's open source though which is awesome that it's even a resource that's available okay so you found it is that it did it was it was in the file import like should i should have done that okay so not in here it's in my downloads boom so it'll make it into new collection which is useful and then uh this little pin means that the site the site key can't change so this is the site key that it gets imported with uh this is like what research rabbit like gave me you'll note that it's a different format than i used yeah uh oh which is fine that guy i'm gonna fix it but uh the reason for this is that like most people's site keys don't bother with the title it's like when you're writing a paper usually you just cite the author in the year because that's all you need in order to find it like this is sort of like what you would do in that little parentheses in i guess i don't know mla chicago whatever oh because this is a reference manager and like honestly what you're like most supposed to be able to use this for like i'm not using zotero for what it's for i want to be very clear zotero is good at automatically creating bibliographies and there's like a way to to like make it give you yes like you can get you can get it in in like you can copy the the like reference citation thing in chicago or apa like you can hear like that's what it's for just how nice like i don't know if you remember having to like format all of your citations and call it like didn't that suck yeah it sucked majorly right so like you can do that with a click isn't that amazing that's what zotero is for yeah watch as we continue to not use it properly not at all so that's why like all of the stuff that isn't baked in isn't baked in because it's not what it's for it's it's for put it like outputting all of your citations into whichever format the journal you're submitting to wants it in that's what it's for just okay that's fair that is fair yeah like it's meant for uh like i have a collection of every article that i'm using for this paper and then at the end of it i copy all of that and it out it spits out a bibliography to put it in that perspective yeah and if i were in college still or getting my master's degree or pursuing a phd or you know writing papers professionally that had to get submitted to articles you know like to journal like people who care about my sources absolutely that would be valuable but the people i am sharing my stuff with are happy with a link like franklin i you know i i cite my sources but i don't do it in a formal way i i do it with a link so i'm i'm able to ignore like 90 of what zotero is for and i imagine that most of the people who are doing the linking your thinking stuff or watching this or hanging out in obsidian are like not trying to have formal bibliographies for everything they do and caring about whether or not there's a distinction between the chicago and the apa and the mla styles so that's why this is the default site key but i prefer slightly more context because i don't care what fox did in 2000 like that's not meaningful to me so i like to unpin them and then you see how it just like magically formatted into a format that was that was like wow that was pretty cool you know i mean even even to have it display like that gives you a little tingle instead of just like a boof it's like it's like yeah you know you see it happening that's great i love it so unfortunately you'll note that these don't have these don't have pdfs they don't have any attachments and i'm going to pause here and note that i chose which things i want to see here so uh you you can change this like so all of these are journal articles but like i i don't find that useful a lot of people will find the publisher useful but i don't so like there are other things that you can add that i have chosen not to i care about the date i care about who made it and i like to have the psyche available to me and then the title it's funny the column is called creator that's like so not like writer or public well yeah because you can do youtube videos with this you can do you could probably do podcasts like it it's not just for academic papers you i did it with a website one of these is a website uh so you see how these have little icons okay this is a book uh this is a website this is a journal article i i don't watch any youtube videos i'm a terrible person sitting here making a youtube video i'm just not an audio visual learner no hey yeah like i i i know that's not how i process the free youtube's a funny place uh i have to say uh it's amazing how it's matured as a platform where if you want to find stuff that's educational you could i mean i understand learning styles and everything but it's it's really wild how if you get on the right if you find the right channels it's like whoa i'm learning a lot but um it's easy also to take that a little bit too far so tangent i actually i was i was watching a youtube video the other day and i i really was like i was excited about it it was it actually covered bronze age domestication of horses it was like i was ready and i was watching it it was really well done and all of the information came from a book i had just finished so i brought up commenting something like this is a great companion video to to whatever book it was it was uh i can tell you it was the domestication of something something is this one that was the horse the wheel and language by david anthony i was like this is a great companion video to that he was like yeah i got a lot of information from him it was it was a five-minute youtube video and a textbook this thick so you know like i i'm glad the youtube video exists just i'm i'm the kind of person who sat down with the with the textbook later on i i have to i have to point you to a resource that i found a lot of fun from but where they they take assassin's creed video game right um and one of the worlds explored like you know the city of alexandria and all these ancient cities and so they're talking about them in really uh sophisticated like historical terms they're using that imagery over yeah okay i've shown that in class i though the one for athens um i actually it's it's one of the things i introduce um greek democracy with and we do a whole thing where they have to pull out to and take notes on it and then talk about how they can use that as a as a source for uh making inferences about the nature of democracy increase it's like you're right it's a great resource i love it the assassin's creed people are fantastic i'm so happy that you uh that i understand it's being used uh yeah no i i've absolutely shown it multiple years in class uh it's it's it's a wonderful resource the the thing with pericles getting uh getting fruit thrown at him is his nice uh okay where were we zotero sorry sorry to the watchers for our incredible derailments but um so i don't know if this is going to work because i i didn't like pre-test this but uh i mean like i find available pdfs works but i don't know if these are open access but if you right click all of the the things from the bib bibliography file and find available pdfs it will just search the internet for you to see if any of them are open access and available the odds aren't always great because a lot of research is not open access and available so so this did find three open access pdfs which i think is cool so i'm going to move these into my open access collection i'm going to move the ones that are not open access into my restricted folder and then i'm just going to delete this collection because it's no longer useful so now we have a bunch of stuff this is in a language i do not understand so i'm going to delete it because it is not useful to me and then let me i should have done this a second so let's see what some of these were covenant international i think this one was israel and the assyrians zotero all right here we go this probably came from that utopian moment solomon the queen of sheba and the negotiation and the utopia and some other stuff okay so this is about negotiation probably in the bible and the cool thing that file did is this is now in my vault okay zot file we which i don't know if we've mentioned so we did better to bibtex we've done md notes citations and zot file right so it like from literally just from that bibliography file that i got off of research rabbit i i imported the whole thing into um into here and like you can go through and delete whichever ones you don't want and like you could have i i could have just unselected the right i was just proving a point so you pick which ones you want and then it'll make a big file of the ones that you checked so don't feel like you have to like i i could have done a better job of checking which ones were in english first but you know it's hard to think of everything when you're on camera hi folks so zot file um manages that for me i have given it my custom location which is my pdfs folder in my docs fault i have assigned the renaming rules so this is not what it was originally named as a pdf that file could then rename it according to the naming structure that i prefer using these i can't zoom in but it's the the percentage a like template thing it'll give you the the author last name you can use the year you can use the time you can use the journal there are um more things that they're they're called wild cards but like you can tell it how you want the name to be so if you want the pdf to be named the site key you can do that if you just want it to be the title you can do that if you wanted to be the title and the year you can do that if you want to add parentheses around the year you can do that very nice zot file is advanced pdf management for zotero it's true it's true it is it is moderately advanced i'm not going to lie to you yeah but but it's good so so you've settled on did did you switch up what your preferences are i just want the title i like it to just be the title by the author gotcha and uh wow it's right there all the pdfs are right there and uh obsidian do you so what do you do are we at the point where if i don't want to break the flow where you're at but what do you do with those pdfs within obsidian ah like in obsidian nothing but um i have a tablet and i have set my tablet to sync my vault because my my obsidian vault is um my it's like it's like a root thing in my documents like uh you can see like these are oh like i have my taxes and my obsidian fault like mine is it is like my root dropbox folder it's my everything like i i have i have my medical paperwork is in here like i i think the whole thing you have a full you have a whole folder for people you've dated i see so that's that's interesting no no no no no i'm kidding my uh so uh the reason that would have been plausible is that uh my husband and i joke i i tell time and boyfriends so i don't remember the year that things happened like oh yeah back when i was dating jeffrey oh yeah back when i was taking sean and now that my husband like have a baby he's like we're like we're gonna be married for a long time like eventually that like the dating system of one like you know of of which boyfriend you were dating in that you know one to three year period is not going to be a useful metric of when a thing happened and i was like oh but it's you know when our son was a baby and when he was a toddler and when he was in preschool like this is gonna work fine for me because i um i'm terrible at remembering numbers i like i it took me three or four years to remember my husband's birthday uh so it's like i don't know if something happened in like it's not oh yeah back in 2013 it's oh yeah when i was in law school let me do some that would have been 2013 okay it wouldn't it would have been like 2009 but uh but yes like i don't i just i'm not going to numbers gotcha there was a scenario in which i really did have a folder for people certainly not a not a root level folder but uh so um so i don't do anything with the pdfs and i'm saying i could people do um you you can absolutely embed a pdf uh open to the the page you want even in obsidian that is the thing that is possible there is even value in it uh you can you can like have it open to a page and then you can have meta data like notes in it if if you wanted like that would be great if the pdf had a bunch of pictures and like charts and stuff um but i i saw what i'm using upside down for i i've never like needed a chart and if i did i would probably just take a screenshot but um there are people for who it makes sense for so i want to mention that it is possible uh but what i do do is uh i will open up the pdf um that is in the correct folder in uh on my tablet or on my phone and i'll annotate and like take highlights and dictate and like i'll do all of that um and then it'll shoot back through dropbox i i think everything with dropbox and then on zotero what you can do is let me make sure that this is the one that's already exported references that dumps all right this is where i put all of like where they first come and then i move them to wherever it is appropriate so origins of agriculture in the near east already have and then i can sort it by which ones i have actually made notes for so let's see early pastoral economies these are my annotations like ipad or something yeah and i'll i'll actually do that right now so that you can see the whole process okay solomon among other things is a ladies man myself being a woman who is fascinated with solomon huh solomon's figure is a magnetic effect okay this is this is a good one i'm already like good job research rabbit i am intrigued do you have my attention that's an intro it is women who propel solomon's reign are not powerful in official terms but all right cool okay here we go i you this is a good one good job me i did not pre-plan this i have never heard of bathsheba whose influence in the kingdom proves to be one of the most pivotal in the course of the history of the davidic dynasty first appears in the text as a compromised situation her fate will either be that of great lady or that of the mother of a potential rival to the king okay i'm highlighting that because because i am interested in women of the bible and i am interested in the kinds of power women had in the ancient world this is relevant for phoenicia because ancient israel is a canaanite religion which is like a whole controversy i'm not going to get into but for my purposes is true enough and and probably relevant to my marriage mlc yeah you can see that i'm like obviously my pdf viewer does not have interlink capabilities but i am thinking ahead to how this is going to go into obsidian so there's my highlight i'm going to close my highlight make sure that it's actually there because i'm a paranoid soul yes i want to save it and then the way that i have this set up i can extract the annotations so you'll note there are no notes and then i can manage attachments and this is one of those three plugins i think yeah yeah right it's one of so that's one of the funny things with zotero this is one of the plugins after you you do it then you can right click and then scroll down and you find manage attachments and then you can hit this magic button magic button and it's doing something zop file okay yeah so it was that far that was that was the magic plugin so now i have the extracted annotations and you will note it does not recognize the header but like obsidian will so it's fine it formats it as a quote and then my annotation is down here at the bottom oh just real fast there so you said it does not recognize the header so on the back end of zotero you added the um the header like that so yeah right but mainly like long story short if you still extract annotations you'll get them they just uh you know they won't have that like the little three header hashtags no i'm going to show you how to do that as soon as i find it okay cool so 100 i'm going to show you i'm going to give you my code so uh i'm going to search that there okay here it is it was in zot file that's why i couldn't find it and this is much more human readable so if you look at the um the zot file format it will let you do some nifty stuff and i think there is even a way to do it with headers now i think the most recent update of md notes will recognize headers but obsidian will recognize three hashtags as a header so you can worry about that at your leisure and then i like the header to be the page number because it's helpful when i'm like linking to it when i'm typing it in uh it's a nice numerical sort of unique identifier and then it'll give me a new line the block quote and then the quote and then nothing else because this is just the highlights but if i do the dot file dot pdf annotation note it'll give it its own new line and then just the annotation and that these two things right here like you know right there that is the format of the annotation highlight and this part is actually pretty straightforward to change the the um the p is is something that shows up on mine so let me open it won't like you know the thing that windows does where you put it over here and it stays isn't that nice oh yeah it's not doing that for me so if you look there we go so if you look you can see um it it plops out as p6 so it's page six so the six is this uh little percentage symbol parentheses page the uh this html um what are these called the the equal to right yeah they're like pointy brackets they have a name the pointy brackets uh p is it's a paragraph so it makes it a new paragraph the block quote is uh the block quote formatting and then you just have to close the tags because it's html but it will pop out as markdown in obsidian thanks to md notes and so this is how i'm getting this format if you want to use a different format just rearrange the placeholders and the wildcards and the zot file has all of those wild cards that we talked about earlier so you could do any variation of this stuff that you want yeah i think there is what's so neat about that you had the block quote and then right underneath that is as your note so and i think this is so crucial because we're not just highlighting but we're commenting quickly i mean that that was a pretty pretty insightful comment that you have because you're linking to you know notes that you know currently exist but it could be like i don't agree with this or i want to look at this more but what you're doing is you you got peanut butter with the highlights and then your notes your comment that's the jelly and then how great is that to then bring in uh so i just think there's something special with having both like if you can get both at the same time that way and again it doesn't have to be as advanced as this one single example we're looking at it could be something super basic but you're putting a little tether or a cockle bur like something that can bring you back and and tie you into what that highlight meant to you yeah and in fact i'm going to tag this biblical because that will be useful for me later i'm just just looking at my note i was like oh i should probably mention that this is all biblical and i could i could you know do do tags too but actually i'm going to because i talk about dynasty sometimes and then i can later use that tag uh to plop it into a like when i'm looking for dynasty stuff so i correct me if i'm wrong but have we seen now i'm sure this is the next step that you're about to just say next step but this then goes into obsidian or maybe it already has somehow no it hasn't yet okay that is the next step that is what i was reaching over here to do so md notes which is one of the extensions that you should install absolutely follow cat's thing before you watch like if you haven't done that already like i don't know what to i don't know how to help but um so you can uh i'm pretty sure it's it's i want to make it as a single file there are you'll have options i personally prefer to have it as a single file so it will open up my folder just to confirm like if you don't want it to go into your normal folder you can change it every time there's probably a way to disable that but i i like the redundancy and then it makes a markdown file magic so it will create a link to the markdown file it's opening it like typora is my default um that i don't open very often and you know that's that's some stuff it's not very pretty in typora because typhoid doesn't recognize yaml but in obsidian my dot dumps folder i now have this i'm not sure why that did that and it's not like perfect i probably should have renamed the title and i would probably but this is this is this error is because i was demonstrating that you can make it a header that's not its fault i did that that's my mistake yes and then you know there's a little bit of cleanup sometimes i like to remove the empty lines there's probably a way to fix that flow my priority list but like it's probably when you have to delete one of those yeah yeah you can you can probably delete one of the new lines in the content thing i just haven't bothered uh but i can open the doi file good okay can we go back i just want to comment on how how beautiful that quote box is wait i mean that's really nice uh definitely i know you i think you shared the css code somewhere i will i'll give you a link for the for the thing at the bottom that one is quite nice yeah it's it's handy because it just works really well next to your thoughts you know we can definitely see the distinction yeah i think it's important to um oh that's funny ha it doesn't change size remind me to let um remind me to let somebody know about that i gotta fix that look at that do you see that it doesn't change size when you zoom funny i've never noticed um yeah so and the the site thing is my my code too uh it wouldn't normally do the pretty little underline bar and i know that a lot of people really hate my font but it's really similar to my to my actual handwriting so i find it useful so usually i will go through and i will like further process this um by making a heading like it doesn't just say the name so for this case i would probably do something like bathsheba was powerful and rather than make you sit through me do a whole thing with this here's one that i have already processed that's a lie i thought i'd already processed this this one i've already processed so it is something that i do myself to give these heading titles and that's sort of the the atomic part i guess like that's where i get the like small like this is what this says this is what this says tyrion purple doesn't need as many snails as people think here's my proof but like here's the here's the tldr right here's some stuff about cell clouds out of china here's how palace um textiles were created in palaces which was specialized much earlier than previously believed it's not a long thing it was it was long when i read it but this is all the stuff i care about it's much more easy to do in this format and then the summary is not the abstract right the abstracts are like always long it feels like maybe i'm wrong here's a one sentence summary of the important takeaways and then i link to the two sort of most important things that i thought were most important at least okay and purple this is like this is sort of the what i learned tyrion purple doesn't need as many snails as people think do you know what you probably don't want to talk about i'm intrigued though so uh tyre was one of the um one of the really important cities in the eastern mediterranean and their big uh trade good historically speaking was purple uh purple dye so you probably heard of imperial purple and you're probably familiar with the fact that like wearing purple was a sign of royalty and part of the reason for that is that in the ancient world um this like very particular shade of of purple slash red it's like tyrion red serum purple it's like a really rich imperial purple color um was was made from like the shells of these tiny snails that that lived in the eastern mediterranean near the city of tyre and they had figured out how to like turn them in to die in this incredibly intensive process but uh it's like they've recently learned in roughly 2007 so like not that recently but from the perspective of all of the years of history that have that we've had this notion about syrian purple it doesn't need as many snails as you think because you can sort of like cut the dye you can like you can it doesn't have to be pure in order to get the color gotcha gotcha very cool and for a long time they thought uh oh there's a there's a person in this painting that that is wearing a purple dress so it it absolutely must be that they traded with tire and they were very wealthy and extravagant and that's just like sort of like there are other ways to make purple and like it just i don't know so okay this is interesting yeah this is part of the debate yeah that ties back to art history and you know the use of different things uh gold i think or blues even i think there was a maybe it's i'm no expert on that stuff but same idea that if that color was used it meant you know royalty it meant spirituality it meant something or i mean supernatural yeah yeah yeah exactly so it was really interesting to have the sort of counter current in the information that i have about dyes and i actually this was the moment that i put together my moc i haven't even made the description yet dye is how you color clothes don't mind me and i haven't done a lot with it but i have just enough that it was worth sitting down and being like oh what do i know about dye because i have written about diet for my newsletter before and in fact it was because of brian shanks that i wrote this newsletter because he has uh he has custom dyed um wool gloves and when i wrote my thing about wool he uh wrote back to tell me about his really nifty wool gloves and inspired me to to do a little bit more digging into ancient eyes very cool that's how my stuff evolves subscribers email me and tell me cool stuff and then i find other research about it and then here we are thanks zob file so it's yeah i don't know it's just it's there's a lot of interesting knowledge in the world and i try to keep it organized and put it together and make insights and eventually this will probably become something useful and then you know get wrapped into like maybe a book in my maybe a story i write will have a character who makes dies professionally one of the other interesting things i learned from this was that textile creation was specialized earlier than everybody thought we have this notion that guilds sort of came about in the middle ages and that in ye olden days like in sort of the bronze age prehistoric eras you know everybody spawned all of the women like sat in their houses and spun wool but like there was actually a lot of specialization in working together and we have proof of that thanks to this sort of 2007 dig into the minoan island of something there i learned stuff and it was cool and the cool part was it took me like no time at all to get all of that into my um into my obsidian vote i want to be clear when i first found obsidian i was using actual physical books i was manually typing all of my actual physical annotations [Music] hopefully you got some value out of this exploration into using a reference manager like zotero in your knowledge
