[Music] hey eleanor how are you doing i'm pretty good i'm excited i there's so many things that have happened to you and in the last couple of months yeah and and here we are catching up live like yeah that's just your face yeah you too it's kind of kind of funny to catch up like on a live stream so yeah yeah so we're gonna keep this pretty informal but i guess i'll try to do it like a partially formal intro right now just to say uh hey i'm nick milo uh this is eleanor koenig um i guess we're both involved in the obsidian community and in the broader world of personal knowledge management or you know link-based thinking in different ways so we decided to kind of catch up live and each show each other a couple things there's also the chat which is kind of cool because i can see oh there's danny hatcher so we can throw up little comments like that and do things which are pretty cool so we'll be doing that from time to time but yeah so how are you doing on this sunday morning um just barely afternoon yeah i'm over here on the east coast and my son went down for a nap early so i'm having a great day that's good that's good it's always nice when there's a little down time i mean i could i would imagine in your in your world just a little but enough i i had a nice time i've been messing around with the leaflet plugin which i've been meaning to get to for ages because i have maps that i've been using for my world building and i like this plugin has existed for ages i've known about it but i've i've always been just like that tiny bit oh there's something else more important i finally got to the point where no like leaflet was the most important thing on my list so i messed around with it and ran into some problems and i'm now waiting for somebody to help me which is my usual mode of operation i always run into problems it's my superpower yeah okay well that's that's good i'm curious about leaflet because i know it's powerful but uh i think we'll just kind of go around the horn a little bit so before we jump into maybe sharing screens i'm just kind of curious uh some quick updates uh where are you adding in your world like last last we checked uh you've been doing the obsidian roundup for people that don't know and that seems to have really caught on yeah i guess i guess it has been a while um so i'm i'm like 90 almost definitely going to quit teaching uh the state of teaching in my state is kind of dicey and the state of the roundup is like really important to me and i am at a position where i'm lucky enough to where i have some runway because we hadn't really planned for me to go back to work until august so the the fans and you know people who get something out of you know either of my newsletters i have a the kind of tech newsletter for the obsidian community but also a newsletter where i round up um like world building research so obscure history weird science and i have that newsletter and i didn't really intend to go all in on the creator economy but i started looking around to reapply for jobs um with the county and started talking to some of my friends who are still teaching and it's the class sizes are very high and the tech solutions that they're using are very bad and the teacher shortage in my region is [Music] very stressful so uh and with with my son i wanted to kind of be in a situation where i wasn't working 50 and 60 hour weeks and stressed out from being expected to do the job of two people so i'm i'm having a lot more luck i guess emotionally with um doing consulting so i've been i've been helping companies with using obsidian i've been helping people with using obsidian and i've been thank you and i've i've been sort of doing the roundup on a like kind of donation basis but also i've been writing more articles that are designed to help people with things that i don't think many people in the personal knowledge management space are addressing not like not because anybody is doing a bad job just like you and i have different focuses you know like everybody has their own thing and mine tends to be sort of counter cultural like i try to be the voice of all right everybody has this advice and this is good advice for 80 of people but i try to be the voice of that 20 of people who like the normal advice doesn't really make sense for and and connect more other stuff so like if 80 of people are hypothetically college students or professionals who are using it to be managers that i try to be the voice of oh but there are also these people who are using obsidian in a completely unrelated way to be authors or to be doctors and i try to those sort of like niches that that aren't blockbuster things i try to be that voice and i'm i it's really important to me and and it's been wonderful to have people supporting that stuff that's what i've been doing that's pretty amazing on multiple fronts for one i i mean selfishly i'm really happy to hear that you might not have to go back to teaching just because that means that there'll be more of you here um and i'm really really happy for that because uh you know this this whole uh i don't you said creator economy but knowledge management um adjacent world that we we where we overlap at least i think it needs um certain we're like people you can kind of trust to some degree i think um you know you can always be a little skeptical but it's just nice when you know somebody and you kind of understand where they're coming from and uh but yeah it's really interesting just to hear where you're at i guess just quickly on my end we just wrapped up a workshop for linking your thinking it was it was really great um had just over 200 people and we had just over 50 that did a end of the workshop showcase where they get so uncomfortable they get outside their comfort zone they actually share their screen they open part of the garage door and they say hey check this out um and sometimes it's it's nothing you know like amazing to to mention and other times it's like whoa what did you just do um but no matter what we all learn from it because it creates new associations in our mind and gosh it is it's just a really exciting exciting time i think our showcases are so important because they show people different use cases they're not like like as a teacher right like putting on my teacher hat there's an enormous difference between i am teaching people how to do this thing and this is 30 students who have created examples like it's showing people how to do something the way that you do it is one very important step that's like what i do and then there's the you do and the we do but the the exemplars really are the part where with my students it makes clear to them the possibilities yes and the the range of possibilities and where there is room for freedom and adjustment and it's critically important and it's very difficult to do um you know as a content creator because it it requires that community that you have built so i i'm i'm thrilled it exists thank you for curating that particular kind of excuse me that particular kind of community yeah well it kind of just it formed itself but what's so nice is like you said there are so many different people doing different things and uh i it really blew my mind early on i thought i was like yeah this is just this is how you handle information and i was coming from a more uh i guess rigid workflow even though is with links i guess it's all relative it was still pretty pretty uh flexible but it was still kind of rigid and then when you got when when obsidian started to blow up it brought in all sorts of people like you know the doctors and the dungeon masters as i was saying recently but um it's it's so true and anything is possible so learning from somebody who is a dungeon master it's like hey i might not be doing dungeons and dragons but i can learn from that and actually apply something that can help me out specifically for what i'm doing and uh so it's a really fun time right now i feel like we're in one of those really vibrant estuaries where the river meets the ocean and there's like all sorts of vibrant wildlife happening there i feel like that's what's happening in our knowledge management of the world of knowledge management really but anyways i'm kind of curious if maybe we get over to some screen shares yeah so um and i see a question on the sidebar to to answer your question grace our goal was a brief catch-up and then i'm going to showcase something that nick hasn't seen where i have a different kind of workflow that i've been talking about a little bit in obsidian so less of the tutorial and more of a showcase um i mostly don't do tutorials nick does but i mostly don't um and then nick is going to show me something cool that he's been working on that he's been very cagey about that i'm very excited about and then we're going to loop back around i'm going to show you one more cool thing that i've done that i hope will continue to get built out in the community and then quite honestly make i forget what the rest of the plan was but to give you an idea of where this is going that's the broad section and we'll stop for questions so think of it more as a showcase in q a and a little bit of catching up and less of like a tutorial where we teach you things as though i am teaching yeah does that well yeah well said and that's basically it we've we've done the ketchup and now it's like you share then q a i'll share q a then you share again then we'll probably be around uh you know wherever we want to go we can take it from there but yeah all right well i guess pop my screwdriver and nick this is going to be recorded and uploaded right yeah somewhere okay yeah i think i i don't know nick handles all of that that's why i love working with it yeah it's live on youtube right now and it'll be there afterwards okay cool the amazing world of software i know pop me up oh sorry i have to do that there are buttons to be pushed so i basically have two modes of note taking in the the ways that kind of matter to other people the first is the one we've already talked about where i take a long book or an article and i take notes by highlighting and annotating i import them i process them i mostly use revise but i have some other methods as necessary and then during my second pass over the content i process them i make claim statements that use each like highlight as the reference point and then i make atomic notes based on the things that i highlighted and annotated and then i organized that into a kind of gestalt literature note book review type thing that's we've talked about that before i've got an example up um so like this is tamed by alice roberts and then i should have gotten water uh so you can see i've got these different notes let's do comments do this and then i can bring these over if i'm working on something sure enough yeah shut off a little bit but um so what i what i will very often do is if i'm writing a review i will open all of them up and then as i integrate them i will close them when i am done with them and then when i don't have any more pop-ups on my screen i'm all good to go and i know that i have processed all of my notes and i find that super useful because they're like off to the side and not a bunch of pains like i know that sliding pains is what you use but sliding pains a little bit give snap could you process one like i mean like a fake process just i'm just i'm curious sure so more so just um so we can see what happens to the note or the content yeah so here's more time then here's dogs were domesticated before agriculture right this is a claim statement that i made based on the there's a quote somewhere um and then in the actual like article i will reference that so this is my review where i'm going through and making sure that i touch on everything and and then once you have so like here's the quote i would kind of rephrase that in my gestalt okay and then does it stay in the outline or how did you say you checked it off i closed the hover thing so guys you see how when i closed that pain my whole screen kind of jerked maybe you see how my like the pains are getting rearranged oh sure like the location of them with the hover cards nothing gets rearranged when i'm done with it i just close it i see okay and like that seems like such a little thing like i know it seems seems silly but those kinds of things where my screen's not getting jerked around anymore yeah it makes it easier for me to work um so like i no i just really like it i don't know how to sort of phrase it but this is one method that i use um and danny i reference mostly by doing comments that are links didn't like that so that when it's on preview they don't show up so that when i copy and paste and publish it it's not there i do very little with footnotes i do stuff with backlinks but less with references and more just so i can find it again but the um other way i take notes is one that i've never actually talked about with you i have a more targeted evoke sometimes more targeted approach sometimes sorry very often i will sit down and i will write a newsletter my newsletter will consist of say armor i will be interested in coming up with a kind of fantasy armor and i will be working on a story about the cult of valor and i'm like golly i should describe these people what do they look like i don't know what kinds of armor should they wear i actually know very little about armor so i will sit down and say to myself i should get some inspiration about armor from history what's the weirdest armor that has existed in history and why oh uh thanks danny there screen sharing notification is gone uh so i will kind of very often take notes in my newsletters that's the whole reason i started writing the iceberg long before i found obsidian was to organize my notes on these topical deep dives so you can see here i have all right pangolin scales cool that's useful armadillos cool that's useful assyrians were the first ones to have textile armors cool that's useful so i will organize all of these notes into a newsletter and mostly that works the whole like my whole system is designed around that like working but every now and then i will stumble across a interesting but not relevant thing that i want to use later so for example when i was working on this arbor newsletter i came across some interesting information about pangolins which i swear i can spell pangolins came up in an article i was reading and it turns out that pangolins are not the traditional food of this island which has nothing to do with armor whatsoever right like that is interesting pea fowl or traditional food on this place that has myths about excuse me about pangolins cool i didn't want to lose that i could do something with that very specifically i could do a whole twitter thread about this kind of traditional food i didn't expect to know about and have it be relevant to my newsletter about cuisine which is like a a very large area of insta for me i've been collecting unusual foods i've actually done a um [Music] so i'm kind of curious in that p file not pangolins uh what your metadata is that's pushing you to other places so you have the cuisine note uh-oh [Music] i think there's some technical difficulty i don't know if it's on my end or on eleanor if it's on your end wondering if youtube comments can tell us we got it we're back are we back i think we're back i think we're back if we're not back somebody tell us okay um cool sorry about that hi everybody yeah so i'll be back okay i'm just going to assume that we're back and somebody okay thank you lee uh food history weird weird cuisine interesting cuisine the things i didn't know related to food isn't interesting so i knew i wanted to take this vote pangolins are relevant to armor but foul being like relevant to hunting and feeling things about hunting that's not really relevant but i wanted to take the note so i took the note and i tried to leave myself this metadata these bread problems of hey my plan is to use this as twitter and i have a tag for that for supporting and kind of like raising awareness that hey i have this little note or i have this newsletter check it out hey eleanor um i for some reason well good question is your audio is cracky so i'm curious if my audios crack correctly as well so anyone in the comment can let us know real fast um it's flickering a bit yeah is is my audio as well if anyone in the chat can let us know um okay so it might be on your end internet connection wise yeah we did a tech check i promise but maybe yeah because we did it we did it tech check so apologies for that i'm gonna ask my husband to get off the wi-fi yeah yeah tell him tell him to get off sorry guys okay no worries in the meantime everyone let's look on the screen real fast because what i'm curious there are a couple things happening on that far left note which is the the link to cuisine and then they're the broader and broader that might take us down the breadcrumbs rabbit hole so maybe we stay away from that but i am essentially i was curious because you went to cuisine when i thought you were going to link outward to pangolins like there was a choice i think at one point because you started with this random note people are not or not pangolins are this traditional cuisine so i was thinking you were going to go into the land of pangolins and maybe like accumulate knowledge around that or something but instead you ended up going to cuisine and i can't i'm just kind of curious where we go from here so there's all these choices right i could have done the penguins it was used for armor but i happened to know him that it was a less interesting rabbit hole because those are my notes um i've mostly always done some armor but the quiz scene is related to all of these other things that i've done and with the hey hover plug-in hey eleanor we're still we're still getting the chop so one idea is that if you're able to restart something or other i don't know what my router might be like if i start my router it's going to [Music] yeah let's do the the computer restart uh i can try let's try the computer restart i'll i'll try to like dance around and keep people's interest yeah and then yeah sorry guys i like i don't know i've never had this happen uh i'll restart and see what happens yeah okay i guess it's just me um so at this point we're using stream yard which links into to youtube and it's my second time using it so i think we're just still working out the bugs if anyone's familiar with stream yard we'll figure it out in the meantime are there any questions are there any questions that you might want to throw into the chat now or or where we could go i do want to share my screen but i also want eleanor to see so i might give it a second let's see in that case i might see can you elaborate on the six c's they're actually seven c's um but let me see what i can pull up around the c's so in the meantime eventually i'm going to share something on this and um but let's see if i can pull up something on seven fees oh that's good i don't want to go there just yet but um let me share another screen share screen one second and i chose i guess i'll start a little early on the seven seas just to talk a little bit about that all right so sharing my obsidian window yeah this one shall do okay so we're talking about accretion a little bit later and there are some c's if you ever encounter some sort of concept that you find interesting uh trying to make a mnemonic so i made the seven c's of note making and these are a few of the c's each of them have a prompt and you can go through these prompts to kind of figure out how to make sense of something in this case i was curious about the word accretion because it seems similar to accumulation but it's also different so i wanted to kind of figure out those differences so this is something i did elsewhere but let me make this bigger there are a few prompts and the first one is connect so the first thing i want to do after creating the note is to connect it and so within this note i'm trying to make connections and one of the most powerful prompts that i find in existence is this reminds me of and then i might also say it's related to and really important is a forcing function to say the most relevant link for me is blank and that becomes the top link or the actual linking your thinking link and that usually will go at the top of this note so this is the before eventually we'll see the after oh we have eleanor back excellent so let's do it let's um pause this one for now and we'll we'll close this loop in a second so let me remove that how are you doing i don't know am i back you're better you're better i i'm sorry i don't i don't know what was going on um stuff happens so but what what i saw on your screen looked like a really great segue into your question which was you were asking about how i have this broader stuff at the top can i share your window yes yes absolutely um so i do something very similar where instead of your method of what does this remind me of i kind of do that more informally i am somewhat less structured and and neat and early than you are which is funny no no no no no no i didn't get my disclaimer i don't i don't use this but it's for training wheels yeah yeah exactly like i i do that i do that kind of thing in my head of have i made sure to remind myself why i'm taking this note so i took this note because i want to use it the next time i'm writing a twitter thread when i have time to write twitter threads which is not as often as i would like um this is in the broader category of unusual foods this is in the broader category of animals it is this this is why i took this note here's the most relevant part and here is a link to the file so like i give myself basically the bare minimum of information i need to use this again when i am not busy while the actual project that i was doing english was writing that arbor newsletter right i didn't have time to go down this completely separable because i had a deadline for my newsletter about armor which was again originally designed to help me decide on what kind of armor the cult of other people were going on the danger of rabbit holes is that like what if i had gotten very distracted by writing this that i have about mm-hmm yeah yeah i don't know it's a it's a little difficult it's really it's really chopping you up there eleanor um it's almost decipherable but it's like right on the edge which is makes it a little difficult and you i know you're not using safari and i know how frustrating that is because then you can't speak without like it just doesn't work so i'm not quite sure what we want to do uh eleanor i feel so bad yeah can you turn can we turn my camera yeah it seems like it's the same it um maybe we need to restart eleanor's chrome then well she raised i mean you restarted the computer that would have i can try it in firefox i don't know like is this i don't know enough about this the streaming software it's a no it's clear again it's clear again maybe let's try one more time without the video just to see um it might be that my wi-fi can't handle all the things that the streaming service is asking of it like like normally zoom compresses we've always done a num zoom before i'm wondering if this isn't doing enough compression because my like i'm on wi-fi i'm not hardwired it could be but you are good now i will say that um seems like it's probably that it's probably because we're trying to push through too many things through my wi-fi mm-hmm uh i think so i guess we'll just give it you won't see my my lovely hand gestures but it should be fine i like to think while you're presenting and then we'll just go this this view while you're presenting yeah so if anybody has any advice on how to troubleshoot this please let me know but otherwise my apologies i swear we did a tech check um yeah all right we're back into exploitation histories of pangolins yes back into your penguins so the the idea is i am not i'm not really trying to get distracted going down this rabbit hole of taking these notes about this thing i found while doing some thing totally different um if you knew where my router was you would know why i don't have a network cable but so the moment that maybe really worked for me were these little icons and their data pass icons if you look you can see that it's just markdown like it's just a box this is mapping yeah you know eleanor we might have to punt this um yeah um let me can we can we put an hour we could go and i can hardwire myself to something and see if that helps yeah or we could we could go on zoom and um provide everyone here at zoom link yeah let's just switch the zoom okay we'll put a zoom link so it won't won't be like a live stream for youtubers but um i think uh dan is going to be providing us a uh zoom link so everyone who's on this youtube feel free to to jump into the zoom that's going to be provided in the chat here so um that's going to be provided recently or pretty shortly and it'll be thrown into the chat it's weird it's almost like when you get more sorry and it's like when you get more animated it stretches the bandwidth too much that's a good it's it's a strange theory i don't know enough about wi-fi to have i don't know if you give me a zoom link i will hop into zoom i'm so sorry everyone we really did test this yeah um dan dan is my right hand man dan is the man dan lardy he's part of linking your thinking i think it's amazing yes yes so before we do anything we're switching to a headset i have a good feeling about that because i think it's like the mic being overloaded if we had an audio technician they probably know what it is but it does feel as though it's mic related and interference so whoever was it star belt who threw that one in there can you hear me sounding pretty good does that is that better it is it is okay let's try this for like a minute and then we'll see if maybe the problem was my mic it shouldn't be interference with the mouse because they're both hardwired but yeah no this is better there's a little bit of uh feedback let's go with this and i'm going to be silent because i think there's a little bit of feedback from me but other than that go for it i think we're good um i'm glad everyone has actually stuck around um really appreciate that and anyways take it away illinois back to where you were okay exploitation histories of pangolin i'm going to try the camera and see what happens is this chaos is this worse can you see me now can you hear me now yeah oh god okay i don't i i want to be clear the mic i was using is a professional hardwired mic that is literally attached to my computer and a foot from my face this is a six year old gaming headset that is not hardwired to anything so you know what anyway hi that was awkward pangolins are cool sometimes i take notes about things that are not my actual research project and i've been using these data task icons to very quickly take quick notes and show myself this is where in this list your link is this is where in this list the quote is it's very handy i like it because i was actually working on something completely unrelated i was working on taking notes about art so when i i was writing a story about the cult of valor i could describe them your turn nick that's good oh my god well thank you all right well thanks you can pass it over my way and uh i'll share my bit and then we'll kind of see where we're at we're starting to get a little bit of that buzzing again it's it's crazy so um maybe i'll share my bit and then we'll do after hours on zoom for whoever else is yeah sounds good okay so in the meantime we're um there's a link so we're not going to use this link yet but i'm just going to get it into the chat so it's started or dan if you're able to the un unseen dan he's here though if you can throw that in the live stream chat the zoom link we'll get there eventually i'll just um i'll start sharing a little bit uh okay so i don't okay when talking about note making a lot of people are not familiar with the term or don't know where to start so my goal was to provide a helpful framework for them and that framework became the seven cs of note making and so do i i won't use this all the time but this was an example that kind of seemed to make a lot of sense so actually using accretion for this um this is a word i wanted to learn more about and so the first c is you create the note and then it's created and so then c2 is the connect this is the first thing i want to do with any concept in my world and it's going to be different for other people but it's just to make the connections and so i'm trying to figure out prompts um and the most uh my most valuable prompt is really this reminds me of and that that usually will spur some connections so i just wrote some stuff willy nilly and then i can go on to the next one and say let's clarify this so what is this thing so i actually start with the connections before the clarifying as part of this um mnemonic device to to go through because the most important thing isn't so much that we have clear definitions initially for me it's truly about making connections once there's a little bit of a something that's connected actually i can use the connections to further clarify so here's just me writing about what accretion actually is what is it so i'm trying to answer that and say why it's important to me and kind of go through those next one um color my favorite it would shout so um something that i love doing with this eleanor is just with any concept is i try to personify it and i am kind of proud of this one because i don't think it i haven't seen it anywhere else but i try to personify any of these concepts so in this one accretion would shout i use gravity to build that's what accretion would say and then we go to the critique so this is that analyzing mindset we can put on like the analyzing hat i forget the color like the black hat i think after we just got done with the green the green hat this is green hat territory now we put on the black hat and you know i start working in this way and answering these prompts creates new insights and and wild things now i'm thinking about memes accretion is making me think about memes so that's kind of interesting so i just make a note of that and then i finish with like trying to cite where does this come from and i just throw in a little something from wikipedia okay great so these are the seven c's of note making create go through these and then i get to the last one which is curate and throw all this stuff and then make something out like put it together in a better form which is what this this note has become and so in the same way that you have your placeholders and it's really cool because we have you know different workflows but in this but there's some overlap with things that we're trying to accomplish for me yeah the principles are similar yeah yeah so um so i reshuffle things and curate and now i have a note that allows me to link out to other things now the thing i wanted to show you though was accretion with ideas themselves not just the name of like we're going really meta here so um and one is unrequited notes and i want to give a shout out to pat hope who took who took um did you finally start using data munich only just a little bit yeah just a little bit i remember when i remember when i showed you when dataview first came out and we were like mind blown by the idea of using it for maps of content at all how the world moves well they both serve different purposes so i agree i agree that was the conclusion we came to but it's just fun to see you using it yeah because i put the distinction like this use mlcs to generate insights use data scopes to analyze information not to say that they can't overlap but in general they're totally different things yeah they're totally different things it's just fun to see you using it yeah um yeah so it's definitely a nice tool within this kind of i mean everything becomes i don't want to go too philosophical so i'm going to avoid that for now but anyways unrequited notes what are these exactly so these are notes out there that link to accretion but accretion doesn't link back to them it doesn't mention them so slightly different than a typical backlink and this is great for research because i can throw in notes if i'm trying to research on accretion and i can just make sure it links to accretion and when i come into this note to process things i can see oh what are some other notes i haven't gotten to yet and then i have this list waiting for me this isn't the best example because they relate this i mean it's just a random concept but then something else was these associated tags which is another way to allow ideas to accrete around this so anytime on i use the prefix on and then i can pre add anything so on accretion and then any other tag that exists i can make sure that it links back to this note so this is the bad example from today but i just grabbed some stuff from online that were related to accretion do a couple other things here and once you get comfortable you're not there you don't like sliding pants but for those who do like sliding pins you can just quickly move your notes around and it's beautiful this is all just keyboard me working with the keyboard right now just moving stuff around do you have pain relief yes i have pain relief yeah and it's great okay so really quickly i'll get down with it but um what you can do like you know these are different sources online that i just grabbed before this call and one what i would likely do is just do one mention of it right here and i would just hit accretion oh there it is i hit enter and if i go back to this note whenever i'm ready i can resurface ideas in context because this one's now waiting for me because it has this tag can you hit your edit mode for your data view yeah thanks oh you like you totally even just flipped over to source mode didn't you oh yeah somebody's got a hotkey for that i have not yet made a hotkey for that i need to oh yeah i i mean i'll just share this in the for what it is again i don't know if i finish my shadow but yeah pat hope from he took the light workshop but he's a student at stanford university and he had something quite similar to this uh he didn't call it unrequited or whatever but it's the same concept with it's slightly different than backlinks because you can have you know you can just compile research of things pointing to this note or in this case associated tags which i think is really helpful because then you already have this stuff ready to go it's like you had with your outline so again there there's different ways to i don't want to use that crazy expression skin the cat i don't know why i come from but maybe that's part of your research we can learn from that so many rabbit holes to go down yeah but essentially i just wanted to kind of share this because what i could end up doing is if i did you know do some refactoring then in this note then i can just quickly throw in i'm just going to make this not clean not trying to do anything impressive out there but i'll just throw in the link here and i know whenever i'm back in this note i have these associated notes ready for me to work into my broader understanding of this concept now that might seem pretty abstract when it's called accretion but if it's called my phd research paper and you're compiling all these associated sources and you know they're there and then when you incorporate them it's quite easy to if you wanted to just to get rid of the tag then this will automatically update it's no longer there i can put that back so just trying to show some ways to allow the technology to allow slow burns oh here i'll finish with this eleanor and then i swear i'm done look at okay one of these associated tags is um a little presentation so what we're doing is trying to build call cognitive scaffolding so your ideas can accrete why why do this and it doesn't just support our active thinking it supports our future thinking and i'll give you three metaphors i'm curious which one you'll like the most astrophysics so notes can accrete gravitationally in orbit around a topic like the dust around saturn in the rings and they grow in mass and gravity or we can choose fire notes are thrown into these slow burns until there's enough fuel for a fire to break out or seeds notes are seeds that you plant so you can cultivate them in the future or you can choose your own but there and then i go into some other things but yeah just wanted to share that all right i'm done it's delightful i actually haven't seen slides used um very often with obsidian which is unfortunate because that was cool yeah but uh i i think i like the astrophysics metaphor the most but see for me it's not like if i i do something very similar right like i tend to use god i can't believe i'm gonna say this i tend to use bullet points in an outline format more than just putting it all out there in long form dumping of the information which i cannot believe those words are coming out of my mouth i feel like i have betrayed my origins but um with these data task bullets that i've been doing which would show up um it's actually not a plug-in it's it's just css they work on the minimal theme the primary theme its sanctum and some other ones but i've i've gotten to this habit of marking them with the icons because when i look at your screen like it makes sense to you right you're the one that put it there but i don't trust future me to remember the context i kind of see like wall of text i'm just like all right that's that's a lot of text um like again i can't believe i'm saying this because i am the queen of wall of text but those little icons are so helpful for this is the link this is the quote this is my idea that is related to it and i break those out into those sections which um you can you can change them too like minimal the the repository for the minimal theme has scss hidden um in like one of their folders and you can add your own icons it's pretty easy if you go to like the iconify website so i'm i made one that looks like a little push pin can we try to see that again without overloading the system can i re can we reshare yours hold on um probably let me yeah all right let's try okay wow my mouse is jerking oh that must be the uh zoom window oh yeah sorry i was getting prepared for that i'm going to stop my camera because my mouse is freaking out but um so like this note is the one that i added cool and it's just these are the codes for it and it's just like you don't have to do any kind of plug-in thing it's just part of core part of core for sanctum and minimal so far so the the the functionality is part of like core obsidian the ability to have this be a thing that can be targeted with css and then you have to actually target it with css and it's built into several themes there's also a snippet several snippets floating around i can probably find a link when i have somewhere to put it i'm actually not logged in and i don't know how to make comments in the chat but if somebody can like go to the minimal repo and put the like check boxes css link up that would probably help um because i'm seeing some questions about it but it's i find it very straightforward and again i cannot believe the words i am using this in outliner format are coming out of my mouth but these little icons make it super super easy to parse a bunch of like dumped here's all of my notes about this topic here's all of my notes about this topic i will come back to this later when i'm not doing something completely different so let's sound very helpful you have your quotes and then what about the annotations or because i know you do that you have that workflow with the direct quotes but then the ones that you've kind of paraphrased i'm just kind of curious um how you're handling let me find one because that is definitely a point that i'm wondering about i know others are too it's like sometimes you slightly change something so it's so it's related to a quote but it's not exactly yeah so a lot of the times i will say something like i think this means i actually read quote here here we go so like these are things i'm kind of directly annotating i'm doing it with the idea icon or this is a note to myself right this little pushpin icon so i will i will code them that way and mark something like this looks pretty appealing i have other examples of this but i forget which notes they're on um local consumption of peacock pheasant meat was a traditional activity have traditional foods become less popular in this region like that's a question that i have so instead of it being a note i would go back and make that a question and then when i come to this note in six months i will see i had one question and a research follow-up and this is the quote and this is my idea like i will i will mark them with icons so that i don't have to read all of the text i know that the link is here if i'm just looking for the link i don't have to go through this whole paragraph i just jump right to the link because i've left myself that visual cue can you jump to that link maybe oh oh sorry that's an external one okay i'm good okay oh golly that uh yeah that's an external link that's pretty cool usually yes usually also a tag icon sorry yeah it's a wow so you're really going in that direction that's pretty cool i mean i think it makes my brain light up in a nice way um but you you brought out the more functional aspect that you can parse information more quickly this way yeah yeah like yes they're pretty they're very pretty um the the cool thing that i do not try i've ever showed you is that all outstanding questions so this is my dated view snippet thing that lets me oh awesome i temporarily disabled them good job me i must have been testing something dataview js queries are disabled why is this my life you know because i wasn't planning to showcase this yeah we're on the cutting edge folks you know sometimes you really are why isn't this working seriously okay it's because i had needed to reload the whole pain so i have a query that brings every time i've ever queried left a question for myself isn't that nice okay wait whoa yeah so that absolutely i think anthony baker's question is perfect for this then because it's feeding into this idea so you're i mean this is a different form of a tag in a way um yeah how would you answer this so i use tags for very specific things i use tags as my to-do's so i do have research as a tag there are things that i specifically need to go down research like rabbit holes but sometimes i want to query let's say every every idea i've ever had this is every idea i've ever had is is the list bigger than 20 i'm joking [Laughter] so i can also query all of my well annotations it's very interesting i i'm trying to yeah i'm trying to think out like for myself when i would choose to use this approach versus um versus a tag so i use this where you use tags and like i suspect we have basically opposite systems um because all of my tags are this is something i need to do i need to go edit this i need to expand this i need to plan out that novel i need to turn this story stem into a story oh golly that's not the button i wanted to push i need to turn this into a newsletter i need to write this article i need to write this article of this type right like my my tags are very specific to my workflow i basically use them as a kanban board and this is like i need to finish reading these and then i have like 211 notes i haven't processed because i've been very busy um and like my ultimate goal is to have zero tags like every one of these tags is something i haven't done whereas your tags are almost more like categorical i think in nature they perform all sorts of things including like the example i was showing which is more categorical or classifying something and i don't think there's a wrong way to use tags some people use tags instead of folders i think that's fine um but because i used tags this way i needed a different way to query all of my outstanding questions and i needed a different way to query all of my ideas that i could follow up on that aren't quite i should turn this into a newsletter like it's just a different oh golly that's that's a that's a unwise query i meant to do that query so so i guess why this why this seems like it could work or i could find some uses for myself is one of the things i try to always leverage when i can is autocomplete because i won't remember um that much like i won't remember all the tags but if i know i can just hit on and immediately have a list that's popped up on the screen or if i start typing it's going to show me accretion so why this kind of works though is because you have a strict vocabulary of checkbox um i don't know what they're called what are they called they're so um i'm using data view sorry i'm not using i am using i'm using minimal sanctum has them soda's primary but on the minimal documentation they're called check box blocks um they're they're in the css is like data task i think they're they're just they're just checks they're checkbox icons really um and i just find them so helpful i really do uh i guess this wasn't at all what i had planned to talk about but you always you always you know throw me onto a different thing man so you have about 15 is that how many that you might use maybe more like 10 or 12 um priority ones yeah um yeah these are the ones that i like care about there are other ones that exist but i i mostly don't need the in progress and rescheduled stuff i don't ever like i just didn't need the up and down and win stuff like not that they're not cool other people would use them but the ones at the top were the ones that i care about yeah uh so i usually use important for i need to do this and stars are like you know start key information but i usually use the notes for the annotations the bookmarks are for an in external link and location is where i'm telling myself about an internal link so like this idea came from this location and then if i'm sitting down thinking to myself what are the good things and what are the bad things about going back to teaching or continuing with the obsidian community and creator economy things i um i will mark them up and down with these little icons and instead of having an essay to read i have three thumbs up and two thumbs down well golly i should i shouldn't go back to teaching this is like i'm happy doing this right it gives me that at a glance visual so helpful i love it the only thing i'd like to see added i know it's like this we're on the cutting edge so i'm sure it'll get there but i just want to put it out there openly is that this needs to be auto completed somehow so you can just hit whatever it is so you can have your list of 15. that exists automatic there's a plug-in for that i don't have it installed because i don't uh like i don't use it but it's one of ambulance plug-ins um and i it's not snippeter uh i see luke in the comments luke will probably know um there is a plugin to get to the hotkey for all of these and there there are like there are a variety of ways also he's saying um espanzo can autocomplete like if you just wanted to yeah i don't think expanso is is okay i guess it doesn't give you a drop down but there there are ways to get drop down um need the drop i uh you want it's called various compliments i think various compliments will auto complete your um if you have a note somewhere and you type in like four words of the note it will auto-complete the note for you hmm okay the notes okay okay yeah something to explore because i mean that's that's the like super power unspoken superpower of the software with um linking notes and with tags is that autocomplete allows you to just kind of get in the ballpark with a fuzzy search and it'll finish the rest for you and i would love to start using these in some some ways because i think you have a lot of awesome use cases yeah and to be clear again alexander this is not a plugin this is just css so this is this is a theme it's just it's a like it's an aesthetic thing it's not you don't need a plug-in it's it if you use minimal its sanctum like all of those it you don't need any kind of special functionality they work like it'll work on obsidian publish too that's the reason i use it instead of having used the um the other methods for like pretty boxes until like last week you couldn't get admonitions on obsidian publish but you could get css so i used these to give myself those big bright like boxes yes yes luke it's tax it's task collector thank you it is task collector oh okay task ask collector will let you um i don't actually know how it works but i know that it will like sort of let you change a bunch of things to a different um one of these checkbox icons sorry i wasn't i wasn't actually planning to talk about these i didn't realize that it would be part of our discussion or i would have come more prepared well that's that's that's that's the live component we never know what's going to happen yeah but okay so audio seems to be working not true let's do let's let's do a quick check-in with each other and with anyone who's um listening just we're at the hour mark what do we what do we want to do i mean you had something else to show um i think did yeah now that now that the mic's working until you actually want to show your actual thing then it's going to not work but um just in the chat um maybe we just keep going yeah yeah um so i guess this is what i meant with the locations go to like internal links that's what i use this icon for and these are external links but this is not the title of the link this is my own words so my claim is pigs are useful for medical research and then this is my claim pigs are useful model for studying diabetes because of their similarities to human that's evidence for my claim and then evidence of this claim is the link which you can see is a link but like it's a semantic scholar article that has nothing to do like not nothing to do but the title is not this so that is how i kind of tell myself these things and then uh type tree down or i guess drop why isn't that working why does the universe hate me i must have broken something in the last hour this is supposed to give a very their video okay i don't know how the index got broken but the index is fixed now so you can see um i was going to show you the pigs are useful for medical research my back links don't have anything about animals right the local graph see i used it in i took notes about what i wanted to talk about um but i don't like that's not really relevant to this claim statement right like this notes for live stream about nick is not like an academic concept thing yeah exactly i like my notes that are these slip box zettles to be very focused on sort of academic notes right like not my articles not my newsletters not my books just real things so these breadcrumbs that i leave myself are specifically only very cleanly for academic type notes and yes i can replicate that with filters but i like not having to and i also like that it will give me the second order things and yeah i can do that with changing the depth but that gets muddy fast and yeah i can filter it but i know that the view that i want is always just the related things up down and sibling so breadcrumbs has been really nice at giving me this specific kind of view that pigs are useful for medical research i have a note about pigs and that broader topic is animals it's just easier for me personally to navigate versus the local graph so the second header up of pigs is um could you go into source mode oh source view raw probably because it's um it's a breadcrumbs type tree direction up okay and then the and i think skeptic mystic is also interested in these graph he's uh that ross is the creator of breadcrumbs and also of a graph view because my next question then is how can we then see i don't think we're there yet but how can breadcrumbs and that information be shown on a graph oh do you know where we're at with that yeah just was that what you wanted yeah whoa because now we're getting kind of a little bit closer to the brain yeah those familiar with no no i don't mean like our brain but the software called the brain yeah you can do all kinds of uh views a juggle and breadcrumbs um are like integrated now okay i don't know how to i don't know you can do it almost anything with with breadcrumbs that you can do with juggle because you can create breadcrumbs blocks that use like juggle style graphs and eventually it's not here yet but at some point you're gonna be able to like hover on these things and then make pop-ups and put the pop-ups on top of the little icons and then you're going to have mind maps and it's going to be mind-blowing we're not there yet but we're closer than we should be in any like world in which i don't know the plug-in development that has been happening is amazing but i dream of a world where you can take excalidraw draw your own mind map and then pop open the hover views of these things like this and then like kind of put it there oh we're not we're not there yet but i see what you're saying yeah yeah we're closer than you'd think check back in a month we'll see how far we got and so and that it's saying broader and it's going up to animals and then what is it saying on the bottom it should seem it should say narrower but it's it's overlapping because it also has a weird like there's two of them here oh yeah okay it's trying to say narrower and broader at the same time i don't know why yeah i'm sure i did something i'm sure i did something wrong um quite interesting because i mostly use the um i mostly use the tree view the tree viewer just but it really helps me see where my notes fit together because i was starting to get overwhelmed with just you know 766 notes and even with maps of content which my pigs note is like not technically a map of content but it it forms like a similar kind of function it was it was getting to be like oh golly i have all these backlinks and then i have all these times when i talk about pigs and you know there's there's a bunch of like the breadcrumbs made it kind of a middle ground between every time i've ever mentioned it and having to manually update everything for my map of content whereas this lets me do it as i'm down talking about vivisection of the ancient world i can just remind myself hey this is part of the pigs are useful for medical research chain this is useful like this is about animals because we're talking about medical research with animal experiments so it lets me kind of just dump these concepts down and then move on cool and so i see your bookmark that's an external link to a paper or something yep and then uh cool and then if you had a question you could just do an indentation somewhere and throw in a task icon check box and somebody somebody asked earlier if you can query those with dataview you can't yet but it's on the beta branch you can of the data view plugin like like the developer is working on it but uh my note structure is a weird edge case for how he thought people used task icons because he didn't know about the icons he hadn't like you know it's a cutting edge thing um so he had set it up so that any bullet points were part of the metadata of the task and no longer part of the metadata for the note which caused some problems so he's still working on that but you know another month or two and we will have figured out a path forward that hopefully doesn't require me to refactor my entire vault i thought it was already i thought it was already working for i'm missing and what you're saying because i thought you know jes yes it works with with a javascript like query long form everything my method works but somebody was asking is it easy to just query like a normal data view query with show me every like bullet like show me every task of this nature and the answer is yes but you should not set your notes up the way that i set my notes up nice that makes sense i pioneered a thing that the developer had not anticipated which is a little bit my uh my brand that is cool but show me something cool about you nick i guess i could no i don't know i i really don't know um so maybe point me around or something how do you use yaml what do you do with yaml anything i i don't i have a couple notes out of a few thousand notes maybe two or more like 20 heavy ammo i know productivity wants to see scope so um yeah let's just do a little something here um i'll make these so data scopes um i'm for myself i'm saying are my various views viewports and um might be a little bit out of date but essentially if you go over here i do have not that many folders but i do have one called atlas now and i'm just kind of keeping track of my most important maps of content and my most important data scopes which are collections of data view queries so a data scope to me is a specific note that has a collection of queries that's what i think of as a data scope to think of different viewports yes data i want to see something else here data scope i use that um like for plugins for myself where i can look at different plugins and then have information on that plugin and but we can look at this information in different ways so we can look at it by interface plugins these are just what i'm calling them text work which is kind of its own area and i think it's so important if we want to work really fast is being able to work fast with text how quickly can you push move text around and do things so and then like by navigation i never told you i went through the the um the flight school it was awesome oh cool yeah i appreciate that like this reminds me because you have a section in flight school about plugins and yes this reminds me i never actually got around to telling you flight school is great thank you for collecting all of this information about all of these plugins well disclaimer not all the plugins because there are over 500 and i probably covered possibly just the ones that i try to use i even have by developer so like we're just using different ways to if i can zoom out just a little bit to uh yeah the show a little bit more here but if we can go by rating by developer a to z so these are just different queries looking at similar information but it's all within a single note super powerful and so i've been working and playing around experimenting having fun with different uh data scope notes let me see your heat map oh the heap okay that one is fresh that's uh and i can't remember the creator but i just saw this on the forums i was like well let me at least see what this is about all this data is not mine i just got it working but what it allows us to do is we can go to i'll go to like tomorrow's note so this is just not real data but um it has a money spent area and what that means is if we go back to this heat map which is a plug-in and let's go to the money spent tomorrow would be monday march 28th so that would be i guess monday i'm guessing that would be here sure might yeah numbers are hard yeah something like that anyways just playing around with this the heat map i'm actually against tracking a lot of stuff because i think it just becomes its own chore but um but i thought this was interesting enough that i just wanted to play and kind of look at it so um not my information but it is a way to to look at stuff yeah i i'm the worst at tracking things ah but it's it's cool yeah so that was this one but um let's see one that's more relevant people want to track projects i probably shouldn't be showing all this open you know there's a collapse all um somewhere yes yeah i got a hotkey but i don't use it enough to know what it is the reality is working in a vault yeah i'm not laughing at you i'm laughing with you there are definitely things i can do in my vault that i don't remember how to do what am i yeah i know i guess i'll end with this one but one of my favorite ones is being able to track prominent people by date of birth i guess the way my mind works is i want to know when they were born that's brilliant i want to know yeah i want to know when they're born because then i know what influenced them and i found something i'm hoping to do a video on this but certain types of thinkers that have resonated with me at various times in my life completely unrelated topics and areas and places i was living and they happen to be born within years of each other carl sagan and mihai chick sent me high they were born the same year different fields and uh and yet they were on my mount rushmore favorite thinkers so that's kind of interesting i don't know i i think there's something well i'm gonna i'm gonna swipe that for completely not real people but for my um my fantasy characters i'm gonna start like marking their their fake date of birth so that i can see like what is going on that's the whole reason that i've been that i've been um trying to leverage breadcrumbs is actually less for my academic notes and more for my stories because i've been having trouble getting a good view of like i will i write in a very non-linear way so i'll write a story and then another story and then another story and like this one's before that one and definitely after that one but then i will later write one that is before this other one and it's like what order did these happen and i i don't want to assign firm dates until i have to um so i tend to do things as before and after and i'm actually trying to get breadcrumbs to tell me the longest possible path between notes instead of the shortest possible path so i can do it almost like a table of contents of here is the like order that these things should be in the functionality isn't there yet but ross said he'd build it in as soon as he has time which i'm like will absolutely blow my mind so that i stop having duplicate entries and can just start seeing the the broadest to the narrowest of concepts and the earliest to the latest possible longest chain of this is the order that the story should go in um so like i'm i don't know of another app that will let me write in such a non-linear way and then put it into order for me based on information that i say like i know that because this story involves uh this kind of magic spell that was only invented you know after this other thing then it needs to be after that other thing and and just put them into order for me so that i don't have to think about it i'm but something like this also where you know i will say this character was born before that character and after that character and then it will let me hopefully create dates and then i can query a nice index of here are the dates here are the characters here's the story they're involved with like like this query that you've got up now with these people you could also add to that any notes that you have involving them like you could you don't have to obviously they're your notes but like i'm going to steal that shamelessly and then have a third column for notes that link to those notes interesting you know i want to see where you go with that because i think that there's a lot of power there and so you're on the edge of it because breadcrumbs is a little intimidating but um let's see well for this you wouldn't even need breadcrumbs you just want like i if these were my notes which they're not you're using them for a different purpose but i can already see um i want to add i want to see in this query that you've got a third column that is all of the backlinks for carl sagan okay interesting and it probably can be done right now right we could go in here and uh it should be um table dates comma file dot in links in links like that one word yeah let's see if it works yes that was pretty cool i feel like magic yeah so i mean i'm usually very terrible at dataview but isn't that like just now you can even see what you like why those people are relevant to you yeah um and you i mean and i'm getting something to give information here yeah you can also do outlinks too if you want you don't have to they're your notes but like i might get a little but i mean for the sake of seeing what's going on then that seems like this i think i don't know how um but you can even combine them but like is it that cool yeah it is ed you can um you can uh if you want to make it bigger there are ways oops make what bigger the screen so like the the screen yeah maybe oh you mean it's uh um uh you want readable line with i have a hotkey for it you probably don't uh like if you want the table to be wider yeah but you have readable line width turned on because you're saying uh for uh toggle readable line width in your editor settings uh readable like here yeah that's the one oh you do have hockey's plus perfect that that's what i wanted jeez so then if you add if you if you add the out links then you can have the other column and it won't feel so cramped yeah i really like this that was a hesitation i had with some of the you know going too far into dataview um in plain text but being able to expand it this way is excellent i'm just loving this now and like what's the harm of having this you right like let's say your notes explode you can still get this information this is just an information view it's not corrupting your notes or anything yeah but now you can see look i didn't know that all of those people had to do with jazz so and that's another so i was going to click in to show you but now you've i don't even have to click in to show you because of what you just showed me but um i will show it just because it's somewhat related so if we click on this person and then they're going to have a link over here but what i wanted so i did the same people list except here's here's the tag that i'm using you could i'm sure you'd figure out a different different way i would probably do it differently but yeah i would get the same information right yeah but so now with sortable in life preview sortables this blew my mind so not don't look at duke elliott at ellington but look at these other people 1920 to 1926. i randomly chose these people just based on songs i was listening to and was enjoying and it turns out they were all born yeah they're all born very specific generation of jazz that you like nick that's what i've learned i don't know i don't think that's necessarily it i think it uh i think well that's part of it so you're not wrong but i just think that speaks to what was going on to make this all come alive and so spurs on this whole line of research that i think can be quite fruitful so i just think that's uh pretty wild oh go back go to uh go back to the page you were just on this one yeah um have you played around with call outs yet oh no no i haven't what is it it's something like bracket exclamation point info no no go back inside info bracket and then type wiki sure that's fine too and then you can put your quote up there if you want you don't have to but it's cool oh i oh let me try this because i that would be a way to use it so you're saying that and then so i use these for um just like how you have here when i'm quoting something that is multiple lines um i i just find this visually easier and i think you can even do cool stuff like fold them yeah what's the folding syntax do you know of hand no but i can google it okay yeah that so that's just okay i don't mind this and my whole thing is like thinking well not whole thing but i'm also kind of considering the future-proof angle of this versus the header approach yeah i mean it depends on what you're going for um i am often trying to make the citation um more visible for me so like seeing that it is from wikipedia is easier for me like i would put that wikipedia link up at the top because i prioritize well i just definitely should not have pushed that button um that's the button i want i prioritize information at a glance and the the callout syntax is the same syntax that like github uses and for me future proofing is can i read this in plain text and the answer is yes so like it's still a block quote right like if the way that the way that it will fail so go back to the code okay the way that this fails is that it fails into plain text and looks basically like this which is not substantially different than what you had like you lose the icon but you don't lose the readability in plain text it's so it's plain text version of these two yeah like you've all you've added is a line of all you've added is a line at the top that is a link that will still work yeah that's true um this is yeah this is kind of nice uh to have that the fold things to experiment with and play with yeah wow we just keep going is there anything else we should we're getting we're getting close i think we actually kind of hit our stride once we uh not hit um but once we stopped having tech problems yeah the data view thing was kind of helpful for me to yeah i didn't even think about thank you hotkeys plus plus and argentina what's not aware of that uh readable it's readable line with this one okay yeah i have it i have it hotkeyed to ctrl shift l okay i'm definitely going to work on that you can also you can also set it up so that um you have you have css uh like a you have a css class that will put all of you don't you don't have to toggle it if you just know that that note should be wide because it's a dataview query you can just have that note open by default in wide but you need a css for that talk to uh talk to the developer of like of the the uh light theme you can add that in oh within within the theme itself yeah you can also do it as a snippet but the idea is that you can assign certain notes to always be wide okay okay somebody's asking you about your forge and your foundry yeah so that those are a couple other data scopes that are related to things that i'm creating i can't really share those right now but i will say that the forge is stuff that is being created uh like you know blacksmith hammering whereas the foundry is like a mold has been already created and it can be reused so like if i've created something and it's it's already been used but i can kind of reuse it somewhere else it could go into the foundry because then i can take that mold and kind of reshape it for something else that's kind of how i'm thinking about it i bet you use tags for that yes i totally use folders for that all right if we go it means um yeah before it holds works that need work the foundry holds works that can be reworked so simple let me see your tag view oh this old thing yeah wow i would actually die so we need we need to do a couple things here to make it i want to work with um cecilia with the indents it's a little there's something that i haven't brought up yet but i think we can make it better but yeah these i mean on is where everything goes so this is where if there's a description on any note it can go here but what i'm really happy about is note and these i mean the seed box if i haven't seedbox is a term is coined by price baldwin in the land of pkm we'll say but this has been quite nice because now i need to turn off readable you gotta add that hotkey well it will be added yeah what's nice about this one is this is another data scope note and then i don't want to think about notes as being evergreen or not or that doesn't do me any good in fact it creates this friction is it evergreen yet and that doesn't oh i don't care i am so with you and also anthony had a question about this about whether we do note types in our like yama and stuff and i don't because it's a note like i can tell what type of note it is from the title of the note i don't need to like tell myself to type in a tag or anything and how about you yeah i don't i don't do that other i don't do that as well the thing that i do like to do is say if there's an action i want to take on a note and i don't want to forget about it so then i can just give it a very simple like tag so that you can see all these boat notes these are notes that like there's this this i've heard about this guy but this is all i have it's just reminding me to go back when the time's right and look into connecting this lonely boat floating in the ocean all alone to some other notes so there's there's a connection so that's i mean like even mihai is under the boat note because there's so much more i can say and i don't have any that many links but if we go into like develop then these are probably have a few links but i'm telling myself there's more i can do here and uh but they're just fun like that's the thing it's not a to-do list a seed box is kind of a it's an opportunity box really it is yeah when i'm bored at nine o'clock at night and too tired drawing an entire article i go poking through my notes to look for things that i could like you know be inspired by and then i maybe add stuff and then i maybe accidentally write three articles exactly exactly but it's not like what i set out to do because i had to do something it's just ah man i'm tired here's a list of things i meant to do something with i don't know i don't want to work on a project i just want to like fiddle people have a lot of like things to say about fiddling with and messing with and like you know oh you're just tweaking your notes like yes but you know what i really like doing when i'm too tired to be properly productive tweaking my notes because then when i'm just tweaking them it's actually productive by accident but i didn't have enough like left at nine o'clock at night after putting my kid to bed to start a project but i can i can tweak and then accidentally get pretty far with my productivity which is nice yeah i i agree i agree um i'm just there's one other thing that's that seems related to surface area of i'm not sure how far i took this but i'm interested in what you're saying and what kind of this con where this conversation is going because we can use a tool like obsidian to expand our surface area of happy little accidents of making insights and it just happens like when you're not trying to rigidly force yourself into you must do this and then this and then this instead you just create these there's a term for it which joel anderson knows uh told me about in the academic world affordances and it's what the environment offers the individual so this environment and how you structured i wrote that whole article about how obsidian helped me quit video games not that i was trying to quit video games it happened by accident um the last time i sat down and wrote three articles for fun was because i was trying to play a video game and the map was taking too long to load so just to fiddle because i was waiting i went into my notes because it's fun for me and like obsidian has really given me somewhere fun to play around with intellectual things and it's wonderful and it doesn't like i know that you and i talk about it and you know joel talks about it people talk about it but in the broader meta there's just not enough focus given to the idea that if you're having fun in the place where your notes and ideas live then you will do things with your notes and ideas sometimes by accident and you have to allow for that for it to be fun and interesting because learning should be fun and interesting it shouldn't be a jira task list with a ticketing system yeah i i totally i mean we were like in sync on this one big time which is so much so i had to pull with this one which is that i always turn to it because uh this there's this that toxic productivity world uh where society's telling us all these things and it's just because it's kind of hidden where the value will emerge from it's it's not a magic trick it just happens and it's just a little bit harder to see you always because you have to just you know work with ideas but if it becomes a fun place you're going to be there more often and then like there's the yeah i mean the magic does happen if i'm having more fun roll scrolling through old notes in obsidian when i'm killing 10 minutes instead of scrolling on twitter i'm that much more likely to have a positive interaction that gives me something interesting to say the next time i'm at a party not that i've been to a party in like years but you know next time i talk to friends exactly likewise so let's wrap this this one up i feel like yeah i screamed a lot i'm not if you want to say okay i know i'm out of things to say this has been great you usually don't share your screen with me so it's been fun yeah i know i was i was thinking that just now i was like oh i'm sharing more than normal yeah it's been a great experience we should like i don't know we should do another live stream in like three to six months yeah consider consider that on the schedule then um hopefully my tech will work in the chat i'm curious if if what were some takeaways for everyone or what's something you're taking away from this just to uh really cement for for i'd like to know um but also to cement this for you too to make it one way to externalize something get some more neurons firing so we don't just lose everything that we may have gotten from this kind of curious if anything's going to come into the chat what's a takeaway what's something you learned people are typing away furiously i'm sure right now either that there's like two seconds of lag oh yeah that's right yeah that's right there is i think we're like uh like 30 seconds ahead in case something goes wrong i don't know how it works but i assume it's like radio productivity says wow the emotes well it's on screen the emotes of eleanor perhaps breadcrumbs oh the bullet journaling thing yeah i so i used to do um a paper i still do a paper bullet journal and that's where i got a lot of the um a lot of my interest in these these check boxes because my my bullet journal is very you know color-coded and has a lot of icons basically and i learned a lot from bullet journaling long before i found obsidian and adapting that mentality into obsidian has been incredibly helpful yeah that's really cool to see because that's what you're doing and it's yeah i mean this is a really good time a good good time since we just finished the workshop i have some headspace to try on some new things so i'm excited to uh to do just that okay um yeah how to use exactly that one anthony um trying to sort how where to find call outs oops a couple more and then i think we'll wrap it up let's see if i'm missing any craigs oh you can use the same tools to achieve very different things yeah and you can use different workflows to achieve the same things too like nick and i have a very similar philosophy and and go about it in in like the opposite ways which is fun yeah it is it's really true oh we have a few more coming in see how it's easy excellent oh forest okay the mind maps are cool too yeah i saw fp in there and um and so forth said something about resonance tagging that's a term i'm not familiar with but i definitely want to learn more because that resonates with me yeah that's that's what it's all about relevance and resonance um in my world yeah yeah very very true elias take one thing at a time and don't go crazy i i still haven't gotten leaflet working and it's been on my radar for like a year like focus on the ones that you need set up systems that support play in fiddling all right we're in the final final few here relevance tagging okay so i'll be looking into that one i just just understand what the people have said around it yeah circle back i'll do some digging okay let's wrap this one up so yeah eleanor a lot of fun this is great we should not have waited this long but we oh man the holidays i'm still digging out from the holidays and it's like almost april yes yes it is okay well i guess we'll do another one sometime this summer yeah we'll do another one on the books and see where bread crumbs is at exactly okay well really enjoyed this and as always thanks for your time thank you for hosting me
