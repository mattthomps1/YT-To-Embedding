[Music] okay hey this meeting is being recorded and uh pretty excited to have everybody this is the first lighthouse session where we're going to talk to very interesting people that are fascinating and how they think and what they have to share and to kick off this whole series we have eleanor koenig uh eleanor how are you doing i am very happy that this many people are showing up to watch me learn about stuff and poke at plugins yeah this is exciting i was saying before the recording we were kept out at 100 people i thought we were able to go to 500 the zoom setting didn't work out my apologies if you're just watching the recording we're going to try to upgrade behind the scenes but i'm not sure if that's going to be solve the problem while we're live but we'll see and eleanor so where should we get going we're talking pkm there's so many areas we always have fun talking so i i feel like my like my role in our relationship is that i find weird new things that pop out of the obsidian discord and i share them with people like that's that's the whole point of the round up right is that i keep up with all of the new fangled cutting-edge stuff and the thing that i have been loving these last couple of i don't know weeks since we last talked is i have the quick add plugin which is like it started out as a templater script and like you know javascript is hard right like javascript is hard for people who like me don't know a ton about programming but christian very helpfully uh made this plugin that is a little bit more of a graphical gui user-friendly kind of templating thing that lets you use macros and he solved the problem that i have been having since basically day one of obsidian where i want to have all of my um i want to have all of my like literature source notes in one file all of those annotations that were pulled in from zotero and with empty notes and everything and i wanted to have all of them in one file but i also wanted to have atomic settles and what a lot of people have historically done is they use note refractor to take their source note and split it off into individual notes but then you lose the beauty of the source note where you can just go through everything chronologically and i know that there's the whole subtle costume thing where you know you shouldn't have it like that and really you just want the atomic little note cards and i i get that but i don't like that so quick add is the opposite well quick add is a lot of things but the that'll the zebelizer like macro that christian helped me make that's a lie that christian made for me it and i'll show it to you in a second it instead of pulling everything out and spitting it over into individual notes it makes individual notes that embed the sections and i know that that's like hard to picture which is why i asked nick to let me come in and do this because it's so much easier to see it when you like can poke it so let me figure out screen sharing uh i think it's this button and i think it's this button and theoretically you can see my vault now yes we can awesome okay so here are basically two source notes from i should switch these these are two source notes from the zotero empty notes thing that i showed like last time we talked and if you look on the left this is a raw dump of a file that i read like yesterday this is i i changed one thing and i was like wait no i should pause so i can show people what it looks like before i touch it uh so it's just quotes and page numbers there's like not a ton here this is what it looks like when it gets into my vault if i'm reading something quickly and know that i don't need to write an annotation every time because i'm writing my newsletter or i'm working on an article and i don't have time to go through the whole flow i'm just like finding the quotes i need and making sure that i save them and then when i'm done with that i kick them over into my vault into my zotdumps folder which is just a bunch of stuff that i haven't fully processed yet and then i go through and i've shown this before where i'll like look at the quote and see what the point of it is and it looks like they used horses this beast of burden sheeps were used for meat and secondarily wool fiber there's a bunch here so i will probably split this off into a couple of different things but rather than waste our time doing that i'm going to switch over to this file where i've already done that so you can see here i have the page number that it came from and my like short titles at all which somebody in the discord actually called the koenig method and i like almost died so this is a thing that apparently i pioneered in the community so i'm a little proud of it but um the idea is that i have this short title where i summarize the important stuff and then i can talk more about why it's important and why i care about it like this thing that happened in the 50s bc is weirdly similar to the modern american politics filibuster stuff happening right now uh so i i found that interesting and wrote it down and i have a whole bunch of stuff like that and then i can and i hope i do this right because i don't do this very often but i can run the zetalyzer through the command palette with control p i can run quick add there's probably a fast there is actually a faster way to do this but i'm like not very good at hotkeys so i like to do it the make sure i'm doing it correctly every step way so i type in quick add into the command palette and then i run quick add and then this javascript is um i i told quick ad where to find this javascript thing that christian gave me and then when i click it a whole bunch of new zettles appear theoretically in do you see it if this wasn't here before this file we just got created and the romans wound up banning sky watching is down here so it turned all of these it didn't get rid of them it didn't move them it turned them into embedded devils wow isn't that cool that's pretty cool so now like yeah i don't have a ton of independent thought here yet but every time i come back and find something that's on this topic instead of dumping it in here or making a whole new zeddle i can like add it to this file that's my like overarching note about romans banning sky watching and all of the like politics around that that interesting so and and that keep that open please if you can um the romans wound up banning skywatching so and the note on the left that's the source and uh you did the magic quick add we it exploded all of the header threes into new notes but it also links back to that uh source note right yeah so um here you'll probably enjoy this graph how do i uh i like want to open it up here ah sorry hang on i'm actually really terrible at hotkeys and stuff so if i can find my they were color coded why aren't they color-coded still oh cause i changed the number i made my vault flatter my my zip my slip box i made it flatter you're slowly bringing me over into one slip box folder ever so slowly i changed the number when i deleted a couple of folders so my zettles are red and my newsletter stuff we don't need this right now my zettles are red and then my source notes are in what folder is that that's 43 43 folder 43. note how easy the johnny decimal thing makes that by the way so you can see how these source notes go with the zeddles that got created and then i reference them in other p and other places so this is one of my mocs that's not relevant and it's just like you can kind of see 42 is the subtlest so this is pretty cool so just talking it out the path so you're searching well you're filtering when you do path colon and 42 is because your folder is called 42 zettle or whatever and it's seen that and now you can color those so this is really cool between you know your your source note material and the zettles to see because the source note will act sort of like um a hub or a map of content and then the zettle should kind of hover around each hub in theory or at least many of them okay let me see if i can break there we go i want to forget the local graph it'll be easier to see on the local graph all right so then if i filter this to depth two you should be able to get a sense of kind of how there's like all of these little hubs it makes it so much easier to look at the file and see how much stuff i got out of it does that make sense yeah it does and then this other cool thing that quick add does is it makes an outline for it i always move it to the top but i didn't want to bother christian anymore and ask him to move it to here so i can do that by myself and then pretty interesting here hang on i made fake admonition in css because i don't like using code blocks so it looks pretty now this is some nerd talk everyone so um okay so now you should be able to actually see stuff so um i i don't know i i added some css to make the outline a little bit prettier but now whenever i look at the file i don't have to scroll down or use the outline thing to look at what my like top level thoughts were i can just look at the top of the file and be like ah yes this one i learned about abusing um prophecies and how prophecies were politicized in the roman empire and use that when i'm writing my newsletter i'm a little i'm actually feeling a little slow right now so can you zoom take us back one moment so on the bottom is more of the source note and on the top is one of the related settles within the source okay yes and i can open more of them to for context okay and these are all coming from that source note below okay so if you look at the title the romans wound up banning skywatching they've been skywatching so these are all the little atomic notes but i didn't break my source note and then as i go i can come i can have a map of content where i'm like all right i learned you know i have this this let's say i have this overarching thing about politicians changing rules based on misuse really if i have that i don't have that yet i'm gonna have to go back to this video and take notes on the things i'm about to say but let's say hypothetically that i want to have a note about or an article or a newsletter or something an analysis piece about politicians changing the rules based on misuse of something and then i'll go and instead of linking to this heading i'll link to these zeddles because if i change the title they're not fragile anymore and they won't break because obsidian auto updates if you change which title if i change the title of the file oh yeah because if i change the title of the heading it'll break that's right so it solves all of those like how to make your source notes atomic without losing your source note problems that i was having for like i mean i i debated back and forth with dave ken about this like we was like i understand why you're doing atomic notes but i really i really don't want to like i don't want to lose all and then christian made it so easy just just so easy so now you have the value the value of atomic notes but you get to keep the koenig method right yeah with using the headers too okay so my next question would be if i hope i'm not interrupting your flow is on one of those zettles one of the top two there how do you then add your commentary or do you to that note because those are embedded i think it was luke in the comments who said that you're transcluding or embedding this and that's what you can see in edit mode so do you just add comments below or what's your flow after so this is okay so this would make a good um so i i just had you just heard me have all those thoughts this would make a good article idea or something compiling a bunch of different examples of how what did i say of how politicians change rules based on things that actually happen and abuse and then i'm like oh that reminds me hard cases make bad law that's something i learned in law school it should be a subtle of its own remember the okay so um i don't know how many of you guys are american or know weird stuff about american law but there was a case um american case law about um like how much you have to maintain your house property property maintenance where a little kid got hurt and it was because the property wasn't maintained but they were trespassing like a little kid got hurt so the judge felt bad and was like even though you were trespassing we're gonna make the property owner pay for all of your medical bills because they didn't maintain their fence on the land where they had a whole bunch of keep out signs hard cases make bad law that should be hard cases okay yeah like difficult emotionally difficult cases make bad law it's one of the things that makes the supreme court like so weird um in america is that the justices are trying very hard to not actually pay any attention to the ramifications of their decisions like they're supposed to like like leaving aside all of the modern politics blah blah blah the sort of platonic ideal of the supreme court is that they're supposed to just apply the law and not feel bad for people which is kind of the opposite of how like common law is supposed to work leaving all of that aside the idea is that difficult bad things going wrong makes for like weird implications like you're required to maintain your property and pay the bills of somebody who robs you because of that case there was another case where somebody was trying to break into someone's house and fell through the roof or fell through the floor or fell through the stairs i don't remember but they got hurt robbing someone and the homeowner was required to pay for their medical bills that's crazy right so hard cases make bad law is something that i vaguely remember from law school 10 years ago but it should probably be a zettle which goes into my root i've been using my root as an inbox i know this doesn't work for a lot of people but i'm the kind of person who if you put something on my desk i i will put it away right like i will organize it don't put it in a folder that says inbox i will never look at that folder don't put it neatly on my i'm you can't see it but i'm looking at my like little file sorter thing that i use with my students that's home because i haven't been working like except for at work where i have a very different system and even then kids should put it on my desk or i'm never going to find it unless they know where it lives for sure and they never do put it on my desk and i'll put it away because i'm like a very like organized neat folder kind of person so if it's in my root it will like it me until i put it away you know i kind of work in that same way actually where um on my route that's where any new note will go and it's not like i have to file it because i'm just going to put it in the same exact folder like 99 times out of 100. um which i call umami which is like the full mouth feel like that hidden sense because it's vague enough that anything can go there like where most people call zettles or that but i just like to see it one more time before i put it there that's the only reason i do the inbox method just because i can see quickly all that stuff from the past week or the past month because sometimes i'm quite lazy and and i'll wait that whole time and then i'll just kind of scroll through back oh what were all these notes i made and then i'll just plop them in you know one folder but at least i get one more touch just one more touch to kind of solidify some of those notes before they get lost or before i you know maybe i wanted to do something but i don't need to process them for my use cases but yeah anyways keep going sorry i got distracted and i was um i was totally listening to you because you're right that's a good system but i was like oh no i actually want to organize this this way because it was in my root and bothering me so what i'm gonna say here is misuse of law makes people change laws that's a claim i made a claim good job me so i'll use that somewhere probably and then i'm gonna sort it because even though i'm live on camera it's bothering me gives us a peek into your johnny decimal filing system so now it's neatly put away i bet you will have some questions on on your folder filing system but we'll save those for a little later yeah and then the other nice thing that quick ad does is let's say that i have put together this very neat window of like i'm doing stuff here right like this is my notes on the topic and let's say hypothetically hypothetically my husband pops into my office and says hey eleanor uh don't forget to update the dns servers for your thing so that everything doesn't break when you're doing your presentation and i'm like oh yeah i should i should make a note about that but i don't want to open any other files because my workspace is the way i like it i can hit control q and take a note about let's say unrelatedly hmm that's something smart that i said recently oh i wanna options yeah add to okay add to note okay so don't forget for hard cases make bad law to include the part about the thief hurting themselves and having see christian i do use this all the time hurting himself and having to have the homeowner pay the bills notice i made a typo i don't care i also feel like people not in america are probably like why would anybody have to pay that bill but whatever america is weird so so what just happened again you used i just used this little quick pop-up modal to take a note this is part might have made this for me but i think it's quick i quick ad can definitely do this i i made it roughly around the time that quick ad was like sort of first becoming a thing so you type and you type something where where did it go where did it go it went to my root not this gotcha it went here to my root new note as like a thing and like this is a to-do list and eventually i can extract that into my daily note which is 20 21 07. we'll make a new one i'm not going gonna actually do this but like i could put it into the bottom of a note using no refractor but i have private personal stuff in my notes so i'm not gonna do that right now but the idea is that i can i can take care of it when i'm ready to take care of it without messing up my like system because sometimes i'll have a text editor in one window and all of my notes for an article i'm writing on the other window and then i'll have a thought that has nothing to do with anything that's on my screen and i don't want to add more windows because there's like some kind of hotkey foo that you can do where you can like open a new window exactly where you want it and i'm very bad at that hot gotcha all right so exploring pkm uh non-fiction studies fiction writing creative inspiration uh we're kind of touching lightly on all these at the same time i'm just trying to see if there's anything that we wanted to hit on especially so i mean i guess just to kind of give an overview of how i go from i moved on this before but i i go from this to storytelling i've talked about how i go from this to an article right but with stories what i'll often do is i'll have a note um here here's one i was working on like this week chestnuts chestnuts no that's not right so people have that yeah you guys can go poke this too um and we'll stop and move to questions in a minute but this is a story i wrote and it involved chestnuts also welcome to the sneak peek of the stuff that i'm literally shipping with my newsletter tomorrow so this is a record of a tweet storm that sarah tabor did about chestnuts and i don't know how much you guys know about the history of the american chestnut and how it was basically extinct yeah it's it's interesting though um so basically the american chestnut basically went extinct because of an imported fungus from east asia and it turns out that the chestnut was actually vitally important to the appalachian mountain region and like it the chestnuts are food the wood's really great the trees are important for a lot of different species and it basically economically devastated a fairly large chunk of the american east and this is a very small detail in the story that i wrote but like i included it very purposefully and [Music] hang on i really look forward to the day that we get better yaml handling so this is a newsletter that i wrote about mythological cats unrelated to the chestnut in so except in so far as all of this research went into me writing this story so i am keeping track using the breadcrumbs plugin which is cool i think ross made this it's cool i haven't fully started utilizing it but it's helpful but it helps me keep track of which notes go with which story because we were talking about like what inspires my stories so i have all of this research and when i sit down to tell a story it all becomes like fodder in my brain and then i put together the american chestnut and agriculture budgeting and the struggles of the appalachian region with you know mythological cats and then i come up with a story that i i think is good and um i i have this analysis piece and you know what's hilarious i actually don't even remember what it's called because i already like i didn't ship it but i scheduled it so let me find it it should be in here somewhere you know what i can just do this is the sort of thing that i write um for my newsletter which is launching today well this part of it's launching today the all of the like summary stuff i've been doing for like a year but i'm i'm launching this new can i share this yeah yeah please um so i'm launching this new feature where i write analysis of all of the research and cool nerdy stuff that went into the story because i had this epiphany hanging out with people in the discord that that there's this whole like there's this picture that gets shared around on writer twitter where like here's the iceberg and readers only care about the tip of the iceberg for your world building but you need to do the research for all of the underlying stuff but you should only include the top stuff i was like wait no actually the research is pretty interesting like people seem to be willing to sign up for the little summaries of what i'm researching like maybe people will also be interested in the behind the scenes of why i wrote the story so i guess this is the grand experiment to see if you guys are interested in the like behind the scenes of why i wrote the story and the cool nerdy facts about chestnut trees and you know weird folklore any of us will be interested in chestnuts guarantee you but no but more to your point there is something fascinating about our interest like art used to just be this finalized product um and you just look at it like a painting but now it's like the story behind the story the behind the scenes how it was done all these things give us this uh i'm going to use it again that word umami um to kind of give us this fuller experience and um i think you know it's a shared human experience behind the scenes counts too so that's kind of cool that you're doing this this is the child note for see i i was literally working on this last night so i didn't finish doing the breadcrumb stuff so this is how the breadcrumb thing works you give it you tell it whether something is a parent sibling or child and this is the child note for the cat and wolf story right i wrote it after i finished the story so theoretically um maybe i messed something up i haven't used this much don't yeah don't judge me but i'm very excited about it field name it says child oh maybe because it's capital yama's real finicky i don't know i figured out later but the general idea is that now i'm able to better keep track of like what things go with what so there we go okay so it's for some reason an implied connection instead of uh probably because it's not actually physically in this yaml so it'll pick up the stuff it's like backlinks but more targeted does that make sense a little i was just expecting it to say parent and then boom but it's giving real or implied it's because this act this yaml actually says it and it's i think maybe ross is here i don't know but um it's picking up that it's not literally in the yaml it's not a specific relationship but because i assigned it in this other thing can you go back to the one you were just on i just want to see how it compares to the link mentions below and it looks like an unlinked message anyways something to dive deep into but i think there are definitely use cases for that adding very specific uh metadata to show connections um with more context to them there's definitely a lot going on there so kind of a full full gazettel approach the idea i'm i don't know that i'm like doing it right but i i like the idea of more structured kinds of connections not for the middle of my slip box like the middle of the block should be a delightful spaghetti mess but these very specific workflows that i have of here's my research here's the notes here's the story here's the analysis piece here's the newsletters like they're i mean i realize that they're all newsletters now but in my head that like monday morning very structured like the this thing this is more what i mean when i say like the newsletter like this it's a very they're all this format of a couple fun facts and like a bit of a deep dive but not not like a long-form analysis piece so like all of those connect in a very specific way and i wanted to have something a little bit stronger than the links in the backlinks and the graph to show me that very strong connection so thanks ross you're great cool so where does this take us let's see i think the q a i feel like people probably have questions we have a few questions um and then i just opened the door for more questions so we'll kind of see can um what is the koenig method um i feel weird saying it like that but somebody else did it first the coding method is basically this source note thing that i do and i i'm sure other people do it too but um i did it with nick when we figured out the like so zettlecaston has this idea that your source notes should just refer back to the text which makes a ton of sense if you still have the text in front of you but a lot of the time one my search does not index pdfs and i want to actually search the knowledge that i have pulled um and two a lot of the times i'm working from a from a paperback library book like i i still work with like dead tree books and i have to give this back so i can't just say oh this is the note go refer to the text like i don't have an academic library right next to me like lumen did like mine is i have to order it so what i do is this thing was a trexler where this does not come from the actual pdf like they come like this and then part of my process is instead of making the zeddle as the text of a file i kind of make it the header because it's easier for me to see the content there and on rare occasions i will add notes to self or some further context like this and this is how i take notes it's it's a more academic workflow than a proper proper is the wrong word that uh that'll cost personal knowledge management your own independent thought kind of thing because i like my those 500 word articles and my synthesized longer articles and my story like that it's not like i'm not synthesizing things into my own words i just don't want to lose these source notes yeah so i organize them that way and it kind of organize them in a vln a very long note right and then and then from there you can pull them out here's a related question how often are you using the zettalyzer for a source node is it just once because if you do it more than once will you end up with duplicate files duplicate files if you break out atomic notes more than once that's a great question i only do it once um my my flow is once i pull it in i have this dumps thing and then once i am done processing these i like i i'm done processing it and anything that i go back and add i can do manually like this analyzer is to save me time it's not the only way to do it it's just you're automating when you're doing a whole file because you don't need to automate if you're not doing a whole file that makes sense yeah yeah so you make your your 20 or so whatever it is one hundred headers heading three and then use it allies once yeah so some of these files are longer than others like i have i i was working on this one last night because city walls is the upcoming topic for the newsletter and i don't have time to do it when i'm trying to prepare for two newsletter articles and also my kid is sick and also i have this zoom planned so i just didn't have time to do it right i'll fix it later so much so much what theme are you using i think it was answered in the chat but um if you just want to say that oh uh so i used paleton8 um which is sort of i rolled my own i pulled snippets from a bunch of different places and then eventually put it all together because people kept asking um other great themes are yin and yang um which i use on noble and um i can't remember i don't know why i can't remember the name of the one that i like that slrvbb made oh my god oh yeah um spectrum and its theme are also like really nice but i i have so many little like things that really matter to me that i just made my own which is again kind of how i wound up in the land of not using managed hosting and rolling my own servers because sometimes i just want to poke it yeah i have a no programming background but i've dabbled in css and that's it's almost like a gateway drug i think if you start with css then you know like i want to design my theme and next thing you know you're you're getting involved in other things like yaml and that yeah that sort of thing i do want to say though your theme was used yesterday in one of the the light workshop showcases by anya very cool to see a fellow writer so that maybe there's something with the novelists the writers who are interested in in your theme i don't know it's got a lot of heavy stuff for that how do you get the quotes for pages as shown i'm not i'm assuming that's as we're seeing it right now for example so it's kind of yeah that's custom to your theme is that the vision like the quotation mark yeah yeah that's part of palestinian okay you can it's public you can somebody will probably share you a link to the github i'm i'm counting on you guys somebody give them a link to the github do you do all your writing in obsidian or when do you use word that's a great question um i use word for outlets that require me to submit things inward so i use the pandoc plugin for that which is super helpful um so like cifla wants things inward tor is perfectly happy to let me slap it into their wordpress which is nice but um a couple places want it as a standard manuscript format thing um so i use word for post processing i do all of my actual writing in markdown depending on my mood or muscle memory at the time i will use either right monkey 2 or typora when i split screen so if i have my vault with like 7 000 notes open and it's like all my notes long form writing and obsidian on my relatively small screen is difficult with all of that so i'll use um a different editor like on my left hand screen and then i'll have my notes on the right hand screen because then i don't know like the hotkey thing i like i like i like writing long form stuff in obsidian just fine as long as i'm not using a bunch of reference notes so if i'm actively querying my vault for stuff i will write in either right monkey or um typora okay okay let's see next question i have a lot coming up what is your text formatting caps versus non-capped methodology in what regard um i don't know are there some times where you're using all caps perhaps um maybe there are some file names that are like that if so it's probably from zotero if you give me the actual example i can tell you um we'll see if that we'll see if that comes in the chat probably just the default name of the pdf that i didn't fix i usually try to fix it i usually don't like all caps so we'll come back to the questions in a moment i do want to say you you have the obsidian publish i do right okay and we've been sharing it in in the chat every now and then but it's i mean you just put that out there so would you like to talk about that i mean it's my fault like i just uh i thought hang on let me bring it up um screenshots uh so the reason that i should sharing it's pretty cool a lot of people ask me questions in discord and it i'll be like oh here let me send you a screenshot but it's not the same like it's not it's not as easy to share information that way because you can't get all of the information on one screen and um thanks to the kind and generous donations of for people helping me with the server hosting of um obsidian roundup which i deeply appreciate because it's a lot of work i decided that it would make sense to just go ahead and get published which uh i know that you like i don't know you can do it for free but not easily and i after spending the last two too many days fighting with servers for your ghost i just wanted to pay somebody to do it for me so thanks lee cat and silver for making it a one-click button but basically i just wanted to to be able to more easily answer questions for people because you know people want to know stuff and they want you know answers and it's a lot easier to give an answer about something if i can give them a link and let them yeah figure it out yeah i think it's a it's kind of it's kind of um it's you're almost self-adulating yourself when you send a link to your public vault i mean i've done this but it's also a really good way to give someone an answer because you're like i've given this a lot of thought here's what i've written about it here's a link and boom it's there but you've gone a step further and you're not mentioning it but you should like this can be downloadable am i right oh yeah yeah so um i think it's on the welcome page but uh i feel i feel a little bad about this actually but if you want to download the actual like zip file of my vault uh you can but i'm i'm charging two dollars for it just to have a paywall because i don't want google to crawl it and because it has um so the version that i'm sharing on my website the zip file has uh like the the article seeds and some of my stories and like i'm very willing to help people for free but kind of my dream has always been to be a like a professional writer and i don't want to lose my like first publication rights and stuff so uh you're welcome to to buy my two dollar vault which i don't know like i like to think that that's not an outrageous price but yeah so if you want to like actually yeah if you want to go poke the actual yama and mess around with the plugins i had to remove some of the plugins because i wasn't sure if they came with like access to my personal amazon account so if you find anything that looks like it maybe shouldn't be there please just tell me uh koala and leah two other other mods spent like an hour helping me find all of the places where i had accidentally left in my phone number and like my kid's name so i'm a little nervous about this actually but uh you know enough people ask me questions about it that i i thought that if there was an example they could they could poke just like you're like okay but not as sort of oriented towards teaching me how teaching people how to note take like that is you are much better at that than i am but if you want to poke sort of an active vault you you can i just feel like a lot of the stuff online is great like your light kit but uh not always a working example so the teacher in me just kind of wanted to share a working example if if people wanted to to go poke what an incredible incredible resource that you're pr providing there i will be poking around i'll be getting lost in the maze poking against all the walls and seeing what doors open um we're going to kill two birds with one stone in in the next question which parts of your vault do you keep private and could you show on your end how publish works like on the obsidian side because they're yeah show which folders that you select i'm sure yeah so the stuff i keep private is um here i can show you the like it's it's in if you look at the structure note this note on the vault like i i tell you what's in all the files right like but i don't feel comfortable sharing other people's notes to me about my stories like that feels rude so i tried very hard to remove anything that was like a raw dump of a conversation i had with someone on discord about something that like i have notes about that but it it like felt rude to put those private conversations on me if not for money um and i also uh like i removed um my daily notes because there's a lot of stuff about like i'm grateful for how wonderful my son and husband were or like you know reflections on my health that just didn't feel appropriate for the internet but i um uh when koala was going through he was actually like did you mean to include these like notes about how you plan to fix your website i was like oh no that's just like task management stuff people had questions about that i'm fine to share that so there's still a bunch of stuff um that is like like it's definitely a working vault i just removed things like my son's social security card pictures and like proprietary pdfs that i downloaded legally from jstor but i don't have the rights to reprint and things like that so it is it is as close to a like working vault as i feel legally like able to give you guys i just moved i moved the stuff that would have been like unethical yeah no i i'm very excited for that especially to kind of dive a little bit deeper into on the left the johnny decimal system um that's pretty cool too i i see in the folder in the file explorer you have the vertical line you know the indent vertical line yeah and that's that's just part of your theme is that right yeah okay it's the relationship lines thing i like that i might have to do something it's nice um i they're different colors by the way yeah you can hover you can hover so you can tell like which specific like if you have them open see how one's purple and one's green it's there's some nice stuff you can do with css yeah i'm a big fan of vertical bright lines so i'm definitely going to try to incorporate that well i tried to break stuff out into snippets and like the palace in it like half the reason i published palestine in the first place was to make it easier for me to share stuff like that that's the reason i made the roundup too was because i would read something like somebody's going to ask me this later and i'm not going to have this link handy so now i can just send them to the like oh i think i mentioned that in last week's roundup you should go look if i'm like on the flyer on my phone or something because like i'll you know i'll walk the neighborhood with my son and i'm pushing him in the stroller and like i don't feel guilty being on my phone when i'm pushing him in the stroller when he's half asleep so i'll be trying to answer a couple questions but you know you know what's on the phone because of your roundup i um something that emerged in my pkm system is a more robust way to track plug-ins which is about time but now because of your roundup i'm like oh file tree alternative i will try this out at a later time and i can just put it there and feel good about that because i mean there's map edit quick add meta edit i mean there are so many extremely powerful apps i have one of those too yeah it's just crazy um and what's fun okay something that i just think is wild and fun about markdown is right now we can just go ahead and like find that file we can share it we can share it with everyone on this call and just boom like put it into the chat a markdown file um i actually will do that if that's okay with my obsidian plugins that i'm keeping track of which don't go for me go to me for plugins because i'm always like two steps by two hubs two steps behind you're very busy teaching people how to use them i get to just mess around with them but for fun that's just kind of how i'm thinking about things so i just shared that in the in the chat and everyone here who's using obsidian can just quickly open that up or use a different tool if they don't want it opened in their vault so we're getting a little tight on time i wouldn't be surprised if we go just a tiny bit over but we'll try to keep it fairly fairly tight so there was a juicy question by uh joel one of the things i struggle with is that if i have a note title that's a commonly used word i use a lot like mlc or china then outgoing links find connections to too many notes any ideas on how to make it clear that a single word is a standalone note something like babylon for instance okay so there was there was a lot there let me open up which one of these was new pain control enter okay sorry i'm still terrible with hotkeys but i have gotten a lot better than when i started out all right so the question was how did like differentiate between like when you're using the same word a lot yes especially when that same word is a standalone title like you have on screen with china and babylon okay so um what i tend to do for this is just own it uh like i don't maybe i'm hang on here let me paste that in the chat yeah like can you can you show me the chat we're getting better i'm just i'm so much better with reading it's in the chat now but joel would you also if you'd like to maybe you can add some sure so yeah hi eleanor thanks so much for all you're doing it's fantastic um so it's it's especially with the outgoing lynx um pain right because if you look in that and uh and you you're on china or you know you get or you're somewhere else and you um you have a you have a text that has china in it and you're getting like all these all these links to every place where the word china comes up and i saw you also had moc but that comes up all over the place so i think for me i sometimes struggle with being able to take advantage of outgoing links in particular with a word like that that comes up so frequently so the i guess kind of one of the reasons that i have a note for that word is because they're almost always my massive content i nick is gonna have to correct me if i completely like misbrand his system because i stole shamelessly and then did not apply it with fidelity but my um most of mine are like very kind of indexy encyclopedic things and their their purpose isn't really to look at the outgoing links like i i just never look at that for a file like that i don't um i don't care about it except for the graph view because then i can see how often i'm looking at different things um like it kind of makes like you don't make china really big and like oh right okay like i've i've done a lot with china maybe i should like hmm i could i could maybe write an article about everything i know about china like it's if you don't flag it in the title you don't flag it in the title as moc babylon you just keep the word there yeah okay you can so uh there's a workflow that i posted on the forums i don't know if flow is the right word but uh my my system is very based on the length of the title so um if you noticed some of these are very like short and almost all of the short ones are more like what nick would call an moc although i i think mine are a lot more structured than nick thinks is totally appropriate for an moc sorry nick but uh so i i it's kind of why i called them indexes for a long time but i i recently this is what i meant about making my my slip box flatter i recently merged all of my um topic notes just into the mixed in with the xettles because i started noticing that i was having like an moc that referenced another moc that referenced another moc which i think is the point um of all of the network thought and it just got to be like kind of messy where this is a this is a top level thing for this thing that's also kind of a top-level thing for this thing like with domestication and then domestication of animals and then animals uh so i kind of just shoved it all into a box and stopped worrying about it which like i know they told me to do like six months ago but i didn't want to until i was ready for it but now i'm ready for it and the the naming schema of a lot of stuff is that things start out not very atomic and then they become more and more atomic so i'll start with china and then there's these um notes that reference things for it and they become sort of more and more narrowly focused as i go but i can delete the single word do you delete the single word uh note at the end no you don't clean that up no i the the single word note is kind of the whole point it's everything that i have to say about china in one spot does that make i don't know if that makes sense i don't know if it makes sense no no no no i think i think um you know it makes a lot of sense and so by refactoring it you're always keeping it tied back to that that one word i was just wondering whether or not you wanted to flag those topic notes in a certain way so that when you're seeing the links you notice oh that's just a regular occurrence the word that's that's tying it to um an actual topic note oh i just don't link things where i don't like if you look at the backlinks a lot of them aren't linked that i i try to be clean about only linking with intentionality so like if it's in my backlinks it's because it's like a thing where i want to know that it's relevant for as opposed because the part of the problem problem part of the thing is that a lot of the story stuff that i write will like i'll have an entire like long-form story that includes things like silk and horses and and i don't want those words to get linked to my topic notes because that's not my like personal knowledge management part of my fault i i'm blurry on terminology nick is way better at that than i am but like there's there's the whole reason i use folders is because some of the stuff is like fiction and some of it is like the science of sheep and i don't necessarily need my fiction but sometimes i do so i link when i actually want that connection to be there so i can remember to follow up but it's kind of a messy system that works for me and is not always obvious to other situations and use cases yeah now that makes sense that makes sense you have intentionality with your your links and um yeah the folders are quite good too how are we doing so i want to make sure to respect everyone's time and because we start a few minutes after the hour mark i think we can go a few minutes after the next hour mark could you explain as a too long didn't read the johnny decimal system the johnny decimal system is a way of organizing all of your files in no more than like two levels deep is that the right way so like folders and then subfolders um basically using buckets that are clearly defined the whole point is that you're never in a situation where you don't know where the file goes it was originally designed for like big complex businesses and schools so that employees would know where to file something and it wasn't like i don't know how many of you guys have ever used a shared like um in intranet but like at my work there's like 17 000 folders and they're like seven piles nested and like everyone was in charge of a different thing and nobody knows where anything goes the point of the giant decimal system is to apply some order to that so that it is always extremely obvious where something lives and one of the reasons i refractor every couple of months if you look at um if you look at this compared to this you'll see that i changed stuff around is because if there was ever a moment it's the reason i flattened my vault if there's ever a moment where you're not sure which folder something should go in you should change your folders does that make sense yeah i think that's a good shorthand for the johnny decimal yeah it should be very personal it should be very like what you're doing with your vault i don't recommend doing it by topic unless you are very very very balkanized in your topics like you want to there it should never be well is is physics science or math like don't just just call it academia or something you know that's a really good point and ties into a different question out there so it's you know there's no one uh way to structure johnny decimal and probably the best way is to make it as personal as possible okay yeah like a lot of people look at my fault and go wait why do you have all of your personal stuff in one folder like that would normally like all of the stuff in a file cabinet in in fact my file cabinet um would normally be your top level stuff but this isn't this isn't the folders that i'm messing with on a daily basis they're just they're like archives right so instinctively those buckets sometimes people will use first but if that's what you're doing in your vault then absolutely it's just about making it easy to access the things that you are using often yeah let's keep this conversation going the very top one meta so okay that's going to i don't know maybe let me just speculate a little bit here that might be about knowledge management the next one dated it's a very obvious it's chronological next the next one's personal next one's interest oh wow that's going to be huge for eleanor um and then we have the slip box where we're getting all the zeddles captured now it gets into very specific things world building that's not going to be on everybody's johnny decimal system newsletters well it depends are you someone creating some sort of content well maybe you have that stories and then articles articles are kind of your sources or are they your articles these are the ones that i wrote so um ask historians our answers is not like really an article i i could just as easily have the product but then is a product a story like i don't know i know what it means so it works for me articles are everything that's not a newsletter not a story and is like a public-facing product so my reddit answers go here this is kind of like a meta folder for it but whatever and then i list uh i only list the published things that i'm linking to like i have published more than this um on my blog but every now and then i'll want to like reference one of my published articles and have it show up on the graph so um i link to where it is like in the wild but i also like to annotate sometimes this is a bad example but but sometimes i'll refer to like a specific heading because these are in their own way atomic notes so very cool um i'm just curious in the chat what would be some other folders that you might work that you might use in your world in your situation i mean we're seeing what eleanor is using we understand her use cases very broad but what might you use i don't know finances that's probably under personal if i had to guess some sort of a financial thing taxes there you have it legal taxes usually there's somewhere my husband handles most of the finances so i don't have a lot of like mostly in my email i don't i don't have a lot of like paper stuff for that so that's why it's not full just a quick one uh okay we're going to wrap this up in a few minutes but wait you have a job separate from all this oh yeah uh so like not right now um my my day job is teaching uh like i'm a middle school teacher hoping to transition to high school teacher next year but i'm currently i'm on i'm home um with my 18 month old son so i've i've been i'm a homemaker uh stay at home mom i guess but uh i don't know i i've known a lot of people who got stuck home during the pandemic and kind of went crazy with their kids because they couldn't do anything and they missed their jobs and like it's it's hard to not have any intellectual stimulation when your only conversation partner for eight hours a day is a toddler um so this is what i do when he's napping and in the evenings when my husband comes home i like try to stay interesting and like intellectually stimulated with accidents i think that you're not alone there eleanor i think that's a huge huge thing is uh you know and i i don't have children but i have a lot of nieces and nephews but just overall the idea of um that you have to keep sanity uh when you're you know um i think you know there's that quote and i'm not going to say it in completion but um there some people talk about people some people talk about events and some people talk about ideas and it's kind of tilted towards ideas when we have that quote but i will say this we should have all three we should have all three in our lives and if we're missing one of those we're not going to be i don't know feeling so complete so you know what's missing from that and when i say talk about people i i think that quote which kind of disparages that like small minds talking about people we're not saying gossip we're it's caring you know understanding you know other people in in the world society so i i think that can kind of get a bad rap but do we have all three because if we don't um maybe there's something bad with that but that's where you have so much intellectual stimulation even being at home right now and and same with my situation it's just uh this community this community is so special this this broad uh personal knowledge management space that we happen to kind of fall into it's it's quite quite amazing something special is happening i must say yeah like i've always you know like a bunch of these books that i have are christmas presents from you know before i found obsidian like it's not like i've never read i had my textbooks before but i've never been able to like process and use them so well and like one i do think it's gonna make me a better teacher because i know i usually teach on ancient civilizations in world history so it's not like this is unrelated to my day job um but uh just just finding a way to keep track of all of this is like i know people are like oh isn't that just like you know you're just you're just doing it for the sake of doing like no i i can i can tangibly point to metrics this has made me substantially more productive in ways i i value deeply i'm writing more um i'm i'm doing so much more like conversation like my newsletters um i started writing them the because i was doing research for my book and i was having conversations about it with friends and family and i wanted to have a way to record it like i started the newsletter um long before i found obsidian because it was my way of keeping track of my notes every week and what i had been researching and it'll come up in conversation um i had one about scurvy because i was looking into the dietary practices of one of the fictional people in my fantasy world and it came up in conversation over and over and over again somebody would talk about you know meat-based diets or how they were eating a bunch of protein i'd be like oh did you know that you know the maximum amount of protein that you can have in your diet like pure protein is thirty percent like oh like did you know that the the people it just kept coming up did you know that the the british when they were figuring out that limes or the limes and lemons can can stop scurvy like there's so much interesting political stuff about like it just kept coming up and now part of the reason that i moved it over to ghost is because it's i like with mailerlite where i used to have my newsletter i couldn't get to the pdf to share it with people when i was talking about it it just kept coming up these things that i've researched and i just i just want to share it like i'm a teacher right like i'm a teacher and i i have things that i think that are interesting they come up in conversation people seem to like talking to me um i feel like i have friends so i wanted to be able to more easily link people to this reference that i had like oh man like i found this article you have to read it not in a like a like just share a link what kind of way but like here's some thoughts about this thing that's relevant to our conversation and it just made it so much easier to talk to people about things that we all cared about i think you know um there's something there about triangulation uh going back to there's a thing there's like a topic a concept out there and then there's the person that you kind of enjoy talking about the thing because it gives you perspective and then you're over here and if you have those two dots and there's you then you really kind of understand what's happening and uh that's i don't know it's kind of a cool thing so you're definitely um a valued and treasured triangulation voice so to speak and we look to eleanor to kind of get your thoughts on anything from chestnuts to scurvy i just want to give you a huge round of applause let's do both a physical and a virtual round of applause for eleanor you guys are great by the way like i love this community i would not put this kind of time into newsletters for people that i didn't like yeah i get so many nice emails about like you know helping people because so many different like nobody has time to keep up with the discord unless you read as fast as i do and like i read really fast um i read i read a textbook like this a paper physical textbook and took notes on it in one weekend because it was due back at the library that's the um you guys have my notes now civilizations of africa um 1800 or you know way far back to 1800 that was a physical textbook that i got from interlibrary loan and took notes on post-its and physically typed it up in one weekend could have never done that before obsidian and the like whole heading method i use those notes all the time i'm so glad that i have to share my notes with you guys i can like actually reference stuff and you know what i'm talking about yeah i'm just resharing your newsletter link um we've shared the the publish link a lot which i have to sink my teeth into as well i'm trying to think other reminders before we get everyone on back to their sundays uh i don't know the recording where what i'm pretty responsive if you have other questions i'm like i'm around yes you definitely oh there's um i turned on i turned on comments for the blog uh it's a new feature for ghost so if it breaks let me know but um i thought it might be nice for you guys to like actually target questions in one one place instead of the fire hose of discord so use them if if you're interested in that uh i promise to be as responsive there as i am everywhere else it feels weird to say it like that but i don't know i feel like i have a pretty good response rate i i answer people so this is pretty great the next lighthouse session well i know we'll definitely have ryan j a murphy another moderator in the obsidian forums and he's going to be talking well hopefully about integrated thinking environments and and how obsidian fits that and with all the plugins um very you know very insightful person so i'm ex excited to have him i know somewhere down the road i don't know how soon but uh the max max sparky will be another lighthouse session i'm not sure if it's gonna be in the next few weeks or if it'll just be before the end of the year but it'll be nice to have david and there are a couple other people lined up so whether or not um they'll be in the next two to four weeks which is like this jam-packed time there'll be also a lot of other sunday live sessions but you'll hear more about that i don't want to talk too much about it now um i just want to thank you for how responsive you've remained uh where i've kind of had to take a backseat seat at times but last lastly let's just thank everyone who showed up i think we're over i think we've got to about 110 and even though we're 15 minutes over we still have you know 60 plus so pretty fun there thank you for your time your patience and just being here your questions your leaning forward attitude and uh yeah let's just keep doing our things together and find great ways to fall into each other's orbits thanks for like having me also i don't know if you guys know this but nick taught me everything i know about personal knowledge management like i had never heard of all of the people think of his greats before i found obsidian like i came in because somebody from my writing community was like hey you could use this to manage your world building like nick taught me everything i know except for all the stuff that i already knew well i think what's fun about uh you know both both you and i is we just kind of like walked we're in a big party and we just kind of walked backwards into a room and then people started like enjoying things that we were saying but you know it just kind of happened organically and that's what i like about everyone here is it's just this organic very natural thing happening and hopefully continues [Music] you
