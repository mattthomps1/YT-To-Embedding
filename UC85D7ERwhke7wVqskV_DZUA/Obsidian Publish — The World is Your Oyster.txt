it seems just like last week i was sharing 
with you the new graph features in obsidian   and the two ways that they slightly changed the 
game for me here i am again because obsidian   has just released obsidian publish which 
allows you to take your plain text files   hit a button and immediately your ideas are on the 
web and they're not just ideas on the web they're   your linked ideas they have the same structure as 
obsidian offline so again this is like a subtle   game changer and in the following video i'm 
going to show you how to take advantage of that   and at the very end i'm going to show you 
how you can start right now doing this   so hey join me in the following video i'm going to 
walk through obsidian publish for the first time   and we're going to see the different ways 
that we can start to apply this cool feature   and at the very end of the video i'm going to walk 
you through how you can activate this setting and   start publishing your linked ideas right now 
hey just in case you forgot i'm nick milo with   linking your thinking where we talk about the how 
and why of making meaningful notes let's dive in okay so let's check this thing out we start in 
the light kit right i'm going to publish all of   this online so what you do is you go to settings 
account excuse me about make sure hey version is   0.9.2 or higher and receive 
insider builds is activated   then you go to plug-in scroll all the way to the 
bottom and publish let's toggle this thing on so   you probably saw this airplane note appear let's 
click on it it loads so i did this one other time   so i have this site but let's look it out if i 
wanted to change the site options you click this   button the site name let's call it light kit 
let's make the home page file the start here   file let's go with the light mode for now let's 
show navigation why not let's show the graph   that all looks pretty good so let's just go back 
the next thing you can do is hit the switch cite   button and then if you hit the edit site id this 
is part of the url so it's not the site name but   it's part of the url is the site id apparently so 
let's just go light dash kit it looks like we can   only use letters numbers and dashes so i like 
that let's cancel and we're pretty good there   click publish it loads i did have a change to 
timestamps i don't care hey this is exactly a   good example i want the change to populate 
so that's all good and boom hit publish   all that your files will load in this case i 
only had one file that had an update to it so   only that thing is going to update and what 
i did is i deleted it out of the light kit   and in the meantime let's go check 
this link out so click on that and boom here it is this is the light 
kit online using obsidian publish   so pretty cool we can zoom in on the graph we have 
a table of content that's showing your headers   and then we can just kind of dive into 
different notes so let's imagine we started on   the home note and this has a bunch of links to my 
main home maps let's just kind of dive into to uh   concepts so if we dig into concepts then we 
can dig into something else so then we could   and by the way look at the table of contents 
tons of nice headers we could dig into flow and then we have something i wrote 
some ideas it's a placeholder   we can see the links so this is pretty 
cool right i mean we put something online   it's here other people can look at it and all of 
a sudden i'm able to do what andy matushak does   and you're able to do what andy matushak can 
do who's andy let's check it out let's go   and type in so you've probably come across this 
at some point if you're into personal knowledge   management but andy matushak has his notes live 
here and so if i click on let's say evergreen note   writing it opens up in a new sleeve a panel a pane 
and then i can keep on clicking open new notes and   reading these new notes and then i can hit shift 
and then the scroll wheel kind of scroll back   and forth so that's pretty awesome and it's been 
out for a while i don't know when andy started it   but i know it dates back into 2019 and so now we 
can be that we can do that i mean they won't be as   polished and beautiful as andy's notes but it's a 
start it's a start to get other people looking at   your material and so it could be very polished 
material or you can be working with the garage   door open a good example of that and an example 
of something you can do with obsidian publish   is to create a choose your own adventure sort 
of story and a good example i have for that   is the flow creation map of content so this is 
something i created for some friends and family   a couple years ago because i'm obsessed with flow 
that that concept by popularized by mihai chiksen   mihai and so what what does this look like this is 
the map of content let's start with flow map and   you know you read this thing you're kind 
of you're kind of ingesting it digesting it   um there are a couple links you can click 
on that's the choose your adventure so   let's just choose flow creation theory 
and then that throws us into this note   we can read up on this note i mean i'm really 
amazed at how gorgeous this looks online   um then it gets to something that's the four 
factors of flow and the whole idea around this   flow creation uh practical guide was that you kind 
of troubleshoot your issues it's like hey why am i   bouncing out of flow is it because i don't have 
direction in my life i don't have strong goals   is it because i'm lacking the ability to focus is 
it a lack of enthusiasm is it a lack of energy so   in this case it's let's say let's go with 
direction it's a lack of direction goals   and so it's kind of a way to troubleshoot problems 
and then you can be prescriptive to your own needs   the whole point being is this is another 
use of obsidian publish where you can   share something with your friends 
and family and say hey check this out   or you just had a great conversation out in public 
somewhere or online it doesn't matter you can say   hey check out this link because so this is pretty 
cool each note has its unique url i mean right   so now you can share these on twitter through 
text message whatever it is whenever you say to   yourself in conversation you say to somebody else 
hey that reminds me of something i wrote about   boom send them a link so instead of sending 
a link outside to some random amazon book like this awesome book daring greatly by brene 
brown you can actually just link to content that   you've already you know that you've already made 
these notes and then they can go on a wild ride   and it's not just some amazon review it's 
actually your thoughts with the material so then   that person comes back to you and the conversation 
that you have goes to a whole other level because   you're on the same wavelength talking about 
the same ideas and they challenge some of your   thoughts and they agree with other thoughts and i 
mean that's a good way to go and that's the power   of linking your thinking and now we can share 
the this linked network of thought with other   people so i mean i'm just super excited 
about the functionality involved with this   all these different notes that you can go to 
concept expansion click on that that leads to   other things so pretty exciting i would 
say so as you can see obsidian publish   is super powerful and i want to talk about 
how you can get started with it right now okay just to recap to make sure i didn't miss 
anything what can you do with obsidian publish   why is this so cool now if you're familiar with 
andy matushak you can do the same thing he does   you can publish your notes online doesn't 
mean they're going to look as nice as his   but it's a start and then you can share 
your ideas with others get feedback   and it's really cool i have to tell you once 
it's your notes it really feels different so that's what i'm going to do with the light 
kit at this point it's been downloaded 4 200 plus   times but now with obsidian publish i can just 
have a public file that you can look at and refer   to at any time that you want to look a little bit 
more into hey how can we use maps of content also   you saw the sneak peek into how 
we can do a choose your adventure   linked sort of journey i'm really excited to see 
where this avenue goes there's a real art to it   what i showed you wasn't much of an art with the 
flow creation choose your adventure but what you   can do i'm excited for or if you're collaborating 
with other people obsidian publish can be your   online knowledge base it can be the directory 
where you go to get all that information same   thing if you do have clients that you're working 
with that can be a place of documentation where   you show everything that they need to know it's 
so quick to edit that's the real advantage here so who is obsidian publish really for i think 
we're going to find out but my guess is is for   people that don't know how to program who don't 
want to mess with websites what they want to do is   stay with the signal and not the noise and what 
is th what is the signal that's writing that's   creating that's linking that's connecting 
ideas and sharing them with other people   so in my estimation obsidian publish is really 
great because you don't have to worry about   anything to do with squarespace with wix with 
wordpress with all this html and these pages   you just worry with your offline obsidian vault 
then you select the files or the folder that   you want to publish you hit the button and 
boom your ideas your thoughts are out there   you make revisions you make changes great that's 
fine hit the button boom those changes are pushed   online and then after a few minutes those those 
revisions are out there so it's pretty wild   you might be wondering but is it private hey 
i'm not a programmer i'm not a coder but what   i've heard reassures me that your notes are 
still private they're still protected and   if you have any doubt at all you take the notes 
that you want to publish online which obviously   aren't private if you want to publish them online 
and then you just move them to a separate vault   that's being triple safe i'm not that concerned 
so i'm just going to select the notes that i   need to uh that are the light kit and i can 
just hit publish on that but the question of   is it safe the answers that i've heard reassure 
me but because i'm not the most technical person   i can't explain them to you right now so 
there'll be more information that comes out   and like i promised at the top of the video 
i want to share with you how you can start   sharing your ideas with the world right 
now not just ideas but your linked   ideas your linked thoughts so what 
we do is we go to obsidian.md pricing   and that'll take us to this window and what 
you want to do if you're able to and you want   it right now is support the team i'm not a part 
of the team i just think the team is amazing and   i love supporting them i love what obsidian has 
done for me so if you can and you want to take   advantage of publish now then hit the catalyst 
option and it's just a one-time payment of 25   and then you can play around with this 
really really cool feature now long term   there this will be an add-on service so obsidian 
publish will have a monthly cost to it and   this is how obsidian i mean the question was like 
how are they actually planning to make money the   app is always free all these core functionalities 
are always free so how are they making money   and obsidian publish is one of those ways so 
instead of using squarespace and paying whatever   that amount is what instead of using wix same 
situation the idea here is that you use publish   and the beauty of this this route is now you 
can use your notes your linked notes in plain   text and use publish and they look beautiful so 
that's really the value proposition here i think   they're going to be quite successful i'm looking 
forward to see how different people use publish   because as i mentioned i only have a couple ideas 
and it'll be very exciting to see where it goes   as for me as i've mentioned i'm a big andy 
matushak fan so i'll be doing something similar   with the light kit it'll be public and it will be 
iterating updating and hopefully providing some   some ideas for everyone who visits it hey so if 
you enjoyed this video please subscribe below   i just started recently and i've 
been overwhelmed by the response   there's obviously a demand for working with ideas 
with linking our thinking and i'm more than happy   to keep these videos coming your support your 
encouragement in the comments has been greatly   greatly appreciated i hope you have found 
some value and i'll see you in the next video you
