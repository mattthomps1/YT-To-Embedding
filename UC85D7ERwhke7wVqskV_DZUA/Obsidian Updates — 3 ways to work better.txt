[Music] hey another week and another obsidian update these developers are crazy this is version 0.9.3 and no it's not an amazing new graph view it's not being able to publish your notes online in fact this update is just about three tiny features but interestingly enough each feature can actually subtly change your workflow and the last one which is the most innocuous can have the biggest impact to what you do so in order we're going to cover saved workspaces hover preview the new functionality built around it and then finally this thing that's called copy search results that doesn't sound very exciting right but it will change how you can approach linking your thoughts so let's dive in okay the first feature we want to explore is saved workspaces let's check this out so we're in the light kit over here i'm at the home note let's go to settings and check out plugin now last time we scrolled to the bottom to activate the publish feature now in this version 093 we have workspaces so i've toggled this on and we can notice now we have a workspace icon that appears in the sidebar ribbon so let's check this out i've pre-made three now when you get started with your own workspaces the first thing you should do is save a base setting so right when you open it for the first time i've already done this but base example we'll call this right save it that way you have your base saved and you can always go back to it so now why would we want to use workspaces in fact that's a great question for you to ask yourself when would you want to use a separate workspace i've identified a few and here's the cool thing before we dive into what those are we can go to settings hotkeys and let me just type in works okay there we go and i can create some hotkeys for these workspaces so load workspace i'm going to make this shift escape for now so now all of a sudden i'm doing my thing i'm working but i want a different view a different workspace so i hit shift escape and these are the workspaces so let's check out writing so that flattens out the sides and i'm just focused on one screen i can just focus on my writing but if we want to go back hotkey back to base all right are we starting to see how this is pretty cool like the power that we can achieve with with this now here's another one though the local graph being so powerful maybe you want sort of a local graph view where it's this big part of your sidebar and then you have everything else over here and then you can scroll you can do your work you know you can click on a few different things that you have open and see what happens so that's saved workspaces now let's hop over into hover previewed what does this mean hover preview we had page preview before and hover previews the same thing except now we have more options so let's say if i hover over levels of magnification the first thing is i can scroll through alright that's pretty cool i can also hover on any link and that link appears so we have these sort of infinite windows that pop up and now from here i can look see if there's another link i want to click on yin and yang and then i can go to seasons and so do i mean how cool is this this sort of infinite pop-up window pretty cool when you're just going down these bunny trails but you don't want to lose the main point right so if i just kind of hover away the main page is still here so it allows us to quickly hop off to explore bunny trail and then we come back to the main point and then we're back where we want to be so we don't lose our place we can just quickly travel and then travel back so i'm finding that to be pretty important now here's something that's really cool i'm going to hover over refraction thinking and actually i have the page right here as well so this is refraction thinking and here's what i did i put in a checkbox i can check it right see that testing surely i can't just click on oh my so what's going on so if i hover over refraction thinking i can actually look at that i can actually check the box off from the hover mode there are some workflows where that's going to be pretty cool pretty valuable i'm not huge into the check boxes with my idea management but a lot of people are so that's two down we covered save workspaces and we covered all the new features of hover preview now we're on to that sneaky one that actually packs a powerful punch and what is that it's copy search results so let's check it out so checking this out the first thing we want to do that i want to do i want to change my workspace so i hit my hotkey and i'll go back to the base workspace all right so what we want to do is go to search and let's check out i i know what i want to search for i want to search for flow because whenever i can get a chance to plug mihai's work this is mihai chiksen mihai and it is really the foundation foundational work when it comes to being in the zone um experiencing optimal optimal experiences in life and uh whenever i can reference this book i do because it kicks kicks butt so i just searched for flow let me collapse the results which you can do by clicking there now check out all these things like how am i supposed to make sense of them now i can you know uncollapse and i can kind of scroll through and that's valuable absolutely it's very valuable but this is what's cool now i can copy search results and so the first time you open it up it'll it'll look like this just a bunch of text now you can show the full path so you can see that this note now shows the folders it's buried in now this is kind of an example i don't prefer using folders in this way let's turn off show path i don't find much value in it you might link style definitely wikilink for me which gives us the brackets now here how do you want to copy this i think it's kind of nice to copy with the dash i mean not always but i think with these big searches this is kind of what i'd like to do so there we go now if i didn't want to copy everything i could just highlight the ones i want to copy and then just hit copy in this case though i do want to copy everything so it doesn't matter what i do here i'm just going to hit copy results and the results are copied we can see that cool now let's open my daily note and i kind of prepped it just with this title but here's what i want you to do if you use this feature think of a tag any tag that you want to use the one that i'm going to say is my best practice is workbench because a new workbench is a place to sort discard and rearrange stuff and maybe it becomes a map of content in mlc maybe it doesn't but so here we go we copied all that content and then boom we paste check this out isn't this awesome all of these all these amazing details so now if i if i'm in edit mode like i am i can just hit command as i'm hovering over and then i can see what's inside so what i want to do now though is i don't want to just keep all this and we'll get to the one caveat the thing that you have to be careful of when you use this tool and it's kind of we'll get there though in a second so the first thing is as i'm looking at these i might say okay these are big maps i really don't need those i don't want those so what am i trying to accomplish here and then you make your category and you say category you know z and then you decide let's say you really really don't need that many so you get to this point now another hotkey that i'll just throw out there but you can swap these lines so i have it programmed to option or alt up and down so whatever i'm on i can move four virtues up and down so this is a really quick way to develop some relational positioning right and that's one of the beauties of these higher order notes like maps of content now there's a reason i call this initial copy and pasting when we use this new feature copy search results there's a reason i use the tag workbench and not moc it's because this stuff can get really messy really fast so i'll give you the super fast example you know remember i can paste everything like this now and look at all these links that it forms if we go to the actual graph view i have some filters going let me get rid of that so really quickly if you do this let's see if we can find what we just created all right this is the new daily note that has all the links i pasted now look at this graph i have to tell you this daily note should not have this much attention brought to it it's just a workspace it's a workbench so imagine if i did this a few more times my graph would be a mess and it would not be a helpful mess it would be a mess of of all these links that i've dirtied up my my uh digital library with so what i'm saying is you have to be careful the best way if you're in a rush and you're not able to completely sort everything and discard everything is to give it the tag workbench or something like workbench because now when i go to graph view let's say it's all a mess because i've been working really fast now i can start to clean it up and the easiest way now is i can just search that tag workbench and for this example i just have this one but i can find all of these big workbench notes with all these links that i haven't really organized and discarded and then i can make sure that i'm keeping things organized and tidy i hope you enjoyed this first look video at obsidian 0.9.3 it's covering workflow and workflow is really cool i think we can become sort of obsessed with workflow and it's not healthy you always want to remember why you're doing it what you're trying to accomplish and so in the linking your thinking workshop which starts the end of october we cover how you can create your custom personalized personal knowledge management system it's not cookie cutter it's not just follow these three or four folders and you're fine this is built specifically for your needs i'm not going to cover it now there'll be more on this to come but i just wanted to throw another heads up that registration registration's opening soon and be on the lookout i'll see you later
