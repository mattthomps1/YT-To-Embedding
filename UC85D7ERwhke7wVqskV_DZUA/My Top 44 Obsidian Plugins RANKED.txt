foreign has over 800 Community plugins and I've looked through them all in this video we're going to look at my top 44 ranked plugins not just Community plugins not just the core plugins but even these shadowy special functions as well through the chaos I have created my top 44. let's go through them one at a time now on my screen you can see that I've opened up obsidian flight school you can learn more about flight school in the description below it's a great way to learn obsidian it's an immersive educational experience where you get Hands-On reps going through each exercise in each command enough of that once you're at obsidian flight school arrival we're going to click on the hangar and this is the main place to go now I'm going to go specifically to the instruments wing and over to plugins you can just see how expansive flight school is for the purposes of this video we're going to jump into my top 44 obsidian plugins n functions ranked are you ready I'm about to open it up right now here we go number one what did you think it was going to be probably not this but here we are so I'm going to first pin this note and then open it up in its command palette command palette what is it it's command P if I hit command p i can immediately get all the commands in obsidian as you download new plugins that's even more important because each Community plugin has its own set of commands sure I've hotkeyed a lot of them but every now and then I just want to hit command p and think what was that toggle pin oh yeah there it is and then I can pin this note so it won't go away but let me go ahead and unpin it command palette is a must that is why it is 100 out of 100 the most important obsidian plug-in and this is a core plug-in so you don't have to do anything it's already there waiting for you tied with command palette is number two the quick switcher the quick switcher instead of hitting command p on a Mac or Ctrl p on Windows you hit command o or Ctrl o on Windows this will open up a window where you can either find or create any note as fast as you can type this is phenomenal let's try that again command o and let's say I forgot and I'll hit 22 because that's all I can remember oh wow I have a top 22 Community plugins ranked as well in obsidian flight school and that's when I recognized wait a second I don't want to just look at Community plugins because the thing about obsidian is there's a great balance between the community and the core developers think of it as an estuary where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico it's great for biodiversity great for emergent life to form what I'm trying to get at is when the community developer innovate and come up with something there's a back and forth with the core developers and if there's enough interest the core team can Sherlock the community plugin and make it a part of core now when I was making the community list I recognized that one of my favorite plugins had been sherlocked and so therefore when I was making a list only on community plugins it felt like whoa I was no longer able to call attention to something I love so much and we'll get into that later on but that's why I felt the need to have the top 44 all obsidian plugins plus some special functions okay enough of the backstory into number three we have backlinks let's open it up nothing is more fundamental to linked based Knowledge Management than the backlink so what does the backlink look like how can you find it we have a couple hotkeys programmed in flight school I can hit command option b and that will open up all the backlinks right here however most of you are going to be more familiar with expanding the pane and then you can probably find backlinks here that's how we make connections between notes this is how we think this is how our brain works by making connections between ideas it's phenomenal that now we can do it externally and we can save our progress grow these ideas over time so as we look at our rankings of course backlinks gets a 99. now the new 99 this is new as of just a couple months ago is canvas a core plug-in by obsidian canvas is allowing us to think visually in wonderful ways in this text-based program now we have the ability to have an infinite canvas to spatially think now in this obsidian Flight School I just linked to the kind of Flagship video on obsidian canvas on YouTube but I also wanted to include something to get our hands dirty so if you click on this one you can immediately open up the canvas note that I used in that YouTube video it's here it's embedded within this obsidian flight school but regardless you can really look around and see everything now you'll notice I'm using stacked tabs and if you go over here I can unstack tabs or I could use a nice little hotkey and it's really important when we're working on something where we want more screen real estate so boom I just toggled stacked tabs now look at this look how beautiful I mean you could just go around you can dive into all sorts of things this is amazing look how Snappy this is I can't get over how Amazing Canvas is I will I have already used it for multiple use cases it's helped design the link in your thinking Workshop the the series of letters that I'm writing to everyone on the newsletter it has been extremely impactful to Think Through complex use cases to design it to think it all out and boom it's right here visually that I can always return to obsidian canvas for the win it's also a 99. okay I'll try to go a little bit faster search search is a plug-in believe it or not it's a core plug-in it's been here from the start how could it not be a 99 but I do want to say it's a plug-in it's right here so we take search for granted but we shouldn't because it isn't always there not every program is going to have it or not every program is going to have it as powerfully but we have search here it is it's a 99. now let's talk about daily notes there are four ways that we use to organize everything I won't go into details too much right now but the first one is space we organize things spatially number two is time we organize anything by chronology of when we encountered it or when it made an impact on us or when it came out if it was a movie or a song daily notes allows us to open up time stamped notes and that we can really use that to our advantage for remembering things whether or maybe it's just journaling starting the day prioritizing now when you pair this with the next pair of plugins that's when it gets really powerful now we can use the plugin and this is the first look at this this is the first Community plugin the rest of these are core plugins and this next one is calendar so let's open up my note on calendar and let's go back toggle toggle stack tabs and I have a whole video here I'm going to mute it just so it's not overlapping but there are amazing things that you can do with navigating between notes I'll explain it a little bit more just by saying that if we were to create some daily notes check this out when you combine calendar and it's I guess sister or brother plugin periodic notes you can do some pretty amazing things let's see if I can just do this off the cuff I don't know if this will be a success or not but let me go ahead and create a daily note this is today's date this is the date that I'm recording this now if I want to create another note over here using the plug-in calendar I can just go ahead and click around to these different dates I can click into the future and create a date and you can notice that these new notes are populating here so I'm just going to type in some gobblygoop then I'll go back to today's date and I'll do the same thing pretty cool right and then I can go over here and I can type the same stuff so pretty cool I think now what's even better is when you pair that with periodic notes so let's go ahead and open periodic notes now we've already opened today's daily note with a hotkey I didn't tell you what it was but I have this hotkeyed to command D on a Mac or Ctrl D on Windows what's so nice about that is no matter where I am I get overwhelmed all I need to know is I can hit command D and immediately go back to my daily note in this case I might be keeping a daily log or I might have the three big rocks that I want to accomplish or I just want to journal something maybe I'm doing interstitial journaling or it's the end of the day and I just kind of want to reflect on how everything went there are plenty of reasons to open a daily note now what I also find useful and where periodic notes comes in so handy is that you can actually jump between daily notes now in the past if you were to jump between let's say today's date and go to the ninth it would create this note to the 10th first which was kind of annoying but in this case let's just close everything really fast now if I open today's daily note I used hotkey if I jump I can hit a different hotkey and immediately jump back to the ninth or I can jump forward to the 11th or I can jump forward to the 24th so look at that and I can jump all the way back to the fourth too so being able to quickly when you think to yourself oh what what day was it well I don't quite know but it was around this area then you can just go ahead and click in that area using the plugging or the calendar plugin and then using the periodic notes plugin you can quickly jump through different notes now for that I use the plugins the commands that I've chosen are the semicolon and the apostrophe they're next to each other on the keyboard so it's very easy to just hit the left one or hit the right one to jump forward and back so look at that another 99 but that's the last of the 99s my friends now we're going to go into the first 98 so let me just clean up the screen a little bit we'll close that for now and let's check out tag Wrangler so first of all the death of tags are greatly exaggerated they are greatly exaggerated and why is that well it's because they weren't being used properly and the software we had didn't allow us to use that properly now with tag Wrangler and eventually I hope that obsidian obsidian's core developers Sherlock this capability but what makes tag Wrangler so good is hey let's try this one out together this is another built-in exercise to obsidian flight school but in this case I'm going to right click on this plugin over here and I'm going to rename it see what happens when I change it from plugin to plugins see what happens 122 files have been updated that tells you how many plugins that we have in flight school by the way each plugin out of the 800 we've chosen 122 fantastic number to to have some sort of information on we've we've risen it up and said this is important if you're curious about plugins you might want to check it out okay so now with that in mind we've just been able to rename immediately 122 notes using tag Wrangler it went into each of those notes and looked for the tag and modified it so let's change it back look keep your eyes right here okay this is going to happen simultaneously in a 121 other notes boom it's back what gets even more powerful is when you do this with notes the other part of okay let me say let me explain this a little bit more the other part that's so exciting about tags is that you can actually Nest them I can't believe software took so long to get to the point where we could have nested tags what I'm trying to get at is see this note slash boat now if I want to change the title of this let's say I want to rename boat I can rename it both and it's going to make that change it'll percolate through all the notes in this case just one and I can just as easily name that back or let's delete that one maybe I want plugin to be how about this one let's this is risky right you have interface maybe you want interface to be underneath plugin so let's go to rename and then I'm just going to do that so let's hit plugin slash interface and then you're about to see something Wild look how quickly that changed now the plug-in count is up and now we have this interface count now I can click on this and immediately get the search for all of those over in the search core plugin now let's change that back and all I have to do is get rid of the parent tag and then go ahead and hit enter and now we're back anyways you can tell how much that I think tag Wrangler is phenomenal it just might change your expectations of what tags can do for you okay moving on The Best Is Yet To Come when I look at note refactor I Wonder Why didn't it get the 99 if you're looking at these three that are bolded they are my top three plugins Community plugins of all of them and my top three and a half include periodic notes but I do consider that a sibling of the calendar it's actually by the same developer as we'll get to later in this video now let's open up note refactor so here we go note refactor this is one of my top three and a half plugins because refactoring knowledge is the way what's so cool about this when you're making any sort of note and half the time we don't know what we're going to say or what idea becomes too long and needs to be split off so how do you do that well how about you just highlight everything and then split it off I just gave myself a link to this new note see how fast that was when you incorporate this workflow you start truly getting closer to the speed of thought and it's just phenomenal now if I don't want to do this that's okay I'll delete this note and then over here obsidian maintains the history per tab that means in this tab it remembers where it was so I'll just hit undo and it's back so we cover extensively how to refactor notes the fastest way the best ways the variety of ways because there are so many so I just want to really Point your attention to how powerful note refactoring is now you might be asking what is refactor even mean think of refactoring as restructuring so if you format to note like if I made this bold that's formatting but when you are and I could reformat this note and I can get get rid of this I could hit undo but when you are refactoring you are not formatting text on the screen your your structuring ideas your sense making through the process of moving text around I I think this is a really profound point and that's why I want to bring it up okay next one data view eventually this might be replaced sooner than later by a different plug-in by This brilliant person called Data core stay tuned for that one in the meantime data view is what it allows us to do phenomenal things now see all these 44 plugins how about we take the other what is that 88 I might be doing my math wrong probably um and let's check them all out in obsidian plugins data views so this is a collection of data views where you can look at all of the plugins by different criteria within this obsidian flight school product let's check it out by developer so let's find Michael it's alphabetical so if we go to the M's there's Michael plug-in data View so what's cool about this is you can actually see maybe your favorite plugin and you can see who it's by and here here let's kind of go a little meta look at nothing is lost they've created two that I really enjoy I'm going to hover over hover editor and we'll get to hover editor but look at this I don't even have to click anything it popped up this note and I can immediately start typing in it this is insane This truly is insane but let's take it even further so let's jump into hover editor because if you have obsidian flight school you might notice that in each plugin there is a go to button and you might be thinking to yourself oh that's going to take me to the Internet it's going to take me onto GitHub and then I'll get lost in technical stuff no you won't this is going to take you immediately to the community plugins settings screen do you see how powerful this is I have to I have to show it to you again because I hope your jaw just dropped we did a live session recently where I showed this and I saw I saw the Jaws dropping on screen literally let's look at one that I don't have installed how about um metadata menu so we have a note by my co-pilot for obsidian flight school 2.0 Keaton but if I click go to here I can immediately install it that easy and then you can test it out the the alternative version is you know you find a plug-in someone mentions it you have to make sure that you go over two settings and then you have to find Community plugins you have to hit browse you have to start looking that works I mean that works quite well but this is another way of Discovery and I find it to be extremely powerful so you can actually go from the data views anywhere you can find a plugin and then you can say Argent or this was amazing by Argentina also known as Argenta argentum depending on where you are and you can click open and then you can see exactly the details around this plugin let's take it even further if you did click on the repository it will take you to a GitHub page now early in this video I was talking about the beautiful balance between the community developers and plugins and the core developers and the core plugins we need to have a thriving thriving ecosystem between the two and the best way that you can help this Thrive is by going so check this out by going to each person's GitHub that you really like when you like that plug-in see if they have a way that they can be sponsored send them anything if you have any spare spare money send them the five dollars buy them the digital coffee all this helps encourage them to do this work that comes from within they're not doing it to make money they're doing it because they are inspired they're just naturally driven to do something to scratch their own itch but to maintain a plug-in is another matter so that's why if you can you know wherever you have lists of plugins wherever you might have to go maybe you go to settings you go to community plugins and you just say I really really like the work that jolt is doing well go to Excalibur and in my case I'm going to use obsidian plugins dataview and it's a result so he should be at the bottom there he is scally draw and then I can hit go to that takes me immediately to where it lives within the community plugins within your obsidian application and then go ahead and click on the GitHub I'm not going to do that now but there will be a way that you could probably go ahead and sponsor jolt for his amazing work taking excalibraw in importing it into obsidian are you curious what excal draw can do well how about I show you here's an example right here so let's open up this because I want I want you to know how amazing this is now I'm in stack tabs so what should I do right now I want to see this I want it to be bigger I should toggle stacked tabs in flight school that command is command s but if you can't remember go up here and you can unstack the tabs so let me hit that now wow now I can look at this I can see exactly what is what and it gets even better it's fully ready for you to edit tab groups move tab groups look at that they're moving we can edit this stuff right now it's live it's ready to go so shout out to jolt thank you for an amazing plug-in you might be wondering did this make the top 44 stay tuned in the meantime let me toggle back to stack tabs and let's go on to the next one sink this is a core feature and it's sync so this is a paid service but it's extremely valuable and I want you to know that you don't have to use any add-on service this is an obsidian add-on but I highly highly recommend it you could use dropbox that's another paid service you can use iCloud but nothing works as brilliantly as sync and we'll get into that more in Flight School itself there's a nice video that we're about to embed and that takes you through what that how that actually works to keep your data and information safe and really up to date really synced fantastically there are some issues with Dropbox iclouds is better than Dropbox but still nothing is as smooth as sync if you're curious where to find that in the core plugins it's going to be down here make sure sync is turned on and then you can go and dive deeper into it which we won't do now but being able to sync your notes across multiple devices whether it's a main desktop whether it's a laptop whether it's your mobile device it is priceless now I know I shouldn't be doing this but every now and then I'll be lying in bed and I'll have my phone in my hand I don't recommend this but it's nice to know that I can add notes while they're still my mind get them down without having to go to the the desktop or boot everything up it just it's a nice easy way to record something and then put the phone away go back to the bed and then know that it's there waiting for me when I open up my desktop the next day all right we are flying along now you might be wondering is Nick really going to cover all 44 plugins and functions I don't know I really don't I'm doing this in one full long take so stay tuned and we'll see how my energy levels end up doing now I've already talked about this one once it's not a plug-in it's not really I mean it's a hotkey but it's not a hotkey what is it well let's call it for lack of a better term a function and that is stacked tabs just so you know there was something that was like text stack tabs and that was my fourth I had my top four plugins for since obsidian came out for basically two full years I had my same top four plugins but then stack tabs essentially was sure locking the old thing called sliding panes so I love stack tabs I use it all the time and we have a you can check out the command so there's a function here you can check out the command you can watch the video but this is how I quickly change navigation so this would be stacked and this would be traditional pretty cool right so now I'm going to hit my special hotkey to close that tab close the next Tab and now we're back that was like a look Mom no hands but there's one hand on the other keyboard now let's get into live preview live preview it's a 96. this is one of those things that obsidian the developers have done to me and many of us multiple times they've given us something we didn't know how badly we needed it that's certainly the case with canvas and it's so true with live preview now before live preview by the way this this is live preview now if you want me to go into Source mode edit mode like the sort the source part of edit mode then let me do that right now so you can see this is what the back end looks like now it's still human readable you and I we can read this but yes there is visual clutter and so it is beautiful it's so so nice to remove that now if you want to know what it's really going to look like if you had to export this markdown note into a PDF then you could go into reading view so let me do that now this is reading View and this is live preview reading View live preview can you I I that's so similar it's phenomenal now that might seem like well duh and if you're coming late to the party it's not going to be a big deal to you but if you had to experience what it was like before this when you had to always edit with all the markdown syntax in your face wow this is so nice I remember trying to convince myself I remember this vividly oh I don't need Life preview I like toggling back and forth it's a it's a nice context switch it allows me to see things in a different light well there's some truth to that but I'm in live preview 90 of the time moving on then next top plugin at 95 is templates so this is a core template we have a video on it in flight school you want to have a few trusty templates handy so in flight school there are only a few that we have like you can tell that this is probably a template so if I were to create a new note in a new tab group let's just give it a random title I could go ahead and pull up templates and you can see there are specific templates in here so at the click of a button I can pull them up and I can quickly choose plugin and now this is what we get pretty cool right I'll delete that close that tab templates are fantastic for speeding up your workflow once you know what your workflow is so it takes a while to get templates the big common mistake with this is trying to use someone else's templates looking at them is okay playing with them so you can modify them that's okay but what's not okay and what's the biggest trap in Knowledge Management in general is trying to adopt somebody else's structure structure must be earned you can't create something that's super complex without it starting super simple structure must be earned and that's very true with templates so just know like if you receive a templates pack this goes for other programs too you know notion is really famous for their templates that's that's great but you have to make it your own and it's not going to work out of the box it must be earned for you if you're familiar with what we're doing here it's often called PKM personal Knowledge Management don't forget that P it's personal it has to be tailored to you or else it's going to fall like a house of cards all right let's move on let's go into files so this is a 94. this is like search this see this tab right here called files this is a plug-in I've talked about this before in my love letter to obsidian but the way that the developers went about designing this application was to consider each functionality its own plugin search is a plugin start notes is a plugin definitely definitely not in my top 44. this is in the bottom 44 to be honest it is just a essentially a weak tag that's all a start is the only reason I have it here is just to help out people beginning their obsidian journey I never go to the Stars tab personally now files is another plugin and it's a tab right here okay moving on I've already spoiled this one for you but this plugin hover editor so I can be in this note and without touching anything if I'm in live preview I excuse me I have to hold down command or control on Windows and then it opens up this note and I can immediately start editing this is quick I could make maybe just make a quick change pick um make change that you know whatever it is and then I can go ahead hover away and it closes extremely powerful I would not be surprised if obsidian ends up adopting this this feature as well to their page preview 93 the core plugin tags so just like files over here just so you're aware this tab is considered a plug-in and it's really nice to just know like these things they aren't always there somebody a developer has to say well how do what do we need what do we need well we need a search don't we we need a way to look at files or notes right do we need tags so those are all questions that come up and it might seem simple but it's nice to look at it through a new lens and say well okay I get it now that I I get why it's its own thing okay next one at 92 we have call outs I was a late adopter for call outs I was skeptical of call outs mainly because they add a little bit of visual clutter when you are working in that Source mode however when you're in live preview they're just beautiful so let's open up call outs let's close this side tab and something for people who have obsidian flight school 2.0 and Beyond we have custom call outs so all these cool looking things these are custom call outs I'll show you a few more uses of them and if I go to settings and I go to appearances and I scroll down a bit these are CSS Snippets this is a little bit more advanced but um these are all included in in flight school and they're just really nice to use so let me just jump around a little bit so you can see how they are being used so obsidian functions you can see immediately is part of the instrument's wing now if I were to go to plugins this stays so I'm using a call out to be what to be my visual consistent wayfinding apparatus my way finding sign all right so display functions graph it's all here instruments Wing I just think that's phenomenal now I can go to the top link that's going to take me back to the hanger eventually and where was that it was in the instruments wing so that makes sense right well let's check out this blue one the piloting Wing So now if I go into the obsidian interface you can see that we have another consistent reliable visual breadcrumb here I'm currently in obsidian interface but I could just as easily go into text work and notice that this stays exactly the same we don't recognize how important wayfinding like this is until it's not around and to solve this problem it was really nice really effective to to be able to use callouts so you can see navigation keyboard combos slightly different in this one really effective and then you can look in basic training we have our formatting section basic training so no rocket a bicycle this time settings themes and my favorite note of them all core maneuvers core Maneuvers oh my goodness this is my favorite is the basics but what if you could be this this much better at how you create open and Link notes you do that move how many times if you're working with linked based knowledge you do it all the time what if you could do it better you get closer to thinking at the speed of thought so that's why this is so important but let's take it back to call outs so one thing I want to point your attention to is how does this look let's even go into the edit mode here and what I want to do is point your attention to bike so this is a custom call out and what you'll notice here is that you'll see bike now when you're using callouts in general you can just go to bike and let's change it to map which is another custom call out of mine and you can see it's changed to map over here so it doesn't hurt to get the wraps once you've done it a few times it comes very natural and what's really important about call outs is that you have it hotkeyed to something so let's let's look at a great place where we could do a call out how about okay check this out see this paragraph here I'm going to select it and I'm going to hit my insert call out hotkey so boom now it's a call out and there it is it's that simple Now call outs are not that simple if you don't have it hotkeyed or if you don't use the command palette you could also hit command P remember the command palette it's a 100 for a reason I hit command P I think to my what am I trying to oh yeah call out there it is I go ahead and hit enter and now we have it pretty cool very cool so call outs are amazing I must say I am pleasantly pleasantly surprised by callouts this is another function it's not a plug-in it's a function moving on I'll just cover this one fast I might speed up even more I said I was going to speed up I don't think I did file recovery very important it's extremely important that you can recover your files so we can go to file recovery we can start to jump into this stuff if we've lost a file very important next one hotkeys plus plus this is one of those small quality of life improvements that I think came in 2020 and when it did I've loved it ever since so thank you and I believe Argentina thank you because what's so nice about this is if I'm on this line I'm just going to hit the hotkey and see what happens over here on the left it goes from a dash to a number to nothing back to a dash which is a bullet so this is really effective for changing notes quickly I mean I could do it to multiple notes now we have that and it's nothing and if you think oh wait that's weird why are there two ones there are a couple ways to fix that one but if you look into your reading view you can say see that it's perfectly fine um okay extra credit if you really want to know you just backspace the first one and then it would change all the way actually I can't help myself so I'm going to show you a little bit more and let's imagine I'm going to hit hotkeys plus plus command excuse me wrong one and then we're going to switch you can see they're all ones so here's what I mean all you have to do is take this one now I'm going to hit enter there you go so that's how you might do that change let me just undo a few until we're back to where we want to be and that's quality of life Improvement text format I'm not going to go into too much other than to say it can do some things really fantastically really fast so if there are blank lines you can quickly remove them if I want to make this all uppercase I can select this then I won't remember the hockey but I'll remember uppercase so I hit command palette and then boom it's all uppercase pretty amazing moving on workspaces Plus so a core feature of obsidian is workspaces you can see I've given it a 90. but I've given the community plugin workspaces plus a 92 because it allows me to easily tweak and update of workspaces in this case you can find workspaces down here I have a hotkey let me hit that hotkey now I'm going to open up the map view so see these four main Maps we now have these four main Maps is it how cool is that now if we go to open basic training we have the basic training notes open right away how cool is that what about the piloting wing and it goes on I just I'm blown away and it's beautiful with these call outs can you see how everything's working together to give such a fantastic experience so let's close all the other tabs and then let's open up top 44 hit enter and we're back next up we have paste URL into selection I will skip this one but it allows you it's a quality of life Improvement where you can copy a URL and then just select some text and then hit paste in a special way and this will become this word will become a linked a linked word to the URL okay and then workspace is a is at 90 and how can we not cover the graph views so we have let's check out the graph view how does it look in flight school I'm curious it's been a while all right so what you'll notice here is this is plugins the plugins are pink we have my main three Notes The Hanger the checklist and the map in yellow where are these green ones oh the commands or the hotkeys if you will what about these orange ones aha oh these are the commands excellent I see what's happening here oh the the main main Wing the notes that have for each Wing there are some main notes and so that's where I gave some of these ones okay gotcha so you can start to see how everything's pieced together and this is Flight School whenever I look at this I think of the uh trying to count those M M's in in the jar the glass jar and everyone doesn't recognize how many M M's are actually in the jar in case you were wondering there are 307 notes in obsidian Flight School and 365 files as of this recording it definitely goes up we were at 53 000 words I did some cuts to get down to 48 000 however that is still more than the Great Gatsby so that's interesting let's go back to the top 44. and let's look into the local graph in fact now there's a hotkey for me to pull up the local graph which I just hit and it's important to know when you initially pull up the open graph the local graph it will open up in a different tab group over here now just remember you can move around tabs wherever you want to so what I did long ago is I took this local graph and I threw it over here so now we have the same local graph twice one zoomed in the other is not let me just get rid of one and now we're back to The Way We Were that takes us through let me zoom out that takes us through the first I believe around 27 of my top 44 obsidian plugins and functions all ranked oh my goodness can you believe that I'm still going I can't I have not taken one sip of water because I wanted to keep up a fast pace to get you the most meat per minute and if we were to continue this is the final this is the final part of the list I'm not going to go through each one I'm just going to talk about the one-liners Wikipedia a simple plugin this person also took the link in your thinking Workshop thank you Jonathan what's so amazing about this is that it allows you to quickly put in little bits of Wikipedia into a note I won't get into the details sortable this will probably go away once Michael Brandon comes out with data core but it allows you to quickly sort data view tables word count this is a core plugin and as you can see over here it allows you to have word counts pretty awesome better word count at 85 gives you a little bit more and allows you to oh I got them backwards this is the core word count and this is better word count how do I know the reason I have better word count is so when I highlight things notice what's happening down here it's updating I use this a lot I think anyone who's writing or even if you don't consider yourself a writer when you are writing and you want to stay within certain lengths it's very important to know how long you go random note see this dice over here we can start opening random notes dare me to do it now I will I'll do it all right workspaces projects my top three plugins each go into something else let's see what else recent files delete current file plug-in file recovery I'll remember this daily note that we made let me go ahead and delete that because we don't need that anymore my Snippets this is another one let's get something more exciting all right we've got some queries that's at least a little bit more exciting file recovery ah here we go opening a note so now you can see a little bit more of the action in some of these notes should I roll the dice I did this is one of my more favorite ones recently is how you can quickly manipulate tabs within obsidian and then we talk about each of these as a command each command oftentimes has a video we talk about if it's a universal hotkey or if it's not how you can use these all in sequence and it's very important that you can manipulate and I mean that in a non-person to person sense but as in using your digits your hands to manipulate things like someone would manipulate clay right so that's what we mean here and the better you can do that like an ace pilot the faster that you can think the closer you can get to the speed of thought okay cool so with that in mind let's go back to top 44 and let's finish this out publish allows you to it's a core feature allowing you to publish your notes online and you might be thinking if you are paying close attention well you skipped outline Nick let's cover outline so what's really cool about outline is it is another plugin that you can throw in the side Tab and let's go to a note that actually takes advantage of this let's go back to the hanger okay oh actually the hanger let's go back to flight school arrival so this is a header two and this is a header two now I don't do this a lot but I'm pretty sure we can swap these two around this was a feature that cgp gray The prominent YouTuber was really pining for and it finally was delivered to obsidian's core user feature set about one year ago the beginning of 2022 and so now I can take this and just shift it above did you see that did you just see what I did that is insane you can just flop those things around so fast so I don't use that nearly enough for how cool it is so now let's take it back um that was outlined random note we can publish our notes online you may have stumbled across my um light kit the link in your thinking clip kit has now been downloaded 72 000 time okay it's uh pretty amazing so there's an online version where you can see what it looks like to publish your notes pain relief parts of it are deprecated but I still use swap tab left and swap tab right quite a bit and what this allows me to do is see this tab here I'm going to just with the keyboard put it over here so here we go and there it goes pretty nice when you combine that with switching tabs well you can switch tabs and then you can quickly move tabs now if you toggle stack tabs you can also click and drag so you don't have to necessarily be an expert Keyboard Ninja for tab management it just makes you even faster so you can always just use the mouse okay so let's go over here close everything else and we can have some quality of life improvements I'll skip through these they're in obsidian Flight School recent files I did end up showing no no I don't currently have recent files turned on note tweet sometimes I don't want to go on Twitter but I just have a cool idea and I think I'll just share it and I can use note tweet to make sure it goes there I don't even have to look to see who responds or anything it's just it's there no distraction it's great prompt is from hongsu hongsu also took the linking or thinking workshop and created a simple but really powerful thought-prompting mechanism and this would not be complete without covering iframes now when you look at any of the videos in obsidian flight school for example this arrival video right here what is this so let's jump into it and there's a wild looking iframe this is embedded from some URL out there and that's what we're looking at right here so that's how iframes work you can embed websites very powerful read wise official this is a great way to manage your highlights many people out here are read wise or reader users read wise that company they're fantastic they're phenomenal they make great products and they really really care so for those who have a heavy highlighting collecting workflow and they want to get all those highlights into their system it just you kind of have to mention read wise because they're at the top of the class for that and then I'll finish with one that I already talked about which was Excalibur allowing you another way to do visual sketching I must admit I'll normally go into canvas these days but you could tell like you know canvas can't do sketches like mock-ups like this that's not what its intent is so Excalibur in canvas can work in harmony quite well to fulfill your visual spatial thinking needs folks we did it I don't know how long this went I truly hope that I hit the record button that my audio has successfully recorded because I am not doing this one again if you enjoyed this give this video a like a couple extra things before before you go by the way but if you enjoyed this give it a like give it a comment and in the comments below tell me which plugin are you most excited about looking at more deeply are some of these core plugins things that have been right under your nose and you never even recognized how powerful they are how would you rank some of these are there places where you think I'm way off now before you go there are a couple other things I want to draw to your attention and I've kind of mentioned it a million times already but I'm just too proud not to mention it again too proud of what has been put up pulled off here so this whole thing that we're looking at it's 365 notes all linked together and it is intended to do one thing help you become faster in obsidian if you're looking to get faster in obsidian check out obsidian flight school in the description below this is version 2.0 I can't tell you how many countless hours go into making sure each note is updated the obsidian Developers they work too fast they work too fast and and things get out of you know things are improved we have tabs all this thing all these things that make us so excited but when it comes to keeping obsidian flight school up to date well that was difficult this past year we had our little patches but this is a big time release now I'll tell you this too you don't have to worry about having to repurchase flight school people are blown away all you know all thousand plus I won't get to the exact number that purchased 1.0 they receive this update 2.0 for free and anyone who purchases any version of flight school they get the updates for free that's the importance of just getting you into flight school now get better at obsidian can you imagine where you would be if you could think closer to the speed of thoughts but do that externally in a way that you can say that is saved for you that you can then connect and grow thoughts over time that is the Hope with obsidian flight school that you can effectively pilot and fly around your thoughts faster than ever before I really hope you enjoyed your top the top 44. I'm really curious you better comment below let me know I want to engage with you in the comments really finding out what did I miss what do you think should have been on this list now I could only choose 44. I had over 800 probably 850 options to choose from these are my top 44. I'm curious what some of your top ones are thank you so much for your time I look forward to seeing you next time and until then stay connected [Music] [Music]
