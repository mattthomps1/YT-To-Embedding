if you are wondering how to take the things you encounter and turn them into a captivating unique and finalized product you'll get quite a bit out of this live note making session with eleanor koenig eleanor studied ancient philosophy and religion before graduating law school and through it all she keeps asking why and writing every step of the way she's also a natural teacher who kept me on my toes throughout the session trying to answer what a tribute is what economy is and why it all matters in the following eleanor takes us on a note making journey into how she researches generates questions makes connections and creates products that she gets paid for we'll see how she uses the powerful dataview plugin and will leave with the creative process that works for writers of fiction non-fiction articles and everything in between let's view eleanor's inspiring process now the reason we wanted to do this is because you had a really cool post on obsidian on the forums and it kind of took off and among other things you've been so active on those forums talking about your process for putting together articles and building worlds writing characters all these different things and and the people want to see it the people want answers so we just put this together really quickly yeah i think um you know in sort of knowledge management there's there's different stages there's the well how do i collect all of the things that i found and make sure that i don't lose them because they're so important to me and then there's the how do i learn from it and process information and do something with it and then there's that like other part that not everybody does not everybody needs to do where you want to turn that into a product whether it's a you know an academic paper or a blog post or a letter to your mother which sometimes i do um a newsletter whatever whatever sort of product you want to do the whole point of the settle cost and method and i may be mispronouncing that but the whole point of that method was that the the guy who came up with it was incredibly prolific as a producer like he wasn't just sort of sitting off in the corner keeping track of stuff for his own like you know personal little gollum style miser my precious like he wanted to share his thoughts with the world and the subtle costume method is about keeping your thoughts so that they can be moved around and manipulated and turned into something and i'm in a position where i have been blogging for years and writing articles and i like to think they're pretty interesting and apparently other people agree so the the steps of capture to processing to article and obsidian which is the software that i use um i think that that process and those steps is something that people like to see because it can be hard to juggle a big process in your head like that and see how it all plays together and get ideas from other people like i've been hanging out in the obsidian community for a couple of months now and the way that i write articles has changed completely like i i have become like four times as prolific as i was i actually um i have like i'm in a position now where i'm sort of getting picked up for freelance gigs that i can't quite talk about yet but they're very exciting and i'm like i'm a staff writer now for for um world building magazine and like sitting in the subtle custom process and linking your thinking and all of the you know all of the resources that you and the others have put together have just been incredibly helpful i actually spent some time this morning turning a big encyclopedia style note that i thought was how i wanted my information organized into atomic notes because i was like no actually this is this is way too much to process so like i'm you're convincing me you're bringing me over to your way of thinking and it's working um so i guess i guess let's get started on how i process information and turn it into articles wonderful i just have to say how excited i am i'm just really excited to your point that there are so many ways to use links and you can track information like you can track what you ate the meetings you had the coffee you drank i am less interested in that and i'm much more interested in creative uses or academic uses or how those converge together and so getting insight into your process here is is just i'm excited yeah it's great and to be fair i also track stuff like how much i exercised and what i'm happy about so like i do it all but in this particular in this particular sort of video let's focus on on the flow so this is this is a book this is an academic textbook that i got for christmas because i'm a nerd and a friend got it for me it's beyond the blue horizon how the earliest mariners unlocked the secrets of the sea which you can't see but so i i start with a book i enjoy reading academic texts i think that's fun i check out books from interlibrary loan that get shipped from like the fort meade library and the you know the army and i i like i like some pretty nerdy stuff and now that i've finished my master's degree i don't have access to the university library anymore so i have to find things other ways um i i do this process with paper physical books a lot i do with pdfs but for the purposes of showing you it's easier if it's on the computer but obsidian mobile plus read wise man lets you go from a paper book to screenshots and voice chat for your notes in a very seamless way so i highly recommend that when that drops out of beta but so anyway so i'll start i'll start with a book this is a book this is a page i haven't read and i i read and i'm i'm reading looking for information that's relevant to me the hardest part i think of note taking is is what to take notes on right like when you're reading a textbook or you're reading a book or you're reading a newspaper article or by students or reading their textbook or a paper that i gave them the instinct is to highlight all the stuff because it's interesting it's useful or it wouldn't be in the book and the important thing is to know what you're trying to do with it right if you're just capturing everything that's interesting you will never do anything in your life but capture information that like that's a choice you can do that people people find joy in that i'm not telling people how to live their life but i personally like to have a product so as i'm reading i'm thinking of my purpose in mind and the thing that i like to write about and talk about and feel qualified to do anything with is history infrastructure the insights that i have about why things in society became the way they are i look for for wisdom from the ancients i look for how i can take inspiration from history to write a book that hasn't been talked about before i'm looking for new stuff new insights that don't exist in other places so as i'm reading i'm looking about i'm looking here and there's islam in 1436 more and more the south china sea and the indian ocean trade pass through this port and i don't care because as important as dates are and times are and places are and conversions are and people are when you're taking a memorization test in college which seriously important not trying to say it's not important but that's not what i'm here for so i have to shut all of those like school instincts out of my mind and stop caring about 1436 and the peninsula and start looking for patterns pattern of trade flourished until the portuguese that reminds me of some stuff i've read before but it's really not that interesting but lamu i've taught about this is some nice stuff about the phoenicians and the indians but it's just not important right like it's interesting but it's not why i'm here i'm here to learn something interesting not just learn something so i read and here we go the north atlantic was the most formidable of all seascapes for mariners to decode as were the english and the irish seas the north sea and the baltic i didn't know that did you know that did you know that like the english seas were harder to navigate than any other part of the world i had no clue do you know why i know that the atlantic uh currents move northward and bring warm water other than that i have no clue well apparently there were no predictable shifts to allow an explorer safe passage home from an outward journey as opposed to the monsoon winds in india so in india into like the swahili coast the winds blow this way and then they blow this way and then they blow this way and then they blow this way depending on the season in england that's not the case there are huge storms pitiless rocks strong tides and onshore winds made piloted close to land a risky venture even in calm southern weather so i'm gonna highlight this but i'm also going to highlight the other part if it lets me which it's not because you know why would kindle ever contribute to something that i want to accomplish so the reason that i'm highlighting this is because one i can use this can you see this great note in the screen sharing by the way okay i'm just never sure how much to trust zoom so i can use this to create conflict in a story when you're writing a story you want something that's difficult right like you don't want it to be easy for the characters so this is a challenging environment for seafarers challenge so this i could use this information great storms pitiless rocks strong tides onshore winds this is the conditions to make things hard for a sailor so later if i'm creating a linked list create a map of content look at it eunic create a map of context actually i made a tag for this add moc for difficult sailing conditions so i know that i've come across a couple of other things that make sailing hard right somewhere in these notes in this book probably exists some information for that and i've come across enough things in this book that i'm pretty sure i can make a list of things that make sailing difficult right like i can have an atomic note for that that's the whole point that's why we're here we're looking for things we can take notes on that matter that give us something to talk about so rather than make you sit here while i read through the entire book which i did not mean to do whatever i just did i'm going to export all of my highlights yeah that's amazing this nifty read-wise tool so i have to do that the hard way because it's actually really annoying to get to highlights from from the kindle right yeah yeah it's like fine it's weirdly difficult so you can copy it to your clipboard if you have flashbar installed and i'm not doing that but i can download it as a text file and since i use obsidian and everything's in a markdown file they're basically the same thing so i'm going to stop sharing this screen and find that file move it over nip city and then share that screen because i don't know how to share just a window there we go so you should be able to see my screen and i store all of my um all of my like literature notes in a folder and i know that people have opinions about folders and i don't want to call it one of the personal acknowledgement management like holy wars because i think it's more like a perpetual agree to disagree but um i am personally a folder user i i just find it easier i do enough with things that are other programs like concatenating all of my files and you know exporting things in different formats and using pandoc and like i i do too much to not have folders um there are reasons to do it either way everybody's different yeah i agree with you and just to that point the landscape it's the the the sand beneath our feet is currently shifting and so the reason for not using folders with the whole settle costin uh boom from a few years back kind of moving into right now it made the lack of folders like it made links the the first class citizen and what a lot of people did they threw the baby out with the bathwater and said well that means folders are the bad guys the the bad people no more folders and it's it's like well no actually they actually can still serve their their intended purpose which is to kind of wall off content from other content except you can still access it globally with you know searches and links just and that's sort of how we have to shift our paradigm with how folders can be used along with links in a healthy system and along with tags and whatever anyways yeah yeah absolutely it's just it depends on what you're doing if all you have is atomic notes you don't need folders if you have atomic notes and also your articles and also your daily notes and also your pdfs and also like want to easily like separate out between different things folders are amazing folders are fantastic folders are life that's my physician aloha anyway so i wind up with this handy dandy data dump really it's it's almost useless in this form um but you can see that i have been going through that book for a while i've actually been reading it on my phone when i'm out and about and it's stuff i haven't seen in a while right like i've been reading this lengthy textbook for frankly since december it's march you've been reading for the last three months that's a long time to read a book you're going to forget stuff which is why the repetition of going back and reviewing your information is really important for pruning out things you don't need anymore making sure the idea makes sense et cetera and this early stuff is actually before i realized that i could add an invitations in kindle annotations and kindle are amazing and these notes you can see this is what i added so what i like to do is i add headings i know that people have opinions about block quotes versus headings or not block what's black references versus headings like i i i find obsidian to be a very heading-centric tool and i think it's incredibly useful to give descriptive heading names to things so i'm going to label it location250 because that's the location this was at because i really like number names i know that not everybody does but i i pre-penned with the location so that i can very easily type in words to the search when i'm using um this feature and i don't get every instance of cow so like it's a unique identifier basically um so this quote is about tribute tribute had arrived sporadically from countries on zhang he's regular itinerary since the blah blah blah blah display of overwhelming military power tributary relationship so this looks like i was interested in the tribute economy of china you can see in the annotations as i was annotating i literally already had my links like i know that china was a page even when i'm out you know getting ready to go to a doctor's appointment on my phone i know that i have a page about china so i don't have to do that now because i already did that and i this backwards mapping function is a dump file that i use just for collecting backlinks that's not what i wanted that was not hockey i thought it was um so this is just a place where i dump ideas i just like sometimes i have an idea of wait that thing that i just read reminds me of a book i read once so i collect all of those and eventually i'm going to turn it into a long blog post on here's a book and here's a connection it has to a real-life concept here's a fiction book here's a real life concept whether that's the um vegeta the vegetarian spiders in adrian chiakovsky's book like i i found out the vegetarian spiders were real that isn't that cool like vegetarian spiders there's one species of spider that eats trees i had no idea i'm going to use that because it's fascinating or like lee madison has a book about um where there are door keys and until i was studying rome i had no idea that there were like two or three governments in history that had co-rulers like co-rulers that's that's a thing apparently it is so i have this whole other like article i'm working on about co-rulers point being i'm a big fan of these backlink dump file things because then i don't have to go update like the file right like i don't have to open the file and type into it i've i stay in the same file i'm a big fan of working from the same file and so that backlinks mapping that's a catch-all so it might it might have a 50 it might have 100 backlinks and then and then you can go to that when you're feeling creative and connected and then you can connect it to where you need to is that exactly and once i've used it and i'm done with it and like i've i've gotten everything out of it i've i use it almost like a to-do list i then delete the backlink and it's not there anymore then i make it a forward link of i use this for you know sure thing yeah the back legs are key so i have this note to myself about add moc to economics i wanted to add this thing about the tribute economy to my economic spot file i have this lovely list of things related to economics that i made when all of my stuff about economics got too unwieldy i make it a point to only make these kinds of files when the other stuff is unwieldy like if i start forgetting all of the times i've talked about something then i make an index file i don't just make an index file because i have two things on topic that's what that's what synthesis is for indexes are for when you get overwhelmed really any change to your system is for when you get overwhelmed don't make work just for the sake of making work people do that and i don't get it um so i had this thought as i was reading this section that tribute economy in china was what was it doing was sporadic was sporadic in the era of and i'm actually including his name because he's a super important guy basically because of this so i have this other note here about the youngly emperor organizing expeditions why was he doing that i don't remember let's find out big chunks okay this one was interesting because the number of people commodities you know what i'm just gonna search for tribute which is apparently a subword of other words which i did not realize so i've got a weirdly large amount of information about tribute i don't want to limit myself to just china i want to talk about tribute economies i didn't realize i had so much information about tribute economies and now i'm like curious right so tribute economies boom time to make a list tribute economies are an alternative to money incidentally i just learned that trick today did you see that i just dragged and dropped that link it's pretty amazing i don't know what else i got that's amazing okay so we've got this let's see l2509 why didn't that work oh cause ha i hit enter by accident there we go so we've got this about tribute economies what because i don't do the drag and drop that much when you drag it in even if if it's a highlighted spot you still have to then specify it in the note if you if it's if it's the um the what's the word if i specifically want the heading yeah there's actually a feature request for it not to be that on the forum okay so give it a week yeah so apparently there is a some people used marriages tribute that's interesting i forgot that i can just do this seriously the features are amazing so agricultural tribute is a thing interesting what is tribute what do you think it means it's a a gift of showing um fealty or res uh respect yeah i don't know yeah like what does it mean so when you're you're you're a king right and you want tribute people just give you stuff why what do you do to earn tribute uh well you should provide protection or you're you're at least giving fear okay so a combination of those among others why right like why here's my question why i would someone pay tribute to an emperor let's brainstorm fear to get something from the emperor are there other reasons like agreement like maybe it's a contractual like a treaty like treaty peace agreement i mean that's really something from the really it's all to get something from the emperor right if it's your fear you don't want them to attack yeah and in that same sub-header would be protection so not just them attacking but outside invaders forces people so like what is tribute 4 see if i have anything else about this brotherhood of kings foreign powers tribute all right let's see what we got yeah hold on just a second you did this before i want to see what happened there so the tribute that you just typed um can you show that again how you did the yeah so i i just dragged over and then i hit the uh the carrot and then i just typed tribute okay to search because you know that's it's on the in that block okay gotcha yeah and then you can see it pops up with the bold and then there's actually other uses but that's contributed which isn't as useful and then there's actually this one that i had missed that's only the see the thing is um it doesn't there's a bug that i reported today where you have to you have to use the keyboard you can't use the mouse clicking it doesn't make it complete interest okay so that's maybe okay gotcha so yeah i did the same thing here where i clicked it it's so my instinct to click it you have to actually use the okay yeah i saw that and i was like what am i not knowing yeah so so now i have these things and i'm gonna just straight like use it as a workbench click click click i know sliding panes is better i just don't like them okay so tribute you know what this is slime specifically zoom islamic it's not letting me get to the thing all right so alternatives to money these are different kinds of economies really because everybody's like whole we could trade you one gold coin in a video game right like it's always here's a gold coin the only game i've ever played where they don't use some here's a silver coin here's the gold coin here's a dollar here's a credit right like they're all currency currency is boring why is it always currency we're like in the disc in the in the discord for obsidian in this community no one is paying dollars in exchange for things we are we are paying it forward we are we are a community who who pays back by giving our time right like people help me solve my problems because i help other people solve their problems like we're a community we don't need dollars you don't have to pay me seven dollars because i made a plug-in and then i pay somebody else six dollars to fix a bug like that's not the economy that obsidian runs on it runs on decency and connections and like how we help each other so it doesn't have to be dollars what are the other kinds of economies well there's the if you give me thing i want i will protect you there's you know i will send out a whole bunch of stuff to you if you then have a reason to send me stuff i will send you stuff because when you send me stuff it makes me look good in front of all of the other you know important people in my community when people do stuff for me that makes me have more prestige there's that kind of economy the prestige economy there's this really horrifying economy of who is allowed to marry whose daughters that was a thing in the levant in the like bronze age i see your face it's a thing it's a total thing it's actually like not as bad as i'm making it sound but um the the economy of who is married to who the economy of who is your family like i say economy like it's a bad thing but you help people who are connected to you and what what is an economy except for a way to regulate who owes who what really that's what an economy is right like what's what it's supposed to be i'm not arguing yeah so like you know in a way family connections are a sort of like economy is the wrong word but it's it's that same thing of who owes who what like who owes who respect in a family who what yeah so does it have to be my mother my mother gave me fifty dollars to fix her computer and i gave my mother fifty dollars because no no like i i fixed my mom's computer right like my mom didn't pay me to fix her computer i helped my mom mm-hmm in a complex society money is how you you say i earned help right like i earned help eating give me food so i can eat i am helping you with you know your computer problem give me dollars so that i can exchange it for someone else to help me like money and economies make things fluid fluid yeah they make things they make things work in a complex society does that mean that not there that there's not an economy in a small no the econo the currency is is help right like the currency of obsidian is of the sitting community is in some ways your contributions which are how you help people and the more you help people the more likely you are to get helped and everybody starts out with a certain amount of like you know everybody starts out with a metaphorical like you know everybody joins with 50 metaphorical dollars that you can spend getting help but after a certain point if you only asked questions and they were really hard questions people would like you know eventually stop helping you mm-hmm i've never seen that happen but i have to assume that that would be what happens right like you ask a whole bunch of annoying questions and you don't help anybody back you try their coaches yeah like there's a currency there and the currency is like human decency and we don't think about it but economies are complicated and this this is how i make mmc's normally i would have dictated that into a phone i'm gonna run a voice record thing about this later but like that's that's how you go from you know i was reading a thing in a note to the fundamental nature of economies what is an economy what is a tribute economy it's all of this stuff and now i have a map of content wow well that's pretty great yeah is eleanor quizzing me or does she know the answer does she know where she wants to go but you're forming this as you're going yeah yeah that's how i think i mean that's the beauty of putting together a workbench type of map of content where you can throw these things in here and have these ideas start to to battle each other to to kind of interact exchange information wow that's really great so can communities have their own currency favors help etc so this is going to become an article seed right and then i'm going to add this to my economics note about tribute economies okay so you've connected so you've connected what you just did there and before you lose it before you go on your way you you decide you know i have this ex pre-existing web of of knowledge and let me kind of like tether it to those to those areas so that if i'm if you're in the um article writing state trying to choose an article you can find it there you can find it directly if you knew exactly to search for tribute economies or you can find it more broadly just by searching economies and then seeing it in this list so you're giving yourselves avenue several avenues of rediscovery of re-retrieval is that accurate absolutely like i want to be able to find that again and i'm not gonna just like sit down be like oh yeah i i had that on my to-do list my to-do list is enormous like i function by not putting things like that on my to-do list if i put every idea i had for an article on a to-do list i would only ever make to-do lists that's well said yeah i haven't heard that before but but you know now i have a note that i will totally be able to find again if i'm ever looking for article and blog ideas i have i use dataview to uh help myself with that so i have an index that i don't have to manually update because as much as you know maps of context indexes are interesting and useful i don't enjoy manually updating them so i use the new dataview plugin and it just pulls every single article that i have filed as a article what it's for where i'm gonna put it for i write for a couple of different outlets or you know aspire to write for a couple of different outlets but i also use the backlinks pane um we probably should dig in a little bit to data view sure data is great yeah i am curious to see how that's being used i know it's powerful that's all i know fair i i like i only just started using it i actually i had to get help today but uh you know you do your part for the community and the community helps you that's right that's the economy yes it really is so this is how dataview works let's just make that go away for now you have a bunch of yaml metadata at the top you you set this however you want it so i personally chose to differentiate between articles blog posts and some other thing i don't even remember what it was and then the reason i do that is because for world building magazine i write blog posts and articles and they're like a totally different format mostly i write articles that are actually blog posts but in that particular niche thing i they're different so okay make this however you want it to be and then i you said you you you say that you do differentiate them but if i'm looking at our utopia is always boring i see type article so i'm curious where where is dataview pulling from the other types or how does it oh um okay so literally i am i created it so where did you see that maybe just keep going um i'm starting to interrupt if you keep going it'll answer itself so i i basically i created this this is this is metadata that i added okay article what it's for where it's at in terms of and then i i personally input a like when i last updated the status which for this one was today for most of these it was today um but so for example in the published ones i didn't do this for all of them so bear with me but this one i already published this on my website so i i publish it on this date it's ek is the market it's my personal website um and it's an article and then you can see i have these like hidden sort of things it was related to because it's an article but i still want the backlinks that's what comments are for i was so happy the day that we got comments i know that i i really really really need this ability um so yeah so i i i make this i decided this was the information i wanted to have access to there are other things that you can do with it okay so um you so you put that in each note and then you can then you can do something like uh data view yes and basically you're pulling all that information so could could you go back to that one um this i'm just a couple steps slow on this but if you go back to the note article no no it's just because i haven't used it before article and blog idea that one and for people interested yes so what we're seeing here is one of these block queries block embed queries what's this called where you have the data view index and article and block literally it's a block it's i don't know it's a query i don't know i don't know what they called it i just know how to do it it's the back tick back tick back tick thing exactly it's the like three back tricks i'm sure it has a name and then let's just uh really quickly table file size market so what what how did you input this stuff is this because that's that's where the magic's happening so okay so dataview is this line is is telling obsidian um that this is a code block this is what the backtakes means the backtick means it's the code block dataview is this is code that we actually want you to do something with right so there are a couple of other things i think you can do a query block too i haven't messed with those but they exist so there's a couple of different ways that you can interact with obsidian with these like block things table is me telling dataview that i wanted to output in a table not a list you have choices like um i can show you a list later so like you can see how this is a table it has three columns and 110 billion rows so then the the headings that i want are file size and market and it it knows that i want the name i don't there might be a way to have it not give the name but i don't that's that's like some advanced stuff there and then i'm telling it where i want to want it to pull the files from i'm pulling from this particular folder and this is where folders shine folders there you have it this is where folders shine because um dataview may actually let you do the like multiple tags but i i don't know how and i couldn't figure it out and i wanted it but it didn't work so like if i'm looking for something that is uh that will go to both my website or world building magazine if world building mag doesn't mag doesn't want it i'll put it on my website like that would be suitable for two places i haven't figured out how to do that it might be possible i don't want to make it sound like the the plugin can't but i couldn't figure it out so um it really helps like limit and give you another thing to search from so you can search from a tag and a file path probably but i don't i don't know how um anyway so this is like a if then kind of thing so i'm looking for files that are inside of this folder that have current status set as seed so it will not show this file because this is not a seed this is a published article okay and then it gives me the list in order of file size like the bigger file sizes at the top because i usually want the like most finished thing to work on next or like most of the time if i'm like oh crap i need an article i have a deadline i don't want the thing that hasn't had more than like six words on it like at all i don't want that article yeah not that one i want to work on that article which is actually a conversation that i have a killer on the discord but i'm eventually going to turn that into a like real thought process because it was a good conversation and i said things i think were smart yeah i get a lot of articles from various discords i'm not gonna lie because you know okay well okay so talk about stuff sorry what oh yeah no yeah no no well to your point um absolutely it's what we're we're entering the forum if you will agora might be another term for it but yeah we enter into this place where we can uh you know have these it's a sharpening stone and we just all of a sudden say something and i'm thinking oh i better record that for myself because i think it's it's worth saving you know um so absolutely i feel that uh thank you for showing the data view aspect that was a little bit of a detour i didn't mean to take you down like all the way into this but i do think it's important for people to see how powerful it is to manage um article and blog ideas like you're doing i'm i'm gonna go okay so like my plan is i'm gonna go back and add this yaml thing to all of my um all of my like i'm gonna make a template for all of my atomic notes so that i can automatically add it to relevant maps of content so that's i'm really liking this um the big question then becomes though um ultimately what are the yaml categories that that they'll be we'll kind of like settle on as being you know some of the main conventions i know everyone will be different and unique however if you had to speculate for what you're about to do with auto updating mlcs that way what would you put would you stick with these four type market current status status updated i wouldn't so this is specifically because i'm working with articles right sure so i'm definitely going to keep this for the articles and and this stuff but what i want to do is i want to make it easier to not necessarily rely on the backlinks pane as a to-do list like the backlinks pain will always be great but i want it to be like a sort of a the same concept except specific things that i put there on purpose like so when i'm when i'm sitting there going oh this would be great as an economics thing i want to make those synthesis notes link into maps of content i already have so what i'll do is i'll do like here you know what let's experiment let's see what happens sure let's go for it bear with me if this is slow uh wasn't planning to do this but you know what plans to shaw that's right all right so somewhere in here i had a story about how i was gonna process this note and boy howdy are you watching me process this note right all right east africa's valuable commodities have traveled as far as china as early as the 10th century china was one of two great economic powerhouses the other being this caliphate caliphate caliphate i knew that okay so this is a note that i kept because i cared about who china treated with in the 10th century but i also care about africa oops that was a speedo just worth noting the prompt that you're saying to yourself out loud this isn't you know where i cared about and that helps you figure out what to title it oh yeah i if i don't care about it i just delete it that's great so all right so i i do care about who china traded with i also care about um how do i phrase this i'm interested in how the economy of the monsoon world worked so you know what let's do that let's do the monsoon world what is the monsoon world if you had to guess based on only things i've taught you in the last 20 minutes based on what you've taught me uh the monsoon world is indian ocean and it has to do with the seasonality of the currents and how that affected trade between africa to you know india into china that would be my guess it's a good guess based on the monsoon winds allowing trade between china the swahili coast and i'm not making a link for this because i know that page doesn't exist and if i wind up doing something weird like this while swahili coasts or swahili coast people or just swahili i don't want to mess up my links i want to go into the backlink pane i keep pointing at my screen like you can see me i want to go in the backlink pane and click them and have them automatically do it based on the aliases that's why i i avoid um links to uncreated pages like it's my job i know other people have a different method but that is my method that i haven't seen a lot of people talk about so i'm going to mention it because they don't it's not like wikipedia or media wiki where you can do a redirect you can't redirect an obsidian have to make it right the first time talk with my hands so it was between the spili coast and india now i i know i have a note about the harappan civilization because i usually don't care about india per se so i am going to say harappan parapan i actually don't know i'm a bad person i should learn that so there you go in this valley civilization and like if i were wikipedia this article would actually be india and it would like separate out between the indian subcontinent and the robin civilization like i i don't i care about the bronze age i i care about ancient infrastructure i care about really old trade i don't like i mean i care about the people of india but like for the purposes of my knowledge vault i'm not trying to learn everything you can't learn everything it's not possible it isn't and you bring up a good point it's like this that's why it's the personal knowledge management system and i think you know there's there's some sort of slippery slope maybe it's i don't want to mislabel things but it kind of seems to be when our ocd tendencies get the better of us and because it's called india then somebody out there including myself sometimes thinks well i need to create an india note i need to create the subcontinent and do all those things you just talked about and then you know an hour later i'm like why did i spend all this energy and time doing this when it's not related to anything else that i'm currently interested in and the reason is because you just did it but you shouldn't have because you're not doing anything with it so i think i think it's really important what you just said and i hope i just want to pull that out as well make a mini meal out of that one i have more notes about the swahili factor than i thought i did this is the discovery process right like yeah exactly so you're doing research search yeah so i i was i knew there was one thing about swahili i typed it in and then i had a bunch of stuff about the swahili coast which incidentally is like the like the pointy part of africa if you don't that's why on the on the eastern side right yeah yeah yeah okay i teach a unit about dalles and the swahili coast so sometimes i forget what is not just like casual common knowledge for the average american or person of the world um so yeah so i have a bunch of stuff about the swahili coast which was a trade center which seems relevant right like we're talking about trade in the monsoon world and i had a note about early african trade centers that i completely forgot about good power of yeah and no it's like fairly atomic yeah so i've got that one trading the monsoon rolls what i'm already working on early african trades case swahili cities yeah i'm just going to keep that hold on i don't need to i don't need to limit that anymore all right so that whole section and then the swahili themselves spaghetti society swahili merchants here's what i want how nice how nice i was just thinking about going back to that book and then you just pulled it up beyond the blue horizon go enter on the keyboard but i always want to click it yeah i actually had a question about that book since you just pulled it up i know this is a detour but do you ever uh cull the the notes that you've extracted in in beyond the blue horizon by brian fagan so there you have his his book um and you had a lot of different pulled notes do you always keep those i'm just curious if you have an opinion on that so i uh that's an excellent question and to spare you sitting here for 20 minutes watching me like go through that process what i what i normally do is um i will start from something that looks like that looks like this right like this this is a raw data dump and what i normally do is i go through and i turn it into something that is much more like this and as i'm going if i'm like why did i highlight that that is a useless piece of information i will absolutely delete it i have deleted things before but even when you've even when i've like deleted stuff i wind up with like it's still here it's still 7 000 oh i see yeah it's still long yeah totally but i mean you can see like i i have notes to myself of i had a question useful for contextualization useful for this useful for that this is interesting because like this is all linked stuff it's all my economics notes and it's how nice this looks though i mean i have to say there's it's a you have a pretty nice theme here it's palliative i made it specifically for this because nobody else cares about the little quotation mark on the block quote which is there specifically for when i paraphrase stuff because if i have a long quote i'll paraphrase it and i still want to differentiate it from my own thought so i have a little code block that um here you look intrigued so i'm going to show you i am i am so i have a block for um here you see how there's not a little quotation mark i paraphrased it wow okay so gotcha that's really nice because the paraphrase is that strange area yeah i didn't want to misquote it somewhere that i didn't want to like claim it as my own and if i use this as a reference for something i want to know like that i didn't just pop off with that or pull it like i don't want to i don't want to think you know like is this something that i maybe misstated like there are some concepts that i'm reading about that i am i'm wildly unqualified to talk about right like i barely know what some of these words mean i have never heard of some of these civilizations as i'm reading this academic textbook on the topic of the entirety of africa from like nomads not even from pre-hominoids to the 1800s is the is the scope of civilizations of africa by christopher eckhart like i it's a lot really like i do not have a phd in history i am more alerted on the topic than a lot of people but i don't have a phd in this there is stuff in the world that if you'd if i had a phd would still be new information to me because the world is large so i just try to differentiate between like stuff okay i am curious about this but i think we should keep it going so basically you made what you did is you made a block quote class a special type of class for your css to to not have the quotations there which is very cool and something else when you're just highlighting something you get these really long things really there i don't i don't want all of this i can't engage with all of this not all of this is the important part so i will change it i will go bloop i'm not afraid of html i am it's a little scary but it's fine so okay what's the part of this i care about river pilots who first yelled into the okay so this i care about talks about egypt navigating muddy waters everyone shipped out with surrounding rod or nodded and waited cord oh that's cool land surveyors civil engineering there you go civil engineering tools were useful for sailors pilots would gate the distance from land expert to taking an interpretive death much of their knowledge landmarks come from inshore fisherfolk that seems obvious like duh i don't i don't need you to tell me that that large scale ocean sailors got their skills from practicing in like i don't need that that's obvious right i care and it's redundant this says the same thing which is like i'm not criticizing brian fagan sometimes you have to say things twice but this is the same thing as this right like we don't need to have the same thing in here three times this part's interesting pilots would gauge the distance taking and interpreting the depths local currents feel the wind that's important right like that's interesting i didn't realize that sailors would analyze how the wind feels in order to determine stuff i should have but i didn't and you know this is really two different thoughts they're both interesting but it's really two different thoughts so let's separate this out a little bit bloop isn't there a word for that something something atomic i've heard of such a term so matter for conjecture i don't care how far they went i don't really care about crete like somebody will really this is important to somebody but to me i like i'm not sitting here trying to figure out whether or not the egyptians did blah blah blah it's enough for me to say the egyptians traded with crete right like that's enough let's let's make it shorter so in these block uh block quote paraphrase areas you're doing two things one you're deleting so it's it's not going to be verbatim and two you are kind of adding your own thoughts there like you just did yeah i'm paraphrasing oh that's what they call it [Music] so yeah this this is interesting to me this tells me about egyptian ships who the egyptians traded with and so this is about how egyptian how egyptian ships changed because of cultural diffusion spelling is hard and then this was location rant unique identifiers they're great so that is basically how we do that so this is how egyptians learned to navigate the ocean okay and i could probably learn so you know what that's not useful right like that's what it is but that's not useful that's not information that's not what i learned egyptians learned to navigate the ocean from how do we want to free that coastal sailors and land and used land surveying tools now i have something useful i have a claim i have evidence and i can delete my note really this is an atomic note now it is yes that's that is a perfectly functional atomic note and the thing that i'm going to do that's going to make a whole bunch of people cringe is i'm going to leave it like this this is my controversial thing i'm not going to move it into its own file i'm cool with that and the reason is sheer laziness plus i i just i find it a little bit messy because if i did i would have to like do a new citation thing i would have to make it like link back and the note refractor plug-in is great but it's not perfect and i can do everything i want with this atomic note with it as a subheading yeah i think so i think that well i think laziness is always a good driver uh or non-driver if you will but i think yeah when it's something like a book or you know a big thing it does kind of make sense to you to keep them together because you can we can link to headers or even to blocks so that way it's all within the book um which is kind of the big object like um when there are some big objects out there books people like these things that we can just kind of associate with whatever it is that we're thinking about so i think that's important to kind of keep those together yeah and i when i discovered when i used the refractor plug-in i i tried splitting them up with civilizations of africa it's like man like a 7 000 word note that's really long so i did it and i got to here and the thing is i don't always give it a heading i don't actually always want to go through the trouble of making those notes properly atomic it's a time consuming process i just want to do the parts that matter to me now and keep the parts that might matter to me later and not make this a job exactly it's not a job this isn't a job this is something i do for a purpose the job is not making beautiful notes the job is writing articles so even if i don't touch this for another three days which is extremely possible i've still gotten something useful out of it and further i could go write a whole article about tribute economies and the nature of economy really i've still done that i have still based on this you know process where i really only got like you know three or four notes in i've still gotten a lot of useful stuff out of it and as i go through it and process it which is a lengthy process i will still have more and more and more to mine from it but the point isn't to turn my literature note into a beautiful literature note that's not that's not why we're here that's what we have to not lose sight of so i can go give myself a to-do list finish processing i can type i swear finish processing that and then i'm going to update i read some more of beyond the blue horizon and my big takeaway for the day was here's the important part and my big takeaway for the day was that tribute economies and what's the word i want in and are a this isn't how i want to phrase it a type of thing that hasn't been plumbed enough in fiction there's so much more we could do with how the people of china cared about having the surrounding cultures pay tribute to them and why why do i do this because every month i go back and i look at everything in my reading log and i sit down and go all right what's important what's not important what's worth sharing what should i follow up on now with the space of a month is there something that i like you know should really go back to do i have some new insight with the space of a month i try to sit down and actually keep track of what i read but not every pile of nonsense thing that i read while i was killing time waiting for my coffee right like it's not ask a manager like you know random advice blog thing that i keep track of it's stuff that matters to me that i keep track of you can't you can't spend more time keeping track of things than you do enjoying things that's that way lies misery but you should probably take some time to reflect on what you learn that matters to you because otherwise you're going to forget it right like i had completely forgotten about like six of the things that came up during this this process like oh yeah i had talked about this with hillary close a lot oh yeah i actually do know a ton about that and then i put it together and i did stuff with it so also noted so actually that's an accomplishment right like that's not a reading log thing i let's reflect i had some interesting insights about economics today so when i do my monthly review one i know what i cared about what i was thinking about and then i can remind myself we should think harder as a species about things that aren't money because money is not the only thing that makes the world go around boom right yeah i had an insight today and i wrote it down and i filed it away and i'll come back to it and that's something that came out of reading a very dry academic textbook about the nature of sailing throughout history there are so many um minor insights here that that i that i hope that those i don't mean minor in any derogatory way but i mean that i want to pull out small to make sure that anyone watching this might might take away from it and that's what i wanted to say is as you're doing your reading log it's not just i read this you're you're saying here's another prompt like if i'm just going to really like pull it out and and stare at it you have a prompt that says my big takeaway and then you write about it and that's you're forcing yourself to to be an active participant in in what you're putting together you're not just saying i read this and then that that's uh that's lazy in that bad sense because then it's less um solidified in the mind and then i like that you do have a a monthly review obviously so then you can go back and like you said with the space of a month or whatever that that space is and you can look at it with a fresher eyes and kind of see what really you know stood out so this is okay so what parts of our process are we currently of your process do we still need to cover or have we yeah i mean i feel like we've covered everything that i that i do for like i mean like i'm not gonna sit here and make you watch me write an article right like you you've you heard me opine on the topic of an article under normal circumstances i would have opined in such a way into my phone which would have outputted you know voice to text into obsidian mobile and then it would have become a thing that i edited so i think we've hit all of the stages and you kind of just do like you opine like you just did on this call right like during that uh new uh moc no when you're just talking out loud and quizzing me that was essentially what you're doing you're asking a lot of questions you're asking a lot of whys and um you're you're you're digging into it you're you're having a conversation yeah sometimes with my phone it's more fun with you yeah the phone doesn't talk back as much the phone does not talk back nor does my son not not yet sounds like that's going to happen pretty soon though yeah so yeah i mean i guess any questions like was this helpful well this oh this was um tremendously helpful i um i was hoping to save a few for the end but then i couldn't help myself but interject questions while we went so i'm trying to think uh as i did my best to just ask as we went along because it was um so inspiring that way another thing that stood out for me is you know the power of yaml with data view as as something as a simple solution i guess one thing that i'm looking forward to is i saw how you're using it for blogs and article ideas i'm hoping to also see how it could be used for uh mocs or other types of notes uh yeah that's that's all my to-do list sort of i haven't i really do think that what's gonna happen is like you would use it as like a tag the problem is i don't i don't know how well uh dataview works for if it's multiple so you should be able to just tag it with whatever your moc is it's like if you have a economics moc you should be able to do like moc economics or like literally just tags economics and then if it's also marriage right like if it's if it's if it's a thing about why people pay dowries for for you know marriage then it would go into both and then i think dataview will let you just probably get a list of everything that's tagged with that so if you did that you wanted basically you wanted to add it to moc that and then you would tag it like that and then dataview would just spit out a list of everything you've given that tag yeah it's interesting and then you would as you as you so like it's like the backlinks pane but more more fine-grained and then what i would personally do is as i actually manually added into my moc um with still like marriage i'll i don't like to just have because this isn't just a list right lists are worthless i have a list over here my my list is my files um i want to know why it's in this list but like i don't i'm not always the best at updating it as i go what i want is a thing at the bottom that's like unprocessed and then all of like it's like a to-do list right so i don't have to find it in the back links pane with all of the things that are linking to it to say do this and also linking to it because it's useful yeah relevant like i want to separate those things out and dataview basically lets you search it lets you give yourself a to-do list without having to navigate to it yeah no you just nailed it there that that makes the perfect sense perfect sense because then we haven't done it again okay so the way to use i'm just saying this out loud for myself um the way to use data view for mocs is um as a as a curated backlinks um a temporary curated backlinks list potentially i'm not saying that's the only way but that might be a way to experiment with where it's at the bottom of your mlc note you still have all your custom contacts that you've manually gone through the the fire to create and you figure out all this nice structure they've had interactions conversations and you say okay we'll start with why here get the definitions down then we'll go into some details relevant newsletters relevant newsletters atomic notes questions references okay so that's our mlcs and then below all that we'll have the unsorted stuff that's related to marriage and and then we'll have whatever data we think is relevant and then we can have it as part of that table at the bottom okay i'm just talking out loud no no yeah i mean that's that's sort of how i envision it in my head basically how i have over here like where this is a tag with where i'm gonna put it it should be possible the only thing is my lit notes are really long and like yaml has to be at the top so i don't know i i haven't really dug into it there there is definitely potential there particularly with like real atomic notes like this is the downside of doing it my way is that if you have actual like just like so like you would do it with your this stuff right like i could have this have some kind of metadata at the top that's like and i have a text expander don't mind me it's hilariously hard to make this okay there we go my my dash dash turns into an m dash and i really need to change that um okay so we would want this to be tag right and then what we would do is to be processed you want some kind of dataview thing that does that's not it there we go okay that's so we want some kind of data view thing that does this where yeah okay gotcha i'm actually like i don't really use yaml a lot so we're gonna pretend that's right okay actually just for the sake of simplicity yes keep it in quotes okay okay so we don't have a current status we just want a table we're just to do it real easy for now that should theoretically work hey it worked look at that except we actually want to list look at that look at me i did that first time and look it like doesn't even look weird right like it's just look weird it totally fits there yeah so that's pretty impressive how you could do it without having the only thing is it won't um because it's a data thing it won't show up in the backlinks but like the whole point is that it's not processed right like you you i should process it later but at least it's still there i don't have to go finding it i don't have to go looking around it's just there it's not beautiful yeah yeah yeah well it is i must say it is so that is the stuff that the funny thing about some knowledge management personal knowledge management thing is the the the things that we try they work on longer time scales where we don't really know the results until you know a few weeks or months or whatever it is down the road um and this is one that is worth experimenting with and kind of seeing how it feels after a few months um for for me at least with uh yeah yeah because the immediate weakness is what if i want to add it to mfcs and i'm sure that it's possible i just i don't actually know how like there's there's got to be a way to use like tags and you can definitely have multiple tags so i i don't know but like as a proof of concept that's what it would look like which is pretty cool yeah it's pretty impressive just to have it at the bottom like that um yeah okay very cool okay what else i think we've covered almost everything and this is extremely extremely helpful so what else do we need to to mention i don't know i guess i uh started with the book we did the resonance calendar thing we've done the reading roundups we've done the literature notes so i've i think i've shown you how i match i don't know if i've shown you how i match like multiple so one of the things that i do i can just show you really quick is when i'm synthesizing things um here we go a lot of the times if i'm reading a text i will have a thought and then i will see something else in the literature in the literature note that's like the same topic what i usually do is i will pull them out into just a statement and then all of the proofs okay and then i have the proof and this is why i i keep the big literature notes because i do this as i go and if you refractor later all of these links break oh interesting because they're going to headings and if you use the refractor plug-in it will just make it like just the title and the idea of going through every atomic note that i have and update it makes me want to die inside totally so that's that's that's the real reason i do it that way but um this is an example you can imagine how if i had come across two or three different things in the in the um the brian book about sailing like i could have put them together like oh yeah these these three things are all on the same topic let me put them over here so i do that a lot um and sometimes when i have questions they go into the questions file but relatively rarely i'm not actually going to put the wide attribute economy questions existing here i i know why they exist i was i was just messing with you i knew it it was a little bit messy yeah that's great but like as a thought experiment not just yeah no no no that's your and i and um i really appreciate the you're obviously a great teacher because you you keep everyone engaged and on their toes um okay well this is the only other thing and this might um detour us from this but is there is there a simple final product um to show us like from your blog or an article or something that relates to sure here let's uh let's see what we've got um probably not those [Music] here we go this is a good one so i'm not done this this is a very much a work in progress but as i was reading um the civilizations of africa i came across this notion of sacral kingship and the idea is that um they're in in various ancient societies in africa and not just africa they're um we find these tombs with with you know people of great wealth who are buried with like 15 or 20 like 20 year olds who are very clearly just like sort of mass kills together which to the modern sentiment is very like why are we why are we killing your attendance to go with you into the afterlife but it's actually a like a weirdly common thing uh like the egyptians um may have had it i don't actually remember um but the there there was definitely sacral queenship in bronze age iraq which i came across in a totally different book and the people of carthage practiced like human sacrifice and sort of the aztecs and why is human sacrifice such a such a thing i don't know i i don't i don't have that answer yet but it's definitely a thing and and does that relate to the terracotta army and and what about the the scythian burial practices where they put their favorite horse in the tomb with them to go into the afterlife like what is it about humanity where we die and then other people die with us wait is that similar to the the city in in um in in india where there's this practice where a woman will basically like throw herself under her husband's funeral pile because wait that happened in carthage when dido killed herself to protect her people from being married off to an african king what is going on with humanity where this is a thing that keeps coming up and stuff i've read so you can see yeah where you can you can see my links right like i got this from civilizations of africa and i i wrote a thing about alyssa of carthage that was based on um elizabeth carthage's dido like the the legendary dido of founding of carthage for context uh so i read an academic like pdf about her once and then brother of kings has and it just keeps coming up and i notice the connection and i'm i'm working on turning it into a final product and right now it's just amusing but at some point this is going to become an article that looks much more like this right infrastructure in ancient civilizations i have a thesis i have a statement i have things to say on the topic oh my god do i have things to say on the topic of infrastructure in ancient civilization civil engineering my friends did not begin with rome civil engineering did not even begin with the city-state humans were building enormous miles long walls like before the we built the first city we use them as hunting traps large public infrastructure products pre-date human civilization it is not a roman invention i have really strong feelings i'm happy to soapbox about that at length and have done so on dan coleman's blog um like the it's just wood isn't primitive and all you really need to build an enormous infrastructure process is a government and a bunch of people that's it that's all that's all you need you need a bunch of people in a government and i mean government in the loosest possible sense you need a bunch of people and somebody in charge like only kind of you need a bunch of people and consensus that's it that's what you need for civil engineering you need a bunch of people in consensus boom done that's it that's all you need yeah wow you need a bunch of people and a consensus that is necessary and that is what you need for civil engineering and i'm going to write that down and that's an article that i have bookmarked because you haven't hope you've enjoyed it you need a bunch of people people and a consensus to do something and anything is possible from us from a civil engineering perspective infrastructure the romans did not invent civil engineering i'm gonna pop that i don't know i have so many feelings about that i'm going to pop that over into insights did i move the right thing yes i did no not copy delete come on inside so i should probably name that right and the zoom thing is messing with me okay so let's make that shorter people plus consensus and you can and anything is possible and infrastructure building people plus consensus equals infrastructure projects which which uh makes me think about the struggles that america has had with infrastructure week which is uh the week that keeps on going for the past several several years and has never happened whereas then if you look the argument goes anyways if you look at china for instance they can erect however many beds in wuhan to deal with the pandemic virtually overnight and just do insane projects virtually overnight potentially because of this consensus wherever that's coming from versus the lack of consensus in in america currently with infrastructure we lack the political will we do not lack the technology and people always think that all it takes to do something is technology and what it actually takes is political will the people of jericho i don't remember how many millions of years ago could build walls that dwarf most american houses and all it takes is consensus and people you know what's funny to that point as well we're watching for all mankind which is an alternate reality of what happens if the russians landed on the moon first and it what it does in this series is it gives the political will to both countries to continue um their space explorations and advancements and so it's it's interesting to see how they they they paint a world where things some things happen a little bit sooner or they still haven't happened yet in in our reality because we we've lacked we've abandoned that will which is starting to pick up speed hopefully it appears with some private enterprises getting involved in it but yeah just to your point of political will um i really dig that that's me full of insights about social studies yes wonderful well eleanor this was just fantastic and there's so much that i've received from this that i've just gotten from this it gets me really excited um and i know this will help other people too so thank you so so much for for this any parting words before we stop the recording just don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good is that voltaire it's like seven different people i'm just kidding i got it from a old i don't know maybe i got it from a boss i used to i used to work in special education department and um schools are chronically underfunded is maybe the wrong word like not to get political but like there's just never enough resources in the school to do it why ever that might be i don't want to say it's because there's not enough money but there's there's just never enough resources to help all of the people who need to be helped they're just possible you can't do it and i had a boss once who you know when we were getting overwhelmed because there was just so much she's like if you can't do it perfect do it good enough the important thing is that you do something and it stuck with me and whether that's voltaire or you know some guy on the internet the point is that you just don't get bogged down and making your notes perfect yes keep your eye on the prize and remember what you're there for and what you're trying to do and just think critically and engage in metacognition and and figure out why you're doing something and if what you're spending time on does not serve the y get rid of it i spent three hours trying to bug fix git today and i just i deleted it because it wasn't solving my problem like it's supposed to be a version control that works automatically and after it basically destroyed my vault today because i pulled when i shouldn't have been blah blah blah and somehow it got moved and erased and like i it wasn't worth it it's the perfect tool for what i need and if it doesn't work it's not worth it i would rather have good enough windows has something that does almost something the same i already have obsidian sync and you know like i don't need it to be the perfect most beautiful tool that any programmer has ever made
