this is the q a time and i will stay 
as long as as people have questions   as long as it doesn't stretch into like 
three hours how do mocs differ from   structure notes and that's asked by anonymous 
attendee so mocs i tried to answer this a little   bit but and we go into this in depth in in the 
workshop but in mlc in a structure note are very   very similar because you have a regular note 
what is a note a note is a container of thought   okay so let's make sure we have our definitions 
that's what a note is it's a container of   thought an moc and structure note hub note um 
outline zettle all of these are notes with links   to other notes that's their main focus right 
that's that's their main description uh it's   not to say a regular note can't have a link or 
two but things like structure notes their purpose   is to link out to other notes and and to provide 
you with a sense of how notes are connected   the reason moc is different is because it has it's 
much more fluid it's not just being an index note   and i hope i showed that with the concepts moc an 
moc allows you multiple ways to rework these same   links based on what you're trying to accomplish 
it is way more flexible it is way more fluid   that's not to say that you can't do that with a 
structure note but that's not the purpose of a   structure note every definition i read of 
the structure note that's not the purpose   but in essence both of those notes where they 
overlap in similarity of the venn diagram is that   they are assembling links to other notes okay next 
question let's see i'm going to look in the chat let's see what do you think dimitri what do 
you think how do you utilize tags for the   most effective connections great question um when 
the note is abstract meta future self so yeah how   can we make sure our future self finds notes 
and how can we use tags to to help with that   well i mean if you saw the new graph view 
it was basically like you know the uh   the the rumors of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated that's how i feel about tags you know   um i i know rome which is a fantastic program kind 
of did away with tags um i don't know like and i   don't have the ultimate answer here so we are all 
learning together let me just preface with that   but with this new graph feature in an obsidian i'm 
starting to really recognize the value of a tag   and it tracks with i had an article called in what 
ways can we make relationships between notes tags   are weak links you don't always want a direct link 
you're right you don't always want to say that's   that's my brother and that's my sister and that's 
my mother and that's my father sometimes you just   want to say like hey we kind of live in the 
same town or you know we play bingo together   random example you want a weak 
relationship and that's what a tag can do   so i tried to show this in in the video 
about the graph but off the top of my head   i mean i'm trying to think of a good one i find 
the best tags and i think most people would agree   are actionable ones like something that you take 
an action on and so here i have the develop so   this tells me the note has been created it might 
be good already but i want to make it better or   it might basically have nothing in it so these 
existing files only so these are the the the   notes that i want to develop and i'm using a 
tag to denote that and then once i've i'm done   developing it let's go into priming once i feel 
like this isn't bad i'm okay with priming but   i know there's so much more to develop but once 
i'm done developing it i just get rid of develop   as a tag and there you have it then it won't 
show up in the graph that's one use of tag as far as to save that for another time 
kevin says asks is there any software   available that will convert evernote notes 
to markdown effectively kevin someone in this   webinar right now has the answer so i want i want 
that person to speak up and and say what the best   approach they have i did my evernote 
conversion when it was so painful in 2015   so don't don't be me there are better methods 
out there so someone answered kevin's question   how to convert their evernote notes uh 
gustav light seems like a set of principles   of organizing things you know what i'm going to 
type this so you guys can see the questions too um how would you how would an empty light kit look 
what does light add to xenocostin as you mentioned   is the base yes so light adds the map of contents 
light adds the home note what are these things   they are fluid frameworks they are frameworks 
that basically float on top of your xedelkosten   independent note structure and from these 
frameworks that's how we can not only organize   and structure this information but what i'm really 
trying to advocate for when it comes to an moc   is that's how we develop information we talk 
about folders being top down and we talk about   um notes organically zettlecostin is bottom 
up a map of content is middle out it informs   the notes above it informs the the individual 
notes below that is the true power and so until   you've experienced it it's hard to consider an 
moc more than just an index node a structure note   but once you realize oh i get all these notes in 
a room together and i get them to fight it out   and battle it out and they become sharper 
they become better arguments they become   clearer notes and not only is that great for 
the end product but your process of doing that   makes you that much better of a thinker makes you 
that much more um able to recall the information   because you've done the work that's not note 
taking that's no making pretty awesome right okay   next question is there uh can i use light 
with foglesettle oh rabbit hole alert i   will say this that is the beauty of a map of 
content is it employs focal settle elements   right but you don't have the limitations of 
focal settle because i'm not going to go into it   but vocal zeddle means that you have all of your 
notes and they're in one specific rigid structure   another version of fogalcital is just using a an 
arbitrary timestamp you know why not just do that   but the point being is a map of content 
allows me to create a fluid vocal zeddle   let that sink in for you focal zettle users 
this is fluid because i can organize these ideas   a million different ways and i showed 
that in the concept moc right this is just   a version of a focal zeddle these ideas are 
lined up one after another but then i do it in   a different way right here so hopefully that makes 
uh some light bulbs go off for full result users   all right thank you so much for everyone who's 
attended we're just going to keep going i can't   believe that everybody is here and they're still 
asking so many great questions is there a way to   auto populate the backlinks in a non eponymous 
note uh i.e any time concepts moc is used   the note referencing it auto populates 
the concepts mlc node oh okay so basically   is there a way that i don't have to manually 
put the note in um that's what backlinks do   so if you're in a rush and you don't have the 
time to actually place a new note in your moc   all you have to make sure i'm trying to find 
an example of where this might be the case   goals law yeah this is okay so who asked 
that question sarah so sarah your question   it's as simple as this go to your moc and 
look into the backlinks section i'm just   going to collapse them and then you say which 
of these notes have i not actually put into it manually put into this you can or you you don't 
have to but a good example is gold's law it's not   in this anywhere but in gold's law guess what i 
linked to the concept moc so that means in the   concept moc there is a backlink or a better better 
term for it is a linked mention right here awesome   all right so we're on to david's question we're about a quarter of the way through 
the questions yeah i'll answer all of them   if you stick around then stick 
around feel free to go as well   and we'll make sure you get 
everything you need david asks   and hey let me just put this into the chat it's 
kind of strange how these windows work in zoom can you talk about your process of building notes 
before you get to mapping them great yeah okay   so bottom up approach what's the relationships 
between say literature notes and more evergreen   notes how are you tracking sources attributions 
or do you bother okay so let's let's approach that   in this i'm using the light kit for the example 
here david i'm going to go into where is it at   so douglas hoff's daughter i i watched this 
youtube video a few months back and i just   decided let me take notes on this and kind of 
you know give a good example for everyone so as   my notes initially you did not look this 
pretty but i did go back and you know   pretty them up a little bit but i'm just taking 
notes right using um kind of an outline format and   when i got to a note that i thought i wanted to i 
was like whoa this is yeah this is a new concept   then i was like okay let's make a new note and 
then put that information here and so that's what   concept expansion became now this is my literature 
note right here in sources so i can always go back   to this literature note and kind of get the 
additional context the big note i want to say   with literature notes that you see here these are 
my words these are my thoughts and it's it's me   interpreting what i listen to and if if i did 
quote something because it was so perfect i will   quote it here so i always remember that so that's 
how i make sure to do the attributions properly   i'm not as rigorous about the attributions as 
a true academic that's me personally but you   can be there's nothing preventing you from 
being that level of rigor i always want to   make sure i attribute ideas to the right person 
however because that's just the right thing to do   but let's say i'm here here's a good example back 
to the concepts map and then i'm looking in linked   mentions and oh what's this concept expansion 
click on that here we are and then i'm like oh   let's go back to the quote literature note and 
then i'm back to the literature now so i hope   i hope that help answered your question answer 
your question david about uh literature notes   and and and by the way none of that used a 
map so that's just you know bottom up working how is light compared to para or other pkm methods i'll be careful with this one   i would say at the at the heart of it all is 
light is flexible and you customize your system   para depends on four folders and it seems like 
every other comment in the world of linking   with obsidian and rome is they they'll say 
something like well i use para but i don't use   the a or you know i kind of blend this and that 
so if it's helpful for you do that um i think   when you change your your mindset from folders 
to links uh para kind of loses a lot of its value   this is another valuable note 
though there are uses for para   people are using para in or pera i don't know 
in obsidian quite effectively uh one of the mods   on the uh obsidian forum um discord channel 
they're using para they're doing a lot of project   management and that's truly the big point here 
hey if you're a project manager if that's the real   reason that you're using your notes your digital 
notes then you probably yeah try to do that whole   par approach however that's not my main audience 
and i hope that's not you to any i mean yeah sure   we all manage stuff what i want to manage what 
i want to develop where i want to spend my time   is with ideas with memories with making sense 
out of things that's the beauty of linking your   thinking now if you just want to manage people and 
manage projects then you know project management   can happen in obsidian it can happen in rome 
it can happen in these linked networking apps   but it's just not um where i'm going to put 
my attention and because of that para makes   zero sense for me um and what i'm trying to get at 
is you need to make your custom system when it's   based on links links change the game so we have 
to you know consider everything from a blank slate   what's going to work best and that blank slate 
for me is these are some folders honestly these   folders could change maybe i decide i don't really 
need workspaces because i'm linking my thoughts but if i have a business then i might have a 
workspace just for those notes because those   things are tend to tend to be more together so i 
hope that answers without getting into it too much you
