[Music] if you are tired of constantly feeling overwhelmed with information and losing momentum on your creative efforts then linking your thinking might be your missing piece to the puzzle hi i'm nick milo and in this video series you will learn how and why you should link your thinking you will learn how to do it how to do it well and how to do it for years to come you will see how you can grow your own ideaverse a well-connected thinking environment that is 100 yours to get there we're going to start with a forest of notes that we call the light kit light is spelled l-y-t and it is an acronym for linking your thinking the light kit is without a doubt the world's most downloaded starter kit for linked notes now as we step inside of the light kit together we're going to act like a child stepping into a sandbox we're going to explore experiment and learn by doing that's how you will truly unlock the power of linking your thinking you ready okay let's step inside okay now we are in the light kit at the simplest level the light kit is just a folder with around 250 files but those files that we're looking at right now let's call them notes and these notes point to each other over a thousand times let's call each one of these points a link so we have in front of us 250 notes linked over 1000 times and once you get to that many links your ideas start to behave like a living breathing ecosystem like a forest a planet even a universe we might call this an ideaverse but we'll come back to that for now here's how we make a link now in the light kit anywhere and i want you to get very comfortable hitting return hitting backspace whatever it is i'm going to hit the bracket icon so bracket bracket and now it's pulling up those 250 plus notes and it's allowing me to make a link to one of them so in this case i could make a link to let's say note note takers interesting so that was the first one that came up note takers now before we go any further i just want to let you see a little bit about what's happening in this application called obsidian in the middle we have our document what we're calling a note now on the left we have folders they're holding all the notes there are some other icons don't worry about that for now on the right we have a couple panes but the one we're focused on are tags we can tag notes you might be familiar with tags let's leave them alone for now and in the bottom right one of the interesting parts of linked notes is that there are notes that mention other notes and what you can see over here are 33 different notes that mention this very special note called the light kit because it's essentially our central map of content for the entire light kit that we're looking at so from these 33 links you'll be able to get to those other 250 notes all from here and now let's see how links can help us think better and empower us to generate insights so looking at the light kit here and i want you to do the same just start scrolling through until we land somewhere that we might want to check out in this case i'm going to go to habits map of content moc i'll close this for now and i'm going to click on the first link i see here which is defining a habit defining a habit so on this habits map of content let me start with the definition that's what i did here and then as we're reading through this you can do that on your own time i want to see where it's taking me if i click on feedback loop okay so now i've clicked on another note and it's taking me right to feedback loop the more you feed me the more i feed you we can read about feedback loops related at the bottom habits carry a ton of hidden inertia so i'm creating this almost choose your own adventure experience for myself but as i do that i'm making better sense of everything to do with what with habits so let's go for now to habits carry a ton of hidden inertia excellent so we can read through this one and here's where i want to show you a couple other things look at this we have all sorts of interesting links starting to happen not just about habits but what's this jim collins flywheel and mary shelley's frankenstein monster i thought we were talking about habits this is what happens when you start linking your thinking your idea verse takes on character that you would have never imagined we've put ourselves in a position to naturally generate insights and win so looking at this note now i have a choice i could go up to the habits map of content kind of close to where we started or i could look at this and say hey let's write an article out of this maybe let's make it into a video let's do something and share it online in the world wide web what toy should we do and hey get this see this a blink at the top it's not an uplink it is a top link now for background in 2020 when i introduced the first light kit i also introduced the practice of adding a top link and that practice has spread because it makes sense now why is that because it helps you make sense of things you have to make a choice you can only have one top link and sometimes in this case it's an uplink but just as often it can be an across link literally a cross as in an intersection as in guess what an x an x is a cross x marks the spot so it can be an uplink sometimes or it can be what we might say is across link no matter what though you can only have one at the top if you practice good linking your thinking habits and it is a top link the top most relevant link so now we have a choice within a choice do i show an example of the x link or do i just go up right now let me show an example real fast so i'm going to go over here to search and hit x colon colon and we're going to oh look at this note takers so let's open up note takers in a different tab and we can see that note takers has an across link to note makers so i've told myself that the most relevant link to this note called note takers is note makers that makes a lot of sense right it'd be kind of silly if i said this was up to note makers they're on the same level right so it's across and the easiest perfectly fuzzy way to represent that is a simple x so before we go into note makers let's look at note takers and the definition here these are people who spend too much time consuming information passively and we've all been there but in response to the information age these are people who constantly fall into the trap of mindlessly trying to collect everything meaning they don't have any time for actual thinking contrast that with the note makers note makers are people who spend their thinking time in an active engaged way making sense of the stuff they encounter and you can read the rest below but isn't that pretty cool so that's what happens now we're going to close that choice branch of the choose your adventure game we're going to come back to habits carry a ton of hidden inertia i'm not going to write an article so let me close that choice and i'm going to choose to go back up so with that in mind i'm going to click back to the habits map of content and here we are this should look familiar from when i entered defining a habit and let's say i'm done thinking about habits or i just kind of want to get my bearings again it's easy to get turned around if i want to orient myself i'm just going to go to the top link in this case it's an uplink let me put my cursor right here click cool the three phases of mlcs if i keep my cursor there and click again on the up link now i'm in the mlc's overview if i move my cursor and just click again i'm back to where we started the light kit and let's go all the way home one more click takes me home and we'll come back here i promise in a later video in this series hey if you haven't already you just have to download and wander around the light kit once you download it i'll email you step by step instructions to show you how to open it up in obsidian but the real value is getting all of the exercises not included in this video series it's about getting the reps so get the kit and get the reps can you see the power of linking your thinking i navigated around my notes effortlessly and if i wanted to write an article on habits i was 80 of the way there and all of my resources were in a single spot it would have been really easy and a lot of fun but even if i never write a single article to the outside world my work here will still pay off every single day i live because when i link my thinking i can't help but make better sense of my world and when i leave this behind i take this with me and this interplay between me and my thinking environments is all part of my idea verse more on that in the next video but basically the links i make in my custom idea verse directly wire the links in my inner idea verse and that makes every future choice every future decision an opportunity for a better richer more fulfilling outcome you simply must start linking your thinking because it's both practical and priceless okay now after each video in this series take a moment and get a couple reps before watching the next one that means click around make a link or two why because you're not here to watch me work you're here to learn how to consistently take your thinking to the next level and how do you do that by getting the reps get the repetitions in the next video you'll learn how we got into all the bad habits in the first place all the over collecting all of the over highlighting and how the key to fixing this mess is not note-taking it's note making until then stay connected [Music] you
