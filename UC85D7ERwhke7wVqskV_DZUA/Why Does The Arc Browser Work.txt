I want to share one of the worst software habits I've ever had I used to pop up tabs constantly when I was browsing the web if a window got too many tabs I'd make a new window and then I'd fill up that one too week after week I'd do this I could end up with dozens and dozens of open tabs eventually the browser gets so slow that I'd quit using that browser and switch to a different browser so I'd fill up Safari ditch it fill up Chrome ditch it fill up Firefox ditch it Philip Brave I think you know where I'm going then when I've got no browsers left I'd go back to Safari where I just close all those precious tabs and forget about all of them now hopefully you're not that bad but safe to say a lot of us are neck deep in tabs and tabs are being used in a way that I'm sure nobody ever intended them to be in this video I'm going to talk about the tab problem the tab solution and how the web browser can be a better workspace and place to think hi I'm Nick Milo and I'm here to help you do your best thinking and most inspired work more often let's let's take a moment to understand tabs a bit tabs were not designed to be a way to manage information they were just a simple way to flip between a few pages but browsers have become Information Management systems for most of us they're the main way we access information and the thing is they are bad information management systems and one of the chief reasons they are so bad is you guessed it tabs I mean how many tabs you have open right now go look post your number down in the comments below actually I asked the community this and about half of you 44 had more than 13 tabs open another 21 of you had 6 to 12 open which is still quite a lot Tabs are essentially a pile of pages your browser is a workspace we do a lot of thinking here so your workspace becomes the equivalent of a desk with piles of stuff on it plenty of brilliant people work this way so you know don't beat yourself up over this too much if this is how you work but I think tabs make us feel confused over overwhelmed and a little disheartened sometimes because you end up playing this information management game that you are just slowly and inevitably losing so the tab problem is this browsers are bad information management systems and the main reason they're so bad are tabs so if that's the problem what's the solution I think the best solution is a new tool a browser that is designed as an information management system as a workspace and that browser exists and it's called Arc now Arc is Mac only right now but a Windows version is coming soon it is an invite only beta so you need to join the waitlist or get an invite from someone already using it Arc is a chromium-based browser so under the hood it's all Google Chrome meaning that your extensions if you use any they're all going to work arc's big idea is that it merges tabs with bookmarks and then orders them in a cohesive way and it does some cleanup for you I'll explain all that shortly it's a unique interface and it may cause you a bit of frustration because we're so used to the old way the tab way but I'm hoping this video will lessen that frustration and I assure you that the minor learning curve is well worth it so how does Arc work Tabs are gone from the top and they now live along the side this is surprisingly great because managing Pages vertically is just simply better than managing them horizontally you can see all the text for starters or at least enough of it and it's quicker and easier to drag stuff up and down than it is side to side now think about it you can put pages in folders and open or close them as you see fit you can select several Pages at once and close them basically the way that you manage files already on your computer you can now do that with your browser tabs it's like finally in Arc there are three types of tabs let's talk this through because it might sound kind of weird but it's pretty simple you can make these buttons at the top for your priority sites these are called favorites lots of people will want their email there or slack or their calendar or Spotify these buttons are actually like bookmarks and tabs at the same time whoa these stay here until you remove them so if you close one of these tabs by hitting command W you've closed the window but the button stays put because it's also a bookmark in order to remove it you have to right click it and archive it if this seems confusing or odd once you understand how this interface Works overall it will make sense this middle section these are called pinned tabs and they are similar to the favor buttons with one difference I'll get to shortly then in this bottom section these are the old fashioned tabs we love and hate when you make a new tab it appears down here and they close like normal tabs and ladies and gentlemen here's the twist these tabs Auto close after a certain amount of time the default is 12 hours which I find a bit short I set it to 24 hours and I'm happy with that you can make it a week or even a month you'll be surprised at how in frequently you notice these tabs Auto closing so the arc browser does some cleanup for you and protects you from yourself and if you want to pin one of these tabs just drag it up here want it to be a button yep drag it up here and close tabs are all still readily accessible in your archive which is very similar to history you can reopen by hitting command T which is the shortcut for a new tab so if you think oh where did that Wikipedia page go command T type some bit of the name and boom it reopens now it seems kind of trivial to call this the archive but that's actually an interesting conceptual shift all the pages that come through your browser become part of your archive your browsing becomes a searchable index your own little library now I suspect this feature isn't quite fully cooked yet but I think the archive feature is quite promising and you can switch among open tabs with control tab similar to switching among apps this actually looks a lot like the Windows app switcher you should try it out now Good Start Right Arc makes tabs easier to manage it cleans up some of your messes and it gives you a good way to access those old closed tabs but you might be thinking not a lot of space over here right seems like this sidebar will get crowded and confusing well actually no because you have as many bars as you need arc has spaces if you swipe left or right with a trackpad or hold shift and scroll with the mouse wheel you can flip between these spaces and those favorite buttons at the top they persist across all spaces you can always get to those but the rest of the buttons only appear in the space you put them in so you can have a workspace with slack and Gmail and figma and you can have a play space with YouTube and Discord and Twitter just hit this plus button and make a new space and you can name them give them an icon give them a color and check out this detailing you can even add noise to the color to give it some cool texture this program is filled with these delightful little details like this these developers really put a lot of love into this program now to rearrange Spaces by the way you can just click and drag the icons also it's quick and easy to hide this sidebar you hit command s which is save historically but we mostly don't need to do that in web browsers so it's really an underused hotkey so the S stands for sidebar and it's very easy to get to this with your hand then you are in this full screen immersive environment this just feels better than having all that browser UI junk around you it's so much nicer for focused work if you need to work in figma for a bit let's say you can just hide everything else and just concentrate on that just like you're in a dedicated desktop app this sidebar it's basically the interface everything is here what these features thus far do is this they let you spatially arrange the pages in your workspace and you can hide the stuff that you don't need right now it is clunky or impossible to do this with traditional browser tabs those are the fundamentals of the arc browser Arc takes those windows that were floating around in the tab bar and in different windows and in your bookmark bar and your history and it puts them into an ordered and cohesive space just this alone is an upgrade from the other browsers but Arc is way better than this around these big core features they somehow have added lots of smaller and equally great features Arc is exceptional for focused work because it reduces clutter and it has this great full screen mode but sometimes we're multitasking sometimes we're doing light work and we want to watch Netflix at the same time so it's equally great for all those multitasking activities another cool feature that I use numerous times per day is picture in picture so if you're watching a video and you switch to a different page age you get this awesome pop-up video player I've been really surprised at how much I love this how seamlessly it works it's great for work like watching a tutorial while you want to work on the application you're in at the same time and it's great for play sometimes I'll have a TV show running here while I'm doing some cleanup stuff on the computer equally nice Spotify controls will stay over here in your sidebar it's these little touches that make this browser into something truly truly special Arc has another amazing and yet simple thing that no other popular browser has split views I'm on YouTube and I want to sort email at the same time I can just open a split view and I've got them both another thing that helps prevent tab hoarding is a feature called little Arc hit command option n anywhere start typing a site name and boom you get this mini browser with almost no UI if I want to check a movie time let's say I can just pop up a little Arc I can take a look I can close it done it's a simple way to keep unimportant tabs from getting mixed up with all the important ones here's another brand new feature They just added right now Peak if you click a link to another site you get this pop-up preview you click away and it's gone so great we are entering the home stretch friends just a quick mention of some other notable features firstly for obsidian users here's a fantastic one hit command option shift C and you get a markdown link you get the page title with a link I use this all the time it's incredibly handy and you can also hit command shift C to just get the URL also over here on the left is something called the library which has screenshots even your desktop and also your downloads the most notable feature however is called easel which lets you grab screenshots and type text and draw lines and arrows it's kind of like canvas in obsidian I've not gotten into using this but something I really like here is that it maintains links to where everything came from so when you take a screenshot you can easily get back to the original Source that's whoa that's really amazing and screenshots they are awesome in Arc look at how your cursor snaps to Regions and then you choose what you want to do with the capture there it is the best solution to the tab problem is the arc browser I strongly recommend checking it out it rethinks how we interact with the internet and with information and it's a really nice compliment and it's a part of your personal Knowledge Management System because it creates a new information realm where most everything you've encountered can be found in a way that feels rather orderly it's different it takes some getting used to but I think it's clearly better once you do get used to it it's now my daily personal browser it's hugely impressive and yes it's still in beta somehow even if you'd never try Arc browser I think one day in the future you'll be using some of these features in whatever browser you're using because I suspect the big boys will be stealing them they're just too good thank you so much for your time everyone I look forward to seeing you again and until then stay connected thank you [Music] [Music]
