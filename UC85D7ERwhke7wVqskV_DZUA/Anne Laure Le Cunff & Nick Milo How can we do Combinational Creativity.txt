i have to introduce someone that i'm just so excited to talk with and that i have the the honor to be here with and that's and laura lacombe who is the founder of nest labs a community of knowledge workers to be more productive and creative while taking care of their mental health she's an ex-googler and holds an msc in neuroscience from king's college london and her work has been featured in wired rolling stone and at this point countless more very excited to say hello to you and laura and just before turning the mic over to you i want to say that it's just been a real joy to find your voice in the world of creativity and personal knowledge management your articles your your vibe and the people that you've brought into your community has just been amazing so it's just a real pleasure to be talking with you now so hello how are you i'm good thank you so much for having me i am very grateful for our little corner of the internet and i know we have a little bit of overlap in our community so it's really nice that we get to chat today yeah yeah it really is and so what we just did in the prior session for those who attended is something about how to take or make notes during these events and so i do know that one thing we're going to be talking about and maybe you want to kick this well we'll get there soon but they made a note most likely on combinational creativity very interesting words and i want to explore that with you so before we dive in though i just i'm curious why like how did this all come to be why did you just a little background why do you find yourself here like what was that moment where you kind of went from i thought my life was going to go this direction and now i'm here like you said beforehand often speaking in english that was you weren't always sure that you'd be doing that so how did we get here or what stands out to you yes i started with a very conventional career i went to prep school business school started working at google in tech my parents were very happy it all felt really safe and then at some point i realized that this wasn't for me that i didn't feel like i had the space that i needed to express my creativity to follow my cursity and that knowing exactly where the path was taking me didn't feel exciting enough so i started from scratch and i went back to school at the ripe age of 28 to study in neuroscience and this is what put me on this path really because during my studies i discovered something called degeneration effect that shows that by generating your own version of any kind of contents that you are studying you're both going to remember it better but also understand it better so i started a little newsletter where every week i would write about what i was learning and sharing it with i was going to say the world but really it was maybe my brother my sister maybe a couple of former colleagues at the time but it was an amazing outlet for me to start writing online and since then that newsletter has grown quite a bit i have started a private community and it has become nas labs which is kind of the the way i make a living today so this is my journey so far wow that's amazing and actually today i was reopening the generational effect the generation effect so was that really early on in your process and was that one of those major sparks it sounds like you're saying it was just that idea oh absolutely there's been a before and after time after i've discovered that concept because before that i started for quite a few months and i was just studying the way i've always been taught to study just learning everything by heart and trying to regurgitate everything during the exams and promptly going on forgetting everything and moving on to the next thing and when i discovered the generation effect i realized that i could actually use all of this knowledge that i was taking all of this time and energy interacting with and make it more useful for me over the long term and that it does sound obvious and i think for many people in your community that are listening right now maybe this is an obvious thing but there's more to life than taking exams so the generation effect for me was um a pivotal moment where i realized that i could also create something of my own and put it into the world and that's when i started creating and sharing my work online yeah we're going to move on to the combinational creativity because but but i say this with the grin because i just want to talk about how profound the generation effect is and in fact that that's a really good opportunity to make a note on that as well everyone because i think you'll find that it might tie into it might link into combinational creativity it's just a hunch i don't know for sure we're about to find out but i mean that that's i just get goosebumps because the idea that you can learn by by chewing on concepts by colliding them by i don't know maybe getting them to combine in interesting ways it's just exciting but with that in mind let's go to the topic what is combinational creativity well i just love how you just linked it's very meta but how you just linked the generation effect to combinational creativity because there is actually a link um so i think a good way to understand what combinational creativity is is to look at the kind of traditional definition of creativity a lot of people think that creativity is basically this idea of having a muse that comes and whispers in your ear ideas and gives you inspiration and this is a very old idea because you can go back to the work of ancient authors and poets and artists and so many of them were complaining about the fact that their muse are silent has abandoned them and that they have no ideas their creativity is gone and a lot of them in fact were using chemical substances opium alcohol whatever it took to get them used to come back the good news for everyone listening who wants to be more creative without having to consume any opium is that you this is not how creativity works and all creativity is combinational in nature there's no something that just materializes from thin air any kind of creativity in essence is taking two or more things that already exist and combining them together to create something new and so this is really what combinational creativity is um so what's really nice about it is that it means that it can be controlled it can be programmed and this is something that you can do regularly you can literally sit down and practice it instead of waiting for your muse to come and whisper those ideas into your ear yes and i guess the question with that would be how does this concept how should it make us feel this idea that we combine things and we don't have to wait for the muse like with the people in your community and when you've shared this and with yourself what what when we understand that we're combining and not trying to create from the magical nothingness how what's the feeling that that gives off to you um i actually got an email from a community member a few days ago that is the answer to your question but she was telling me that the idea of combinational creativity gave her permission to create and share her work because it made her realize that no idea was original and that was a big um barrier for her that every time she was creating something she felt like oh someone else has created something similar at some point it's not original it's not new and so it's worthless and realizing that all creativity all ideas are just a combination of existing ideas gave her permission to kind of join that collective playground where everyone is taking ideas from other people combining them together and then contributing their new ideas back to the pull that everyone can pull from and connect again together so in terms of how it makes us feel i think that compared to the traditional idea of creativity which is basically passive unpredictable and very stressful because you have no control over it and you keep on judging yourself for not being original enough combination of creativity is active it's more mindful and it's also a lot more playful playful seems to be the key word there and a playground it's like we're a child jumping back into the sandbox and there are some other kids in there we're all waddling around and we we learn and we play i love that so those are some of the benefits so far of combinational creativity a playful attitude the site understanding that we have permission to combine it makes me think just as a tangent and you probably know about this and i i don't and i should where did this i don't know if you have an answer here so i don't want to put you on the spot but does anyone know or do you know where this notion came from that we have to be these original artists the the these original uh i think okay don't quote me exactly on this but i think it comes from ancient greece and from the actual muses like they actually had those deities that were uh kind of the the guardians of of creativity and of ideas and and i think the that's why the poets in ancient greece were considered a separate class of citizens because they were the only ones that had that privilege of connecting with the muses and hearing from them which would explain also why they were in such despair when their creativity was gone because it did mean that they had been abandoned by their news um but i think this is where it comes from wow i whether or not that that's the case i i i think that makes a lot of sense that it is in that sense that if it's gone it's just so fragile i guess you know when you think of it that way versus combining because now we have building blocks they're always around and it's just let's dump them on the floor again and see what we can do i think i think there's more i think there's more to suss out here i guess my next question would be around practical ways that you've found to do combinational creativity where is it happening or how is it practical yeah um well you need to start with at least two ideas obviously if you want to combine something together it could be more ideas but i'll start with the two ideas just to make it simple and practical um there are three main ways that i've found are really helpful to get started with combinational creativity so the first one would be chaining ideas so you take them you take those two ideas and you ask yourself how does this first idea impact the other one um to give you an example i write a lot about mindful productivity and i've started recently again doing intermittent fasting and so chaining would be how does mindful productivity impact fasting for example how do you combine the two how do you maybe build a mindful productivity schedule and a way of working that allows for you to also better manage your diet et cetera so how does a impact be and you could do that for absolutely anything and it doesn't have to be linear it could be how does mindful productivity impact your diet and your sleep for example or how does mindful productivity impact your sleep and how does sleep impact your mental health and you can go in all sorts of directions like this by combining those ideas and building a little chain basically um until you start discovering interesting questions and stories that you want to explore further um another one that um works really well is clustering so instead of just chaining them like this in terms of which how does they do they impact each other it's looking at what they have uh in common the common themes that they have together and those are some of the the most fun ones that you can come up with like um what do creativity and mental health have in common what do um cities and living organisms have in common what do gardening and project management have in common so you can take two ideas and the talking about playfulness but the the more random they are and the more different they seem the more fun this exercise is to try and find the common points between the two and the more random and again there's no real originality but the more random they are the more likely you are to stumble upon something that very few other people have been looking at before which can be really fun as well and the last one is comparing and contrasting ideas and just asking yourself how are they similar how are they different is one better than the other um so yeah there's a book i really like i highly recommend called the hidden life of trees and it's the the author i can't remember his name but um he's the one who coined the term wood wide web the idea that all of the plants and and trees and uh and fungi they're all connected together they communicate together the decent signals and messages and collaborate together and so the way they approach that problem was taking the idea of animal intelligence and planned intelligence how are they similar how are they different if you take an animal brain what does that look like for a plant uh if you look at fear the emotion of fear in an animal what does it look like in a plant then just comparing and contrast trusting like this those ideas across two different domains is also an amazing way to come up with new ideas so those are my three main techniques and to bring them all together um something i really like to do is build a concept map which maybe some of your audience are already familiar with but if you're not it's a bit like a mind map where you're putting um different ideas on paper and linking them together what's different about a concept map is that you actually define what the links are about so this arrow in this direction means that this idea is impacting this one in this way this arrow in this one means that this one is stronger than this way and you just write it down and it's a really nice way to chain and and cluster compare and contrast your ideas on paper and kind of see patterns emerge in this way love the concept map and when you have to define the relationship that is again being active in the process and that's helping to make better sense of things so it seems as though you are a fan of words that start with c you've got combinational creativity and then the three c's right i'm sure you're quite aware of this uh chaining clustering comparing contrasting um and they're all just amazing uh the chaining i i did not include that sort of question in our note making efforts but i'm going to implore everyone listening to add this question how does the thing that was interesting impact the thing it reminds you of how does a impact be so we're going to add that prompt that's our sixth prompt okay good one here would be how does combinational creativity or how does this generation effect impact combinational creativity or the other way around i don't know just throwing out ideas keeping everyone on their toes did you ever get into cmap tools it was this open source concept map are you aware of it i'm aware of it i've never used it because by the time i discovered it there were a lot more more modern tools that were doing similar things yeah i don't know if they were better because i can't really compare to i haven't used that but i've seen the landing page and it looked like it hadn't been updated in a very long time so i just assumed which i can't blame anyone for because i know what it's like in open source work and can be a bit of a thankless um you know task to maintain all of these things um but yeah so i've never used it i'm familiar with it yeah uh it's it's really amazing how long it took to kind of improve upon that that the one thing that i had going for it was that it was basically an open canvas so like you were saying the mind map can be it the concept map is separate but one of the reasons that cmap tools was so nice is because it was open so you could just manually drag things wherever you wanted to and you didn't feel constrained and that was that was enjoyable i think we've we have better apps these days but it took a lot longer than it should have to get there from my opinion and and that i think ties in overall to something that i think we're not completely there yet which is the visuals so we have all these ideas and a lot of them are still text based i mean i'm in obsidian every day and that's 90 text so how can we use combinational creativity in a more visual way we have the the concept map that's probably the main one but are there others that you've seen so i would say that the concept map would be probably the most effective one simplest one as well because you could use tools like cmap but and there are many many other tools if you just look it up but uh you can also do it on paper it doesn't require any complicated tools to actually do it a pen and a piece of paper you could be on the bus on the plane or wherever and just pull your notebook and very quickly start mapping a concept and combining ideas together to do a mini brainstorm on your own that's very easy um one of my friends who wrote a book she did it uh with post-it notes on her wall uh and it uh it looks really nice too it looks a little bit crazy a little bit like in in those um murder movies kind of scene where the detective is trying to find out who committed the crime but um she basically has a white board and she put the post-it notes on them and then she links the positive notes by just writing on the whiteboard and she can just erase the lines when she wants to move stuff around she can just kind of pull post-it notes together that allows her also to play with different colors for different themes something that i really like that she did was that she had a color coding for the level of certainty that she had around the ideas so ideas that she was very confident about that she had lots of knowledge about and so that she was almost 100 sure we're going to end up somewhere in the book she those would have a certain color and then some that were more like questions things that she's heard in the conversation but maybe didn't have time to do her own research about wasn't completely sure about and where wasn't sure they would end up in in the book where on a different posted notes in terms of color and she could rewrite them on another color depending on how she felt about them but i really like that process takes a bit of space uh if you live with other people they may not like the new uh decor that you're putting in the living room but i really like that too but i think yeah and pen paper using uh an online tool your wall um it's really the the the idea is still the same right it's just being able to have those ideas to be able to move them and to link them together uh if your method accomplishes these things it works that really makes me want to have the big white board and do that um i i don't do it often enough i've been whenever things get hectic though i return more to paper than ever usually when i have to like plan big big things then i want to diagram and just have a map of physical map that i can take with me in my hand and work with it how have you used combinational creativity in your work you've done so much uh we probably you could talk about this for a day but what are some that really resonate with you well the the whole theme of my blog nest labs is the result of combinational creativity i basically looked at what happens if you take the best from mindfulness and the best from productivity and you combine them together and that gives you very original meaningful productivity very transparent right but my whole work is based on that and i'm constantly pulling ideas from the world of productivity and from the world of mindfulness and combining them together most of my articles are the result of some sort of combinational creativity exercise and another way that i've been sometimes using concept maps as well to come up with ideas is that there's something really nice when you create those kind of maps where you can visually see the gaps you can visually see where not many people have explored that part of the map and where you want to contribute in filling that gap and so i really like doing that sometimes just taking all of the ideas that i've written about that i've read about i just go through my notes and i just create a little map and i look at the things that have been covered many many times and i look at the areas where it's a bit more empty it's a bit like being an explorer again the idea of the playground and i decide oh great i'm going to go and explore that part of the map because not many people have been there yet exactly and where did that map come from like you made you made the map exactly the the map itself is actually yeah it's actually a producer of combinational a product of of combinational creativity i've never i've done that for some of my maps on twitter but i would imagine it just made me realize that i would imagine that even the maps themselves if you want you wanted to share them with the world could actually be something pretty cool to share with people yeah it's it's you being the cartographer like you figuring out what's on the map um and then there are gaps in your your map and you say okay let's go here yes i think it's a worth worthwhile metaphor sometimes i think the map you know i think everyone here probably has heard the phrase the map is not the territory sometimes i think well it kind of is it kind of is though if it's our reality like if the map is our reality it's it it's yes it's not the territory a rock i can say rock but that's not you know rock i don't want to go too philosophical but sometimes i think the maps we make become our reality yeah i i agree no i agree with you uh i think this is actually a really helpful metaphor uh as long as you remember that your map is not fixed and that you can expand it uh and and in that way your territory uh your own uh you know access to your own territory becomes bigger basically the more you expand that map the more you go and uh you know have fun in this little unexplored areas ask questions uh you know kind of like being comfortable with the unknown and seeing that as an opportunity to create something new in that case it's uh it's good to remember that the map is not the territory but also that it doesn't really matter in practical terms because your map is your current territory and all you can do is expand that map so you can expand your territory yeah that's pretty awesome yeah what about your tools uh what what are the tools physical or digital or apps whatever it is what are the ones that you're using where you're really practicing combinational creativity the most um i would say that it depends on which stage i'm at in the process i uh i very often start from just my note-taking system i do everything in rome there are lots of different tools that achieve similar things and so i think it doesn't really matter which tool you're using though some of them make it easier to link your ideas together this is one of the reasons why i like rome because it makes it very easy to create those links but i kind of do uh my gardening in in rome i'm just looking for ideas connecting them together um and you know looking for inspiration then sometimes i'll switch to paper once i noticed an area that i think is interesting and i'll do a quick concept map doesn't take very long you know maybe like 10 minutes but just to have an idea of what i have in my notes what are those gaps that i want to explore and uh and then i'll go back to rome to do a little outline of the content that i want to create based on the ideas that are found by combining them chaining them etc which happens more in a visual way on paper for me and once i'm ready to actually create the article i leave rome because it's not a really great writing experience and i just go to google docs like most people and and this is where i actually actually write but there's a lot of back and forth it's not a very linear process because sometimes i'll start writing the outline and realize that oh here's a gap i didn't see with the concept map actually so maybe let's go back to this and explore a little bit more or um sometimes i'll have an idea and i'll find that there's everything i need in my note-taking system already because this is something that i've probably been interested in for a long time whereas sometimes it's something very new and i need to do a lot more research so there's this kind of method to the madness but it's i think from the outside it would probably look a little bit messy and but i think i think this is part again of the playfulness of it i don't try to apply a very rigid system to my creative process i really try to make space for ideas to emerge for um for for creativity to happen and uh and i really follow my cursilly this is really the compass that i'm using to decide what i'm going to write about next it's it's really similar because we're uh we we say a lot of the same phrases and when i hear something that you say i think wow wow um it's really in the air it's really in the air it's in the zeitgeist so to speak and it's just cool hearing hearing things like ideas emerge and and then something else though is that the the process because i always think i'll start on paper to get off you know like get out the noise then i'll go digital but you're actually saying well some you know go digital like see things but then i'll take it to paper concept map it and it's not always linear like you said but then then you can go back and then yeah google docs for the final output do you for your newsletters is it do you go on google docs or do you maybe just go right into the uh the newsletter forum for the newsletter my newsletter is uh mostly uh you know kind of like a collection of everything that i've produced that week whether it's articles or tweets or podcasts that i've done so i write it directly in my email service provider i'm using convertkit um and so i write everything in there because the only real bit of writing that i do is just the introduction of the newsletter and that's maybe four or five paragraphs at most and it's mostly about what i've been thinking this week there's no additional research going on there i'm not trying to produce new ideas at the stage of writing the newsletter so if i've had if i've done everything right that week normally it's more of a matter of pulling all of these things that i've created that week and putting them together in the newsletter so i did directly in there i need to get to that point right now i'm doing too much creative work in uh also convertkit and it's not the funnest but they're all that's an another interesting area i'd actually like to explore how the medium the environment affects the message or the content because if if you say something on twitter it's going to look different than when you're writing an article at nest labs absolutely i was actually talking about it on twitter recently how someone was saying that they recently started writing in google docs and they loved it and i was telling i was saying that i i write all of my nest labs articles in google docs but for my phd i have to use microsoft words which is horrendous and it's funny how i feel like it also impacts the way i'm thinking and writing i tend to be more calm in google docs my sentences are shorter uh is is just like less verbose whereas the the environment of words makes me feel like i have to talk like a researcher i have to write long sentences it has to be complicated so it's more effort for me and very often i end up downloading my articles from words uploading them to google docs to do the final editing just to shift that mindset and go into nest labs writing kind of mode and then obviously for for twitter just because you have those restrictions in terms of length of the content the fact that if you want to write longer things you have to break it down into discrete units of ideas like if you do a thread each tweet has to encompass one idea that also makes you probably think in a more bite-sized structured way um so this is yeah this is why i would probably see a difference between people i know some people write their threads outside of twitter and just copy paste them afterwards whereas others write directly on twitter and i don't know what the effect is but i wouldn't be surprised if there's a difference in tone and the way those tweets are presented in the end depending on where the tweets were actually crafted yeah there definitely would be i'm absolutely sure of it if it's in twitter it's going to be punchier shorter more uh like declarative and then if it's if it was done in a journal if you're writing in cursive i don't think you're going to be making the same statements and exclamation points and that sort of thing uh so just couple more questions and i think we'll open it up in a few minutes to the questions and then we'll be done everyone in about i can't believe it 16 minutes that's all we have so we'll be done at the 50-minute mark 50-minute mark um so a couple i have two i think two more questions i wanted to get to is what can you do with ideas that you generate through combinational creativity and you've probably already you know they do become outputs but is that what you're doing mostly like outputting them sharing them or how would you describe your the ideas that you create through combinational creativity which is probably everything but yeah um yeah obviously in my case the most obvious outcome is all of the articles that i'm creating um i i used to publish youtube videos as well which i'm not doing anymore because i had to sacrifice some things when i started the phd can't do everything but i was also using that for youtube videos um tweets but also even if you don't have a blog even if you don't have a newsletter or podcast or an active twitter account you can use the ideas that you've generated with combinational creativity in all sorts of different areas of your life and your work so you can use them in conversations you'll find that the more you connect ideas together the more you'll also kind of like use that muscle and when you talk with people and they say something you'll be like oh that reminds me of this because you're so used to looking at the world in this way now where you're constantly chaining and clustering and comparing ideas that this is going to hap naturally happen during conversations so one outcome is that you're going to be a lot more fun at dinner parties which is great uh and then um another one is is just at work it may not be especially in the online creator world one of the most obvious things because many of us don't really do these things anymore but um if you're putting a presentation together at work you can come up with a new interesting angle a new way to look at a problem a solution that is more innovative because you combine two ideas that were not the obvious ones that everyone was looking at so that can also be used when you're solving for problems at work or even on personal projects it's it's really just a great way to think about ideas in general and ideas are not only in the realm of online you know the online creator world they're everywhere right so every anywhere you think ideas are helpful combinational creativity can be helpful and that kind of segues into this last one is it doesn't sound like this is something that has to be done by yourself oh definitely not it's you can do it on your own it works on your own and and if you if you don't feel like you have yet a community to do that with you can start on your own but it's even more fun when you do it with other people and it can be on twitter just sharing those ideas that you're generating or even asking people saying what do you think happens if you combine this and this or how do you think this idea impacts this other one so you can even collect answers from other people rather than just working with your own or you know in communities i know you know in your community nick uh for example like lots of people who are passionate about linking their thinking so trying to find a little tribe or at least one thinking body that you can bounce ideas up with can be a really really good way to increase even more the power of combinational creativity because it's again all about combining them together so the more ideas you have in that playground the more ideas you can play with the more creative you're going to be yeah i love that and that kind of is what we're all doing here so all all 263 of us we're right now forming a sort of um pressure cooker an environment where we can a fun pressure cooker a playful pressure cooker but it's concentrated and that's actually a really important component to a lot of the creativity if if our ideas are spread out and it takes us two miles to get to the next one we're not going to be able to make a connection as easily between them but if they're in this on the same concept map then then sparks can fly and and i and i hope that this has provided that environment for for everyone listening it has for me for sure like you know my the mind's on fire making all sorts of connections and just really good stuff i think we should open up for q a if you're down for that and laura we have 10 minutes let's do it all right so here's one and i i'm happy to see that rodney's already responded but what is the generation effect in one or two sentences go write me you even link to the netslib's article thank you so much um so yeah it's uh it's basically uh as i said beginning really the idea that by creating your own version of a piece of content you're going to remember it and understand it better and by creating your own version it can really be as simple when you're taking notes uh to not just write whatever you just heard like whether it's you're taking an online course or you're having a conversation or you read something interesting just rephrase it in your own words and that would be really the simplest version of this and then you can take it to another level which is what i did with creating full blog posts about ideas in my own words again videos podcasts whatever you generate basically is going to help you remember and understand the content better that's the generation effect wonderful wonderful all right let's see lolita how would you take into account acknowledging the source of an idea when creating your own aka not risking plagiarism when in the process of putting things in your own words or creating your own idea thanks uh it's fine it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by william inch he's an english writer and he said that originality is undetected plagiarism so this is i think uh really the only way to to do this um is just to kind of link to the original ideas and you'll see that if you go on my blog and any kind of uh blog writer or content creator that's honest about the fact that their creativity is combinational is going to have references to where they found the inspiration and it's amazing when you read that kind of content because it's like breadcrumbs you can click on the links and see oh that idea came from here oh but that idea is also the result of the combination of two other ideas and it's a little bit like falling into a wikipedia black hole you just find like fall into that black hole of combinational creativity where you see how other people have connected these ideas together so if you want to join in on the fun and be connected again in that big playground just make sure that you link back to the authors that have contributed ideas that you've used and combined together to create your own content yeah i think that's that's really important to think of it in that way i it i wrote down something that you said there and i think i would i want to add this to my permissions list i keep a list of permissions to kind of push back against some things that society makes us think but this one that you said it's okay or basically to rephrase it it's okay that your creativity is combinational like it's okay exactly this is really good yes uh i'll uh yeah i'll i've probably replied that to the email that i got from my community member that was talking about the same word that she usually just used right it gave me permission combinational creativity gave me permission to create and share my work yes absolutely all right so i'm sifting through got some shout outs that uh gray really enjoys your newsletter one of the highlights of the week thank you tomas says i feel this strongly and love this fusion combinational creativity in food and in cultures have produced some of the beautiful things in the world both biological and the combination of genes artistic scientific etc kids are naturally playful and without limits combined things that adults would sometimes would never think of i love this less of it cool yeah less of a question but more of a vibe yeah yeah no play off of it please oh no no i i i love this and and actually i i think this is rena it doesn't mean that because something is natural it's good but in this case you do find that combinational creativity is something that you find everywhere in nature as well and i absolutely agree with you um some of my favorite restaurants are also fusion food restaurants uh you i think about my favorite artist like i really like stromae for example and his songs are talking about depression with some very densely vibes and it's taking those two things that would normally feel really work together but they work because he just went ahead didn't wait for permission and combine them together so i absolutely agree and you talked about science too i do think that a lot more discoveries would happen if scientists were not working as much in silos and if there was a lot more collaboration between different disciplines and if we were taking inspiration from different areas of research combining them together and see what lies when you look at that overlap so yeah i know it wasn't a question but i really like this so thank you for sharing thomas yes we need this though you know i look at the the the odds not the odds but the teens 2010 to 19 however you want to look at it and i really thought uh cal newport's idea of deep work and how we need to honor our attention was sort of the thought of the the decade in many ways i think going into the 20s i know i'm simplifying things going into the 20s though i think it's really ideas around combinational creativity and being able to cross disciplines and genres and our thinking that way because we have systematic problems to solve a yolanda gibb who's speaking later would classify these as wicked problems we're not going to solve them if we're only focused on this particular tiny field we need people who can make the connections who can combine and talk to each other in combinational ways so all of us here have almost responsibility to practice this a couple more and feel free to play off i don't ever mean to jump in um danny hatcher who is speaking on friday what does creativity mean what does it look like feel like how do you identify it this is such a big question i feel like people have spent thousands of years trying to answer that question um i'll i'll give it a try uh i don't pretend this is the definitive answer to such a big question um but to me and sorry if this is going to sound very um philosophical but to me creativity is when i felt most alive in the sense that i'm not just here existing and passively experiencing whatever is going on around me it's when i feel like an like an active maker of the world i feel like i'm shaping the world around me i'm contributing something and the world is slightly different for me being in it versus than me not being in it so it's very philosophical but at its core i think it's about being an actor in the world whatever that looks like to you whatever you create whatever you contribute it's about making and and shaping the world i really like that being an actor once you get off the seat in the stands and jump into the arena then you're being creative final uh thoughts or things um how can we learn more i mean at this point i feel like everyone here probably knows you and more defines your work but what would be some next steps where people can go to next what would you prefer your website um yeah the best way to make me
