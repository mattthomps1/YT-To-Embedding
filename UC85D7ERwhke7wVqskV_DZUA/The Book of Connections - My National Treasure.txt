this is a treasure hunt and i just discovered the book of connections [Music] what is this book and why is it so valuable well if i was nick cage this would be my national treasure its true worth is hard to measure hidden in plain sight it helps you write it's a source of surprising pleasure any ideas it's 168 years old no before the internet this book was the leader in the lynx all right here it is it is peter mark rogers thesaurus thesaurus is latin for treasure treasury or storehouse why is this book so cool if you're like me your early interactions with the thesaurus was probably to write an english paper and you probably think of it on the same level as the dictionary but i hold this one a little bit higher and i'll tell you kind of how i use it for fun now if you can believe that so we're inundated with so much noise and notification and distractions and we're kind of wired now to want this newness this novelty so we go online and we check out the news or we check out whatever social media sites we're using but sometimes you want to break from that and this is the break you can get the same novelty dopamine hit but now it's a lot more productive to be honest so let me share with you a fun way to use the thesaurus let's imagine you're just saying the same word way too often so four years ago for me that word was perplexing that's a perplexing situation hmm perplexing i don't know i'd kind of say it with a with a grin on my face but now at that point i realized i need to kind of spice things up so i went to perplexing adjective difficult to understand and then it gives me the list baffling beyond one complicated confusing convoluted disconcerting impenetrable intricate involves naughty mind-bending mysterious mystifying paradoxical puzzling taxing thorny worrying so just reading off all of these words i i get this kind of rush of excitement i mean now we're calling it like a rush of dopamine and i didn't have to go online to look at news or anything because now it's kind of activated my brain and in some ways it's better than coffee and this is one of those profound things but words words are ideas and if you have a broader availability of words at your disposal ideas come so much more rapidly come so much more organically okay so that's what i would do i'd pick a word and i say instead of perplexing let me try to use disconcerting and mystifying you know like that but here's the specific value of this version of the treasury and that is the concept index so this is the 21st century thesaurus and is the updated third edition so the main editor of this is barbara ann kitfer phd head lexiconographer and she as far as i know developed this really awesome concept index at the back of this book and so for every word there is a number next to that word so for perplexing the number was 529 so i go to the back i go to this concept index which is so cool and it kind of has like a table of contents so i go to the 520s and i see it's qualities and it says abstract so i'm going to go dig down drill down to that almost there qualities abstract it was 529 that gives me cognitive all right so now this long list of all of these that's right right in this section all of these words that are related to abstract qualities that are of a cognitive flavor so you know after perplexing we have pitiful preference premonition problematic provocative questionable radical ravishing and then the list just goes on so let's say you're on this little bunny trail and then you go down the rabbit hole because you want to go to a radical now and you want to see what radical has to say so i mean how much healthier does this feel than going online and checking out the latest news stories and news articles you know let's give the thesaurus a second chance because it's really valuable and it's a way to link your thinking so whenever you're stuck whenever you just want something different don't reach for your phone reach for the book of connections it's pretty awesome hey so i hope you liked this video it's a little different than the ones i've done in the past so if you do like it let me know with a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already and i can make sure to do more versions like this there are so many books to cover i think the one that i have in mind for the upcoming linking your thinking workshop that's kind of my capstone project is going to be daring greatly by brene brown and what's so cool about this book is i read it with my girlfriend when we were long distance this was several years ago we're still together and what we would do is narrate each chapter to each other we learned so much from this book you know i have so many underlines and highlights and comments but i've never really processed it i kind of want to connect what's in here and what's in here with everything that i have in my digital library to strengthen those connections because this is one of those meaningful books you don't do it with everything but i think it's valuable to do it for the meaningful stuff so for the workshop everyone takes on like the big project it might be work related who knows but for me i really want to pick apart this book and then hopefully have a good example of how you can really look at your favorite books outline them pull out the concepts relate those concepts to other things and then from that if you want create articles blogs produce things but even if you don't produce anything you're just more enriched from the process and as i've said before it just makes every conversation you enter that much more engaging and fun really and uh i don't know it's hard to put a price on that anyways hope you enjoyed more to come thank you [Music] [Music] you
