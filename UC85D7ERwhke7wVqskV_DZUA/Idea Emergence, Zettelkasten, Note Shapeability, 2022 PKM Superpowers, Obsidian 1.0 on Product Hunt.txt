hello and welcome to the first letters from the ideaverse it's an experiment it's a video talking about the newsletter that we put out with linking your thinking it's going to go deeper in some areas of the newsletter and yet in other areas you will only find it in the newsletter so let's give this a go I'm going to start from the top this is about idea emergence zettel Caston no shapeability some really interesting 2022 PKM superpower results as well so let's dive into it the first thing is do you fully grasp the power of this thing this thing called idea emergence it underpins all of our greatest ideas how from the nothingness we say hey that that means something to us let me make note of that let me externalize it on a piece of paper on a napkin on a digital note and over time if I can work with it the right way it can start interacting with other ideas and through that process we're looking at this definition those interactions through that all those interactions the colliding the combination of things something can emerge that is more than the sum of their parts this is both valuable and personally meaningful so I encourage you to read through idea emergence and try to grock it better than you currently do another way to look at it is that there are existing things out there in the world with idea emergence what we want to do is connect those existing things over time with new things experiences ideas conversations through the lens of you and that's where you will find that some of your greatest ideas are emerged from now that might sound really theoretical so let's ground it in something practical so no matter where you are on your knowledge Journey there are three levels where you can take next actions the first is if you're just starting out just link ideas together all these technical things on how ideas emerge we can cover that later the first thing that you have to do though are the fundamentals link ideas together in the world of digital notes that means you take one note and you link it to another note how can you continue well now you want to create a few placeholder notes let's get really really meta here and make a note called idea emergence now whenever it comes up in conversations we can link a new digital note maybe on how Kate Bush's song that was featured in strangers things is a form of idea emergence and we can make a note about that song running up that hill and we can link it to idea emergence with a little note like that then over time this placeholder note idea immersion starts to grow and then one day how can you excel at ID emergence you dust it off and you say to it hey there note today is your day my friend and then you can start mapping your ideas within that note that goes beyond the scope of a simple newsletter but that is the process when you do it beautiful thought collisions happen and nothing shows the nature of collisions in idea emergence better than this simulation of how the moon may have formed so definitely make sure you click on that from the newsletter I don't should I open it up right now I might uh no no I'll leave that to you now we need a much needed and truer history of zetelcaston and thankfully Chris aldricks is the person to provide us that stop reading all those others that'll cast In Articles until you have a broader understanding of the historical perspective of where all this came from I can't tell you how much I learned there was more I didn't know that I than I did know by a by and it wasn't even close so thank you Chris you definitely need to read the two definitions of zettel costume spoiler alert it wasn't started with Luman and he hasn't been the only prolific writer in human history or the only prolific writer in human history that's used as little casting so keep that in mind there are a lot of prolific people out there you don't need to have a a zettel Caston linked system that looks exactly like lumens maybe you want to do that but you don't need to there are so many different ways to be linking your thinking effectively okay and I do have a takeaway here because even throughout all that history and many of the conversations that that I see in different pockets of the the online Arena it still is amazing how little we are grasping of the implication of a digital note why because digital notes are the most shapeable objects ever and you are the person doing the shaping this is a massive massive departure from reading something from let's say Seneca and writing it on an index card and saying that's my quote from Seneca and it is permanent and it is not changing yeah sure you'll still have a few of those notes but what we need to recognize is the power of the shapeability of a note because now it becomes a two-way ongoing conversation and you're using this digital note as a Next Generation thinking tool this isn't note making it's excuse me it's not note taking it is note making so read about this and I invite you to think about the shapeability of digital notes and what that might mean for you from my perspective it is the next great Frontier in notes and those who become comfortable with shapeability are going to find that they have so many opportunities in front of them it might Boggle their mind so here we are this is the first attempt at a letter from the idea verse externalized into a complementary article and a complimentary video which you are watching right here now let's end this with the final section which are the top ranked pcam superpowers of 2022 so now from a list of 60 superpowers I asked people I trust and respect within the link in your thinking community and we will whittled it down to a top 11 superpowers that we want with our knowledge efforts then I opened it up to the newsletter and that was one week ago roughly 600 around 600 votes have come in from various newsletter subscribers now we have the results so the first part of the results are the top three superpowers PKM superpowers for 2022. let's do this in order the number one superpower from the newsletter is to not just consume more stuff but to actually get better at developing the knowledge I already have number two to think better critically creatively connectively and generatively and number three stop losing track of my ideas and feeling overwhelmed with all the information I have to deal with so if you are watching this video this will likely resonate with you because these are the people who have gathered here to learn more about knowledge how we can be better at working with it and these are the top three superpowers from the email newsletter now let's compare this to the linking your thinking Workshop 9 students who recently answered this question because they had a different top three their top three PCM superpowers were to think better okay we had that before but now it's number one and then we have at number two have a system that makes it easy to consistently read write share and teach so it's having a system that's really important for people who decide to jump into the workshop and then at number three learn anything better that means faster more efficiently more deeply so the big takeaway here is that these two areas scored higher for Workshop participants and that tells me that they're ready to prioritize learning better and having a system building that system building that custom Knowledge Management System so as you feel that these are becoming bigger priorities then it's a suggestion that maybe now is the right time for the workshop for you now we're going to try to run this superpower survey annually and I'm very excited to see what great superpowers will emerge in 2023 how will they be worded how will they be phrased what's going to resonate with us and upcoming year so that's exciting now as far as the quick hits those are newsletter only so that's if you want to subscribe you can click on that and then subscribe to the newsletter here other than that and also with the PS there the some of the quick hits cover the recent obsidian 1.0 launch and how it did on product hunt and a book that I read in the fourth grade that has influenced me in profound ways but I completely forgot about until wow decades later I think that's pretty wild anyways I'm curious to get your thoughts on if this video is worth it if me talking through a newsletter going in more depth in some areas but also not covering other areas exclusive to the newsletter I'm curious if this is beneficial to you should I keep doing this or is it just a waste of time let me know in the comments below also like this video too that's another indication that I should keep doing these videos it takes extra effort to make a newsletter to put it on a website and to make a video giving commentary around it is this something you'd like to see more of let me know in the comments below and until next time stay connected
