[Music] welcome to the lighthouse this is kind of a new series where we can actually look at some of the stuff we're talking about which is really helpful for this medium of you know using our computers for personal knowledge management and i'd like to welcome david sparks of the amazing max sparky field guides the focus podcast the mac users uh podcast that self but accurate internet rascal and he's joining me and we're going to chat about obsidian maybe even have a screen share or two and then after that we'll have an ask me anything sort of session with david and see where that takes us we'll try to get you in and out in less than an hour david how are you doing great nick thanks for having me on and i just want to start out by saying what a fan i am of all the stuff you've been doing i think linking your thinking is just an amazing youtube channel and i subscribe and i'm always eager to see what you've what you're cooking up next well hey thank you it's a it's just a work of a work of fashion that kind of developed out of thin air but i'm really really happy to see where it's going and um but yeah i mean it's it's just kind of amazing to be chatting with you some more and you had me on the focus podcast with with mike a few months back and uh you know i just remember you know your name coming up so many years ago and purchasing your omnifocus field guide yeah i think that was in 2016 and it just the list goes on so it's quite an honor to to be having you on board well the feeling is mutual um hey so with that in mind let's kind of hop into things so what i'm hoping for this conversation is that we can kind of just have a bunch of different you know chat so i'm going to do my best to pretend that everyone's not here for now sure and that's just you and me and like i'm gonna start off with the softball though uh would you consider yourself a lifelong geek yeah absolutely absolutely what did i mean where did that come from i don't know it just you know just is you know i mean i remember so i was born in 1968 so i've got a few years under my belt but when i was a kid you know technology was really exploding and you know the original computers were coming out and i was just drinking it up i've told the story in some of my speaking engagements but there was a radio shock about a mile and a half from my house growing up and they had at that time the tandy colored computer which if memory serves i think it had 4k of memory and i you know my parents didn't have any money they weren't going to buy me ex and computers were really expensive back then so i would literally ride my bike to radio shack every day and the guys that work there were really friendly and they they would let me sit at that computer and program it all day i taught myself basic and some of their assembly language and i started writing programs and games and then you'd save them to cassette tape you know because that was the the means of saving back then and then they would use them to sell the computers when people would come in to buy a computer they'd load up one of my programs and show it to the customer so it was kind of a mutually beneficial relationship but for several years the orange 10 speed was parked outside of radio shack like a full-time job so were you were you learning actually in radio shack yes on the devices yes i don't know why they put up with me but they did and it was great i could see that being a lot of fun though i mean yeah you have a kid coming coming in yeah really enthusiastic and eventually i got my hands on a real computer and and you know just kind of went from there i so i i really learned it at the command line but um when the first mac came out and i sat behind the first mac it was so obvious that this was where it needed to go the graphical user interface and i just loved everything about apple but those computers also were very expensive back in the day but i've had this like kind of lifelong love affair with apple's aesthetic and their their attention to detail with their systems and it's kind of led me down this road that in addition to being a lawyer i'm also this this this internet nerd yeah yeah absolutely my next kind of question for you is when was your first computer and what was it um well i i guess i'd argue it was that tandy color computer that didn't belong to me as much time as i logged on it um but i uh i think uh i think i got an atari it was a it was an atari i think 400. i it was the one with the worst keyboard that's ever been put on a computer um it had a membrane it didn't actually have keys and you'd have to press really hard and uh and at some point the switches would wear out you'd have to take a pencil and like job really hard on the keys to get them and i was programming once again i was always programming games and stuff i couldn't wait to you know get my hands in just the idea that i would do something with code and then something on the screen would change was was amazing to me uh eventually i got into an apple ii um i was not early on the macintosh bandwagon just because they were really expensive and i didn't have any money but um i by the time i went to to university it was um so it was right around the time that the mac came out and they had them at school so once again the computer lab i would just camp out there and then actually got a job at school that they gave me a mac so i used a mac for a long time then it took it took me a while to buy a mac because i just couldn't couldn't afford it that's true yeah and then so i guess before we get into the screen share because i definitely know you have a few cool things to screen share but then how did that transition eventually into mac power users and what is the origin story of mac power users yeah mac power users is just it's just a podcast i katie floyd and i uh were friends and we were talking about making a podcast and i didn't want to make one unless we could bring something to the table that was different than everything else and at that time this is like 2006 into 2007. uh most of the mac their apple podcasts were very news focused you know it's like you know what you know what are they gonna do next you know what's steve jobs up to this week and all that stuff and i didn't really care about that stuff i really wanted a high signal to noise podcast where you could learn about how to do something better and you know i want it the the term mac power users is aspirational i mean i want listeners to come on to the show saying hey i'd like to be a mac power user and listen and become more of a mac power user and the um the whole idea from the show from the get-go was we're going to pick one subject each week and we're going to dive deep on it or we're going to bring in a guest who dives deep on something and get his or her story for the audience and and katie you know katie my co-host at the time joked with me she's like we're only going to get 10 episodes out of this show because we're going to run out of stuff and i felt like that's fine you know if we only get 10 episodes so long as there are 10 great episodes and now we're we just rounded the corner on episode 600 so we had more than katie thought but the uh so it's kind of you know the idea was to make something that would give a listener a lot of good information you know in a short amount of time i mean my my real goal with that show is anybody who listens to it learns at least one thing they can use in every episode and uh that's how i measure success you know when i hear from a listener who says oh i always get something good out of it i feel like i'm doing a good job if people feel like they're not getting enough out of it if we ever hit the day that people just consistently tell me they're not learning anything new i'm gonna shut it down you know so um but so far we're doing good well that's one of the things that i definitely appreciate about you among other things of course but it's just your clarity that you bring to things like okay if one person gets something out of this one like if somebody gets one thing out of this and that's worth it and uh that's such a good mentality to have and i really appreciate that on that point what what do you have to share in obsidian uh i mean i was hoping you'd ask that yeah so i you know i've been like a lot of people um i've been playing with note-taking systems for years and i couldn't get it right you know and then a tipping point for me was kind of the explosion of rome research and i liked a lot of things about rome but i also didn't like a lot of things for me because i want to use this to work on my law practice and uh you know they don't i don't want to put my data in somebody else's cloud bottom line and and you know the it's just there's a security issue because for me to get the most out of it i need to really be able to dive into it so um and then i was watching obsidian my first couple attempts at this obsidian and that was i want to say maybe um um you know when did they release the first beta yeah i had to ask them because but i guess i was only 11 days after they had and it was in february or march of 2020. so it hit my radar about june and i tried it and i wasn't satisfied with it i mean at that point it was very bare bones and then i um i came back a couple times and then uh in late september uh i was still kind of struggling to find a good solution and there are a lot of good solutions out there i mean craft is another excellent solution for this these types of problems um but but this one in late september i downloaded installed it started putting plugs in and it super resonated with me and i went all in late september of last year and uh i have um i have been you know i'm i'm in now i'm just gonna be an obsidian user i mean uh i i do because of mac car users i need to try out a lot of stuff and a good example for me is task managers i'm super in omnifocus and i was there when they were first designing the app and i was actually and um and i'm always trying a new thing so you know i just got an email from a listener today talking about amazing marvin i said i tried it for a month and i think it's really good but it doesn't give me what i get with omnifocus and so if um i guess if somebody came out with something better i would switch but they haven't and i feel like obsidian kind of fits in that same category where i expect to be using this app for years which is kind of shocking to me because i am not a fan of ugly applications and there's a good argument to make that anything built with electron on the mac is ugly you know um you know i have all these great apple scripts and things i've built for text actions and they don't work because this is an electron app um you know it's just it's just a different beast but when you take this idea of let's put super powers on top of a folder of markdown folders or markdown files and let's add end-to-end encryption that is like an irresistible combination to me and um so i've i've just really just kind of fallen in love with this app but this is my library if you'd like you want me to give you an overview what do you want to talk about should we start with um maybe your organization on the left and then maybe take us eventually into daily notes or something okay um i uh i think that i am not when i watch your videos and i see how shallow a lot of the setups are people are using i feel like i'm doing it wrong but i actually go really deep with folder structure and obsidian and part of the reason is it's my escape hatch you know if for some reason obsidian broke i've got this nested group of markdown folders that i could do anything with and i like that also in the early days before they had an obsidian mobile app i was playing with some of the third-party text editors and if you didn't have your files in a folder structure it was really difficult to get to them and i have a lot of files in my database i think it's over 1500 now um the uh so i have structure um and just kind of the root level daily is all the daily stuff you know and that's daily notes and i create subfolders for each month so i can kind of just keep track of everything um dlr is a project i'm doing with my wife it's the disneyland resort field guide and that's just a youtube channel we made just because our kids are getting older and we want to have some fun and i'm taking some notes in there this one ideas i like this one um because there's a lot of concepts and kind of the root of my whole database is what i call sparky os and i have an operating system for myself i mean as dumb as that sounds um i feel like you know a lot of things that are important to me uh are floating around my brain if i write them down they suddenly become real and it allows me to examine them um i don't know if you've ever read the harry potter series but there's a great tool that dumbledore has called the pensive where he can pull thoughts out of his brain and he can put him into a bowl and then he can examine them from different directions and in a lot of ways this this obsidian is my pensive so uh when i'm thinking about well how do i really think about meditation i'll start writing down i'll put research notes and and my own thoughts as i go into it and then i'll have a note on that that grows into something else over time and uh and that all sources out of the sparky os and so if you look here there's i mean here let me put it and i almost always am in edit mode i really am in in the preview mode but you know i've got all these different topics here and i don't really want to kind of get into all of them on the internet but you know there's a lot of stuff in here and um as things occur to me i'll create new ones and this is this kind of ongoing development of my personal operating system and then the other thing when i've talked about this on the focus podcast is to me the fundamental building block of my life are my roles it's not a project or a goal it's actually i'm a husband father brother uncle friend i'm a learner a human you know and i and i just define those roles and i've got a bunch of pages and research and thoughts based on each one of those and those are also part of the sparky os so this is always at root level for me and um and that gets me into a lot of things but this leads to ideas and getting back to where i was you know so i've got all these before before you jump into ideas because i just think the sparky os thing is is so cool and and seeing yeah you know like the main page of how you set this up is is always the the moment where i'm like oh okay what's david using here and uh padawan learner i love it um could you uh scroll one more time i'm curious how you organize you've got health philosophy spirituality ethics humanity learning productivity relationships it's always interesting just to understand how we categorize this stuff uh creation consumption and this i did not sit down one day and build this you know soup to nuts this is an evolution and my whole experience with obsidian has i never at no point did i just dump in a ton of data um and it's just it's growing over time this started in september and this is where it is now i believe if you come back to me in six months this is gonna look different than it does now you know and um but this is kind of i i have this in front of me all day and i i um you know like i said i'm always diving into the pensive on whatever issue that is on my mind and that's a perfect metaphor too by the way i love it yeah thanks just occurred to me as i was talking i wish i could say i'd plan that okay yeah so i mean to your your point david is that it's like no it would make no sense at all for me to copy and paste exactly what i see on screen but i love you know love the idea of the roles at the top and then how you know you keep these these handy topics these topics so handy to you if they mean yeah yeah and then the other thing in obsidian i i think maybe the most underrated shortcut and obsidian is commando because you just type that in and then type any little bit of any note title and it shows up and your one you know carriage return away from being in the note and um i know that's silly and basic and everybody probably knows that that uses obsidian but i mean i use that many many times a day it's not silly it's kind of perfect because yeah left hand right hand both on the keyboard commando yeah start type i mean it's really magical yeah and that's one of the hidden powers of these apps these that are out the tools for thought is just autocomplete how powerful autocomplete is yeah yeah exactly not not only with the finding but even just creating the links and things like that yeah all right so now over on the left on the left here right so i have this thing category this folder i call ideas parentheses for now and i just like to remind myself that nothing in here is in concrete or carved in stone and i have absolute ability to go in and change my mind about things and that's just kind of a little reminder and it makes me smile when i see that you know that you know whenever i get to the point where i feel like i know it all then i know i'm in trouble and so i i like this is a little humble reminder to myself these are just ideas for now and these are all just various notes on things that i've been putting together and i've started actually organizing those into subfolders but this is like i say a work in progress and i still have have work to do on it but just to give you an idea one that i i feel comfortable sharing i have one here um uh is this interstitial journaling which is a little rabbit hole i went down recently um the idea of journaling throughout the day and um you know what are the benefits i've been just kind of writing down what i've been doing and just as thoughts occurred to me with it i've been keeping track and then i found a couple articles uh at nest labs and a couple videos about it that i watched and then those go back to like media resource notes um let's see what this gets me yeah this is a youtube video by dan silvestri that i found at some point back in june and just kind of i made some notes while i was watching it but you know these i this is an example of just one of the little notes that i have in the ideas and i imagine if anyone i'm curious your thoughts on the interstitial journaling because you do so much of it as a lawyer when you're logging notes for each client so how is how are you taken to just this interstitial personal journaling side of things um you know one of the things that's funny is i did journal you know there's a honeymoon phase with obsidian where you want to turn it into the everything app and i think that's a mistake ultimately um there are very good apps that do things better than obsidian but obsidian is very good at what it does and um when i first started using it you know because i have historically did my journal in a paper notebook with a pin and there's just something about the practice of sitting down especially for someone who spends as much time looking at ones and zeros as i do to you know have a minute to get a pin out and and you know the slowness of writing actually i think helps you think more but i for several months i tried to do it in obsidian and that's when i was really exploring interstitial journaling where i could just hit a time stamp and just logged the whole day as i went through it at the end of the day i felt like it was more trouble that was worth because you know i don't need to know at 10 o'clock i worked on the smith project you know it doesn't doesn't matter that much and uh but what i do in turn what i did take away from it is my paper journal now i don't wait till the end of the data journal if if i'm feeling something that i want to think about or write about i'll i will put in a handwritten timestamp you know 10 you know colon zero zero and then i'll write some stuff underneath it and then so i will timestamp by hand as i write in my journal and uh that so that's what i took away from so i'm using it a little bit but not as much as as i thought i would when i started you know researching it interesting yeah very cool so where does that take us ideas for now yeah inbox is just um that is uh right now i don't think there's a whole lot in it i've just got a couple things here but the um sometimes i just don't have time to process something like i'll take some notes you know after talking to a client or watch a youtube video and learn something from i'm not sure where it fits i'll put it in inbox and then every weekend i clear out all my inboxes and this is one of them so that's just you know a processing box uh max sparky is like the mother lode for max sparky you know all the stuff i do um apple events notes active projects all the blog stuff so like i have posts that i'm cooking these are posts that i'm actively writing these are future ideas these are archives posts i write about jazz music post ideas and sponsors and so i i just have a whole bunch of stuff in here for the blog i have i'm in a um a it's called we call the creators guild it's a group of friends that make things for the internet and we meet and i take notes from those meetings field guides are exactly what it sounds like i make all the field guides so i have a bunch of notes related to that i even have stuff in here about my hardware you know like what's the serial number and what's the repair history of this computer these are ideas i'm developing newsletters i'm writing podcasts i'm making screencast projects i do software notes this is i have a company that so i've got notes on the company speaking gigs sponsors and youtube stuff so i've just got all this stuff kind of organized in here and that this is where i feel like i'm a fraud on obsidian because i know everybody's very shallow and they've just got deep thoughts in it but i also use obsidian to uh you know to track notes and ideas and and um you know just keep track of information it is a personal acknowledgement manager in addition to idea development for me absolutely and and um i think part of that is you know when um this is my opinion on all that but yeah when rome came out and added a lot of um well it doesn't have folders naturally in any way yeah so then it was kind of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater but folders still play a very huge role and for some people even more than for other people obviously you're using them a lot but we can see that it's pretty effective for and obviously it's working for you and that's first and foremost but um yeah i i definitely don't want to be like caught up in that idea of working with knowledge with the hand tied behind your back it's like no use the folders like that's another hand that you have at your your disposal in general people who are enthusiastic about something like this um there are different ways to use it and you shouldn't get hung up on it you know i mean if you want to have like your system is remarkable i've downloaded your link in your thinking database and i mean the the thought you put into it is remarkable but i i just it didn't really work with me um i was reading about how like magicians like are so like all magicians seem to hate each other right but fundamentally right they they all they can't get along but they're all magicians right they're all super passionate about this really tiny thing they should all be getting along and i feel like when you get into tech you get the same kind of like little like wars over you're using it wrong or whatever and it's just dumb i mean you use these tools the way that works for you you know um the um and i do use it for idea development like i showed you earlier with the spark eos the ideas but i also use it for a lot of storage of you know process and project tracking and it's kind of like obsidian really is the center of my kind of digital universe everything kind of links in and out of obsidian yeah that makes that that's really good okay so going down we're at yeah this is people this is people and companies like you know sometimes i create a link i'll have one in you know for nick you know and nick milo and and and it's just sometimes i'll i don't always turn those into notes you know because you don't need to with obsidian but sometimes i do you know like all of a sudden if you and i have a phone call i want to track you know you told me your daughter's name or something or or whatever if we talked about something that i need to make note of i will actually create a note for you and i put it in the people folder and i have subfolders there i don't want to open it now but i've got some folders in there for like work related client related family related sparky related so i've kind of got it organized a little bit but i've got a bunch of notes on people in there also um you can turn obsidian into a rudimentary you know you know like client tracking app you know if you just add some templates in there you know if you want to to track transactions and and communications uh i don't really go too far down that rabbit hole but that's that's what i use for people personal is like personal stuff like if i have notes about like i've got a whole folder in there full of my various health melodies you know i like i've i've said on the show i have glaucoma and so i've got a note that's got all my glaucoma notes and then uh when i go into the doctor and she says well what medications were you on last year i can tell her because it's all recorded in my notes in there and that's um just kind of a personal reference thing and you know just think of all the different things personally you may want to track information on this gives me a place to put it and and i've tried to do this in the past with other apps you know i've tried to do it with apple notes with with drafts which i love drafts but i just really like the visual nature of obsidian the way with this folder structure i can very quickly get to any little segment of my life and see all my notes on that and it just works that way yeah you want me to continue oh yeah yeah that's the only thing i'd say no no the only thing i'd say about personal is uh that's really great to track those you know ailments uh for me was an injuries thing yeah that um because i'll forget after three years that oh i did i hurt my wrist i did this one thing i heard it and then you know how it eventually got better but now um you know these things add up over time and it's good to be able to go you know talk to somebody and kind of have this hey this is a history of what's happened here here's my thought process on it i'm not a doctor so i could be wrong but what do you think and then i just feel so much more prepared when i go into you know those type of checkups or whatever yeah or even just something dumb like when the insurance company says there's a special test you need and you've got to call this one phone number to schedule that test and i just put it in that note it's related to glaucoma and if i have to go schedule that test again i know where the phone number is you know i don't feel like it deserves a contact but i do want that information all in one place and um you know and there's other categories i have in there that are not health related but i mean just it's just personal stuff that i i need to keep track of so i'm looking at our agenda and i think we're kind of flying through all the stuff just by going through the folder so i'd say hey let's just keep it going all right let's do it uh plan and review is um where i keep uh track of different things that you know like i do monthly quarterly and uh weekly reviews and i i store them here and um i'm right now in a little bit of a crossroads on this one here let me just create a new note and show you um and also say um weekly week review you know and then i i use to trigger templates i use command t i built that shortcut in if i just type weak you see week plan and review and i do weak plan review together and that just drops in a template that i've created and it uses the template title entry and i know templater is a better plugin it's on my list i'm gonna learn that that plug and i just haven't got to it yet but i'm just using the built-in template i use some yaml data here for tags and then i give like an overview how the week went and then i talked earlier about how roles are central to my whole system i look at how i did in each role and then what i want to do better in each role so i'll say you know you know spent time with daisy and then like if i want to do something more i'll say you know buy her flowers i mean this isn't what i would put in but you know something like that and so i would have a um at the end of the review and i do this every sunday i would look at how i did in the last week and what i want to do better in the next week and then i do the same thing on a monthly and quarterly basis i go through each role you know and then some of this stuff i have subcategories here and so first i go through all the roles then i have a weekly checklist and that's just stuff that i do every weekend you know just stuff to keep my uh you know the wheel was the trains running on time or whatever so and i don't i historically i would do that omnifocus but i've moved this over because it just makes sense to have the checklist in the same place you do the review and then i have all these questions that i ask myself and i don't answer every question every time i do the review but i do have a bunch of them and then by creating them as links i can have a page that has backlinks to every time i address you know what should i do more of and uh so i can just go through this about i'm sorry go ahead i was just gonna say yeah i'm just curious about the the backlinks because you you were talking we're talking off-camera about with the daily note that the backlinks can kind of clutter up the graph and how yeah how funny it is how our tools shape our behavior so but with the week review it's still worthwhile to have in the backlink so it's probably not worthwhile honestly i set that up when i was still in you know a backlink nirvana or backlink you know that when you first start learning about backlinks you want to put them everywhere the template was set up but to be honest with you i can't think of any time in the last six months i've gone to one of these pages to say give me a list of every time i wrote about that if anything i'll go back and look at the reviews but i usually look at them the following week the following month the following quarter um so in all honesty i should probably pull those backlinks out of those it's a work in progress nick this is it's a work in progress i'm not i'm not grilling you i did i'm trying to learn yeah yeah as much as possible yeah i feel the same the same way though it's um you we can go because we want to we we experiment a lot with links i experiment with a lot and then i'm like yeah okay that didn't that didn't work um that's fine that was my little two-week experiment um so let me go back to to this it's really funny and i'm torn between doing these in obsidian or doing them in day one because i have a journaling system so i i write in the journal but i live in a place that catches on fire yearly so um last year we got evacuated a few times and both times you know because of the rush of evacuation you know the police are driving down the street saying get out of your house and uh i just forgot to bring my paper journals and they were all if the house had burned down that would all be gone so i started now i scan the written journal page each day into day one and part of me thinks well maybe i should just do these reviews in day one but so far i i like obsidian because i can link them to projects and that actually is a backlink i like like when i'm writing down my thoughts about something i'm working on what i want to get better at and then i go like the devon think field guide i'm finishing up now and if i go to devon thing field guides page i can look at all the backlinks to the reviews where i was thinking about it or writing about it and i actually find those backlinks kind of useful so i'm probably just going to keep it here but you know i'm always kind of like trying to to figure out the best method for this stuff but so planning review is a collection of um of monthly quarterly and weekly reviews that being said i also have a ton of project related files that are are planning and reviewing really in essence but they don't fall into this folder um resources is just a collection of um of you know like when i find a specific youtube video on interstitial journaling and i want to make a note on that video they go into here and i just break them down you know by my format and you know moving these by the way you know because i know people watching are like this guy it's way too many folders but but moving this stuff around is super easy i've got uh this entitled one that i made like i just mapped control m to move so i can just say you know put this into the daily uh folder and i just moved into the daily folder and so you know and because i've got a folder for like each client and for each major in my life it you know it's not a big deal to to kind of get these things organized very quickly you know that's such a huge that's such a huge point i just want to hammer that one home because there is there's a hotkey that you can program to quickly whatever file you're on you can move it into a folder and it's pretty magical once you get it it's like wow i it works so fast yeah i know i know and the um i mean the thing about obsidian is everything is programmable i mean that is like one of the things that really attracts me to the app i can i can really make it work the way my brain thinks and now it syncs all that stuff so it's even better um roles i already talked to you about but this is just all the roles you know that i have and these are all the notes on those roles and um spark's law is uh and i've gutted this for the purpose of today's thing but uh if you went in my actual vault there is you know hundreds of client folders here and each one has different clients on it and so a whole nother use i have for obsidian is client project tracking and um you know so i've got you know at any one time a bunch of projects i'm working on for clients and i have a template that i've built and you can i'm sorry this the zoom got in the way there we go so i've i made this thing and it's got this yaml format here and the payoff for this i'll show you in just a minute with my kanban but the um uh it's got this yaml format and so i can put omnifocus folder or devin think league's explanation of status all in the ammo and then for each new client project i always a couple years ago i started doing some projects that i shouldn't have been doing so now i force myself to answer with each new project to take is this something in my wheelhouse do i have time are there no other warning signs oh there's a typo there no warning signs i should pay attention to and i literally force myself to ask those three questions for every new project i take and then and then here i have links to the omnifocus task list and the key documents and emails project timeline and then i i keep an activity log and the activity log every time i touch that project i log it in the activity log and this is where i go crazy with links like with apple mail i have an apple script it's at macsparky.com if you want to go download it but i just hit control k on any apple mail message and it copies a url link to that message so i can put a link to the email message i can put a link to the devin think document or a link using hook i can put a link to the file in my icloud data storage or i can put a link to the omnifocus project so i have links built throughout this whole document and that's why this is kind of the central hub and every time i want to touch this project i hit command o you know type in a few letters and it opens the project and i can do whatever work i need on the project and then i've logged it and um it's super useful because i have a lot of projects and i can't i don't want to store all that in my brain you know you know the more people study the brain the more they realize brains are not you know storage you know they're active cpu they're not storage right so we want to uh to get all that out of out of my brain and i put it in here and i have you know even just having started in september i have this massive library now of data and i've been doing things like this in the past using apple notes and other formats so i i brought that data in but this new system is so much better because you know two brackets you start typing it autofills the link and um it's just you know this is something that is not about idea development at all it's just about tracking a project and making sure that i'm on top of it and if somebody asks me six months later you know what did you do this or when did you do this i can just go look it up on my on my project page and then and it's good i love the project hub and i you're able to show me this um offline before we went on but one of the the cool things here that just what you just said out loud was that you had links to all these external uh programs yeah and but you have this project hub and and um so thinking about ways i'm just thinking about all the different external links that you know i could set up in my own project hubs yeah yeah the trick is to be picky about the apps you use make sure you use apps that are url link friendly and you're good you know like omnifocus lets you create a url link for any project perspective task or whatever the devin think allows you to create a url link for anything in the in the database if you want to use native files out of the finder you have to use an app called hook because hook allows you to create those but you know most you know good citizens in this kind of space do have url linking and so does um you know so does obsidian you know if i hit command u which i just did i don't know if you see the the note i got up there in the corner but i hit command u i just copy a link to any note in obsidian i just added a keyboard shortcut for url so then i can go over to omnifocus and say if i've got the rotoner versus wiley coyote you know project in omnifocus i paste the url link for obsidian in the omnifocus information panel and i've got a custom metadata in devon think that says obsidian and i just paste the obsidian url there so from any place in the chain i can get back to the home base of obsidian and all i have to do is hit command u and then it's copied you know so um in fact early days on the obsidian forums i was the one writing you know really gross keyboard microscope scripts to try and get urls out and then finally i think the developers felt sorry for me they just added it in that's great yeah there's so much connectivity that's that's possible um i'm trying to think what we have to cover before we open it up for questions let me show you just a couple more things real quick uh with a sample client i also have a template for that and um if i hit sparks law client template you see i've got a whole list of different questions i asked before taking out a new client and you know different kind of log for that and one other thing two two more things i want to show you templates i've gone a little crazy with you know i've got templates based on area of my life you know like to make an automator's episode you know here i'll just hit command t automators and then here is an example where i'm not using omnifocus i just have a checklist based on what i do for each episode of the automators and the um and you know historically i would do that in omnifocus but this is something where a list makes sense on the project page um the vast majority of my task management omnifocus because i want a thing that can give me project review and give me deadlines and things but but i don't you but this is an example of something i do and then the last bit i want to just show you before we open it up is the sparky os kanban i don't know how to pronounce it is it kanban or con but i was actually going to ask you too i'm curious if anyone who if anyone has a strong opinion like in the comments and stuff can or khan yeah yeah but this is the um this is my kind of mission panel for the whole day i've written about this at max parque i did it with the omni grapple for a while but then i've switched over but for each area of my life you know there's the law max sparky field guides and personal and every project that i have and this is a sanitized version for this video but the one that i use in real life has a lot more in it and i've got all these you know panels that i can just move around say this is the active project today this one is on hold and um and i can just go through and keep track of it and at the end of each day when i do my shutdown routine i take a look at them i'd kind of design the next day around this panel about what's going to get worked on in the following day and the other thing i'm doing with this is here let me show you in one i can't um i can't really show you in the devil think it's got a bunch of private links in it but the um but i'm using um yaml up here and i can create an omnifocus url and create a folder url which will either go to dev and think or the finder whether i'm using hook or devin think and then i have what's the reason this is on hold you know and i'm saying you know waiting on form and um and i've got more yaml forms i'll show you in just a minute but so i add those links to it and i add an explanation and then if i go back to the kanban board i can see here you know what why is this on hold well it's on hold because i'm waiting on the form you know i don't even need to open it up and then over on this i'm not going to use this because like i said there's some private stuff in here but this if i click this button it goes to the omnifocus project i click this button it goes to the devon thing folder if i click this it goes to the air table where me and the editor are working and this goes to the base camp for me and the team working on this field guide and so i can get in addition to jumping to the obsidian node i can also get to all those external links right from the kanban board and the way i do that is with this kanban plug-in if you scroll to the bottom you've got the ability to add metadata and i just added separate metadata keys for all of those things error table basecamp why is it on hold and then if as long as i add them to the yaml it shows up there and i know i'm kind of like rushing through this but you get the idea yeah i love what you're doing there with the the apparently kanban board i'm going to have to i'm going to say it incorrectly a lot and yeah apparently it's a japanese word yeah yeah it is i know it's japanese but i didn't yeah thank you for that actually i mentioned it i can't think of any japanese words that use the a as in can i think they're all con yeah okay gotta reprogram uh yeah kanban well okay so i know we're rushing we even had a couple things that we didn't hit on too directly but let's let's open it up um for questions because apparently there are about like 47 or so questions we're not going to get to them all everyone but uh uh first of all let's just give let's just give david a round of applause let's let's hear it up for david that's all right thanks let's see some virtual there's a virtual claps going on and the reactions okay they're just flooding in it's always uh fun uh virtually to figure out how to show appreciation but uh but it's there and and again another thing that you haven't mentioned um because just how gracious you are and everything but guys check out the the max sparky field guides and but there was a question i think people are wondering when the obsidian mack sparky field guide might be available i i think you hear that i'm going to make one eventually the thing is they're not really even at version 1.0 yet and uh i kind of want to wait until the development cycle settles i mean right now we're getting massive updates almost like on a weekly basis and i don't want to release a course and then have everything change the following week and i'm settling into kind of how i think the app should be used and i don't want to make the course until i feel like i'm an expert at it so my guess will be it'll be later in the year or early next year so i i'm you know it's it'll be a while i'm not rushing into it yet but i i'm gonna going to eventually make one but right now everything is feels to me like the only way to really approach is the way you're doing it is um of you know kind of weekly you're going in and updating it frequently with your your videos or like mike and the sweet setup are doing where they're updating videos um but right now i i just feel like it's too early for me to go into that app but i i will do one eventually i definitely feel that things change rapidly the one i'm still trying to figure out myself is you know how will i be using yaml in what capacity um yeah let's see these these questions um thank you to deirdre and helen along with daniel for kind of organizing organizing these a little bit can you explain more about setting roles or what is your process of setting roles rather than setting goals yeah i mean the uh i learned originally that you know the top of the pyramid or you know or maybe the the bottom depending on how you think about it is goals you know like you have a goal and then you design your habits and your your planning around that but i always found that as kind of empty and you know the problem is what happens after you achieve the goal does that mean that all that doesn't matter anymore and mike schmitz and i talked about this on focus where he's talking about when he ran a marathon and then he got to the end and he's like okay now what you know i achieved the goal you know but i think the thing is um when i was in college i studied political philosophy you know it's kind of weird i was an aerospace engineering major that switched to political science because i wanted to go to law school and but i got to read all the ancients and that was like one of the best things that i ever did and there was this greek concept of arete which is your idealized self and as i started thinking about that you know my idealized self is not someone who ran a marathon or somebody who plays the field guide it's somebody who's an excellent an excellent husband you know a good friend and so it just became kind of natural for me to think well um if if that the role is the foundation of what i want to be then that has to be the foundation of the system and like every project i take on everything i do how is that feeding into that role you know which role am i feeding and which one am i uh you know and how am i doing all that and by building those role audits into my my reviews it forces me to ask the question like one of the roles i added after i can and this happened over time i didn't like once again this isn't the thing where you just sit down and do it in one sitting but something you think about like uh you know after a while one of the things that occurred to me was that you know i wasn't doing enough um of altruism you know i'm spending all my time making things you know seems like everything i do is about me and i want to be more altruistic so i added that as a role in now that's in the system and every week i ask what did i do this week to help somebody else and you know once you start making yourself accountable those roles then suddenly you start making progress on them and it's really an ever-ending quest you know they are the idea of rita is is you know you may never get there but so long as you're trying you know that's that's the game yeah what a beautiful word so much from the yeah i know i i love it and it's like if you if you really dove into my database you'd see that it's all over the place because that that concept is for me that that's the cornerstone of everything you know and there's something to that too of those cornerstone concepts in a database like this that you always refer to yeah part of the part of the operating system um yeah for me for me that one's like a positive feedback loop or just thinking about how um whatever you focus on is the kind of wherever your focus attention goes is wherever meaning will grow and uh i'm always fascinated by that that concept another question let's see here do you consider obsidian sync to be safe for your law practice data yeah i pay for the end-to-end encryption so it's using my date my password and nothing is stored on cloud storage uh you know a mistake you make is they'll do end in encryption but then they'll store it on icloud or dropbox and that's a mistake but everything is stored locally and i have indian encryption enabled i think it's it's more secure than what most people do you know um that's the way to do it and just finding out so yeah that's also known as zero knowledge um only which is like only you it depends on where you're saving your your information but only you have access and no one from obsidian can touch it yeah yeah i mean because i i do think like i was talking to someone recently who said i'm using nd encryption but then he showed me his library and it was stored in icloud i'm like you're not you're not indian encrypted anymore you know the obsidian piece is ended and encrypted but now your data is on the apple server because you put it on icloud so what i do is even on the iphone and the ipad which seems counter-intuitive because you forget that those things even have a local storage but you store the data on device and just enable end to end i mean i was i think the first i was bugging the developers about end-to-end encryption months before they released it and as soon as i released it i think i was one of the first people to give them my money yeah yeah okay so you store it on device on your your ios and ipad devices and then yeah um do you so for this for your client data you probably wouldn't use something like a dropbox or an icloud no no no my whole vault is on local storage even the dumb stuff i write about my own musings it's all done the same way gotcha yeah uh what theme are you using uh depends you know i'm not really happy with any of them the um i usually use uh yeah i don't i just can't i've just never got real comfortable with the look of obsidian to be honest with you but uh obsidian nord is one of my favorites and only and i go in you know every month or two and see what the latest are and let me just look here currently trying one out obsidian nord is the one i had turned on for this session but i just tried one out called ever forest which is a new one which i kind of like do you want a screen share you want to share yeah okay let me turn that on yeah so before it's just kind of nice too you know and this is the light version of it um you know i kind of grew up with computers that were green text on black screen and we were so happy when it got light that it's hard for me to get into dark view but here's their dark view which i think is pretty nice um the um but you know i i'm literally if you look i've downloaded them all and i i switch between them but i like it kind of subtle you know minimal obsidian nord ever forest there's this one i kind of like to um so i switch them up but i i don't have like a go-to theme and i don't like the ones that are really loud you know i just but i i do like um it kind of subtle and then i generally keep up sitting in full screen on the leftmost screen in spaces on a mac so if i just go to the left i've got all my obsidian data because i'm jumping out of it all day gotcha that makes a lot of sense so um so you you definitely won't like cybertron yeah i know well i am such a fan of your work i downloaded cybertron i'm like oh not for me what is that for me [Laughter] uh it brings it brings me joy so that's that's my god and that's the beauty is that you know people design so many fun ones so yeah yeah and you guys i agree and it's cool and i like the community and but you know it just it's just not really it doesn't look like a mac up and and um and i do like that the themes exist because i'm always got a roving eye and i can look at the app with just you know a few clicks so that's nice too yeah so here's a big one what is toxic productivity yeah i mean it's just we just did an episode of this on focus but i it's something that's always on my mind i think a lot of people go down these roads of these books and these tools um you know an effort to always find what's new and shiny and they don't actually get any work done and maybe it's a variety of productivity porn i don't know you know there's a lot of different ways to go around it but um you know it's just the idea that uh you spend all your time you know shining your pencil instead of writing anything yeah you know i think i went through that and maybe maybe we kind of have to but um when we enter the world as like a young adult and we're trying to find our way yeah um it's probably the best time to you know go in on the deep end sometimes and make a lot of mistakes quickly and but then eventually if you take that route you know recognize when it's becoming a huge problem and that you have to you know one of the quotes that really helped me get out of this was just uh you know some of the best ideas you you have are the ones you've already had and and yeah stop look looking elsewhere it's just like look look from within you've lived a good life you've had a lot of your own experiences work with it but yeah so i love how you guys have put a spotlight on toxic productivity yeah well it's like for example in the mac power users forums there's a ongoing thread about people who are into explain and people who are into craft and like i just wanted to be really friendly in there because these are apps that do largely the same thing and you know different you know flowers grow in different soil and you know if that works for you then use it but you don't need to spend all your time jumping between them because as you said there's a huge cost to moving data you know um and the uh so once you find kind of space just sit with it and get good at it before you know don't leave unless you have a really good reason yeah yeah well said what are personal retreats and how do you do them i know this is like a huge huge thing so i don't know how yeah yeah i did a video um yeah we can put a link i did a video on it in youtube but i made a little guide but um people ask when people ask the question about roles that's the time where i spend a lot of time thinking about roles but it's just the idea of um kind of stepping aside i i really believe in the and i wish i remember who came up with the idea first but the concept of maker and manager where you are sometimes a maker and sometimes a manager and um you need to wear both hats if you're going to be you know productive and get stuff done but you need to give each hat its place and like for me a retreat is a pla time to put on the manager hat and really question things um because so often the way i work is i just put my head down on a project and go and um i don't stop you know lift my head to see if i'm marching in the right direction you know that's why i need time as a as a manager to kind of figure that out and i do that through the the personal retreat so check that out i did a video on it kind of you can go go into detail there i just shared the link on to that video in the chat and uh but just overall like for those who somehow don't know how how can people best learn about you um can i point i mean should they the field guides i think is a really good spot to go do you have other places where you should point folks too yeah so all the field guides are at learn.mac sparky.com some of them are free some of them cost and um and that's where that's like my primary outlet where i create these courses and i it's like one of the things i just love doing you know it's a so it's something i'm very passionate about so if you go to learn.maxparkey.com you find that if you just go to maxsparky.com that's the blog and that's kind of the the hub of me on the internet so you've got links there to the podcast to all the field guides and i i post there pretty regularly um it could be something about productivity it could be something about the new apple keyboard which i think is with the last one that went up so it's kind of eclectic but um you know it's stuff that i'm interested in that i think can help and i've been writing that since i think 2005. so it's i've been at it a while to that point and something i wrote elsewhere is that you're one of the most trusted and cherished voices and it's not just me saying that but that's the overall sentiment out there and uh and so i jumped back into the field guides and i downloaded um i think the fantastical one which is even it's free like you're just providing it yeah because i use that and but i know i'm not using it you know well enough so i'm excited to dive into it have you moved notes out of devon think and what if any issues did you find during that conversion i primarily moved out notes out of drafts and apple notes i've never been as much as i like devin think for file and document management i've never been a particular fan of it for notes management in fact the devon think field guide i've got going on right now i'm doing interviews with some people who are power notes users because i wanted to make sure we covered it better than i do um the um the other thing is great especially like i said the ai the file the links but i didn't it's just not nimble enough for me for notes and um obsidian is much better at that so so the way i move notes out of apple notes and and drafts is i created a keyboard maestro script that copies the text and like if i had to do any formatting stuff i did that i have a similar script to get stuff out of obsidian that does a search and replace and replaces double brackets and some of the stuff that's obsidian specific markdown and so i just made a simple script and then i imported stuff as i needed but i do think one of the tricks with the obsidian if you're getting into it is not to dump a thousand notes into it let it grow organically yeah amen to that the organic the emergent growth when you want to structure some things okay quickly test something out but uh don't overdo it i'll let it come to you let's see what else here's another one maybe this will be our last one how do you avoid over foldering topics and ideas i.e a folder for each document at what point are you overdoing it splitter versus grouper and i'm going to just put that in the chat so it's yeah no i that i get it um uh i'm pretty uh careful about that honestly so like for each you saw my client folder and each one there's a separate folder for each client but in that rarely are there any additional folders as long as you name the notes appropriately you can see the difference between them i have very few folders with one note or you know something like that in them i've always kind of felt like you know you want folders to be as shallow as they can be but not so shallow that they don't work for you and i don't know it's just kind of intuitive honestly i don't i don't really think about much if i if i see a folder that has one document and i don't see that there's really going to be a future for a lot more documents in it i would just drag the the document to the root folder of that and just delete the folder but i it's not an issue for me i don't it's not really a problem okay okay very good and i'm trying to think david what if i not covered or asked that maybe you want to just make sure that we share i just think it's a real fun journey with obsidian honestly it's um you know there's been times in my life where i saw a new technology emerge around me and as somebody who's kind of geeky that is always exciting and i feel like the personal acknowledgement space just blew up in the last 18 months and we're seeing this explosion of tools and options and everybody's finding different ways to deal with it and these are the times that i love being geeky because getting into the stuff and figuring out how it works for me is so fun you know and i i would encourage people out there that are thinking about this stuff to go in and figure out what this means to you because the technology has got to a point now where we have options we didn't have before you know the external brain is real with this stuff and uh it really wasn't with the prior tools so have fun with it all right well hey one more round of applause for david yeah yeah thanks everybody what an amazing time i'm so grateful and cherish this so much so my pleasure nick and thanks for everything you're making i mean i really i really dig it well we'll just keep the party going and see where it all leads okay [Music] [Music] you
