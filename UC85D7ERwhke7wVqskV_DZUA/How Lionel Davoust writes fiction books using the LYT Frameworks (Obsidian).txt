game of thrones and is often compared to the biggest names in the field somehow he is also a podcaster blogger electronic musician and marine biologist in the following presentation lionel showcases what i think is a breakthrough method of writing fiction he introduces the tesseract dilemma and shares his excitement for how well the light frameworks fit the act of writing and world building let's view lionel's presentation now so i have been saying i work very much with the garage door closed so i'm sorry i won't be showing you obsidian or anything but i have screenshots and we're at the end of a workshop so i have a powerpoint like any good students does so hopefully this is going to be just entertaining uh nick as i've been saying i'm going to try and watch the time but i can be very talkative so by all means shut me up for a living i make a living basically selling entertaining lives and hopefully spreading them as much as i can so i write fiction i write mostly science fiction and fantasy and i i write big books the latest one is almost a thousand pages long and the problem is there is also that i'm building uh mostly a big world which is mostly the the things you see in the background and i'm writing this big saga at the time but i have other things which are happening in other times and other places and everything kind of ties to something else which is beginning to be a little too much for my poor small head also what i've been uh doing and trying my hand at is working and on building book five in the series i'm working on which is the one in the background using the light frameworks and to see how this would work a spoiler that it works very well so i'm i'm trying to build that book and also getting some order into my notes because i am really feeling that at this point in time i will have finished that series of five books i have other short stories and three other books in the same world i can't hold everything in my head anymore and i i need to to put some sanity into this as much as can be so yeah also this saga in itself has a lot of intricate settlements going everywhere i have like six to eight main characters per book which makes tracking everything pretty much insane the problem basically with fiction is what i call the tesseract dilemma i'm currently working on also on a short essay about writing fiction for young rights and the the tesseract is basically a it's a hyper-dimensional tube you a cube works in three dimensions a tesseract is like the same thing but with four dimensions which you cannot represent on paper and fiction kind of works this way you are reading sentence after sentence a story and the writer's job is to create a multi-dimensional theater of characters moods emotion smells views in your head which is basically trying to fit a multi-dimensional construct into something which is has only one dimension which is reading one sentence after one another which is the hard thing to do and i really face that as i'm re writing this essay writing which is insanely simple to write because i only follow one thread of reasoning fiction is a lot harder so on the on the side is my little thing you might have seen on the forums which basically describes how fiction writing works the light bulb basically means you have ideas and these ideas as you refine them and go through them build a hypothesis which is the the meaning of the arrow like for instance you have a few ideas coming to a character and that kind of creates this idea of the character and then you start writing the things that you have written start imprinting even stronger hypothesis on the work you're doing like for instance if your character doesn't like cake in chapter one he cannot not like cake in chapter five which is the meaning of the exclamation mark and this kind of builds a circle that feeds on itself as slowly uh the the story gets its own momentum and i'm not inventing anything here basically aristotle will say it before everyone else as with many things and as you as you go the tricky thing in fiction i think is that identifying the hard questions which is the the red question mark which are the questions that are kind of blocking your way the difficult things you have to answer in order to move forward like uh i have to write a scene where does it take place what's the goal what's the aim what do my characters want etc and another thing usually is to identify those questions as kim robinson if i remember correctly said creativity is not about finding the answers but identifying the questions and basically writing the first draft is just identifying the questions once you have the first draft done you have an answer and then you can make the answer as best as you can and that's the rewriting process so in writing the questions i always strive to come back to is what do i know and what do i want which is basically what do i need to be writing the damn thing because exploring is all well and fun but i need to produce a story if i want to eat with that in mind i've been trying to build these were my workflows and with that in mind i've been trying to build a book with the light frameworks and what i found is that it's very easy to just jot down random ideas in separate atomic notes like i have an idea for a scene i haven't just an idea also for a punchline for something that could just happen it's very easy to just write that down in obsidian in a designated folder and then it's also very easy to track things into maps of contents like for instance things for a character the random bits and pieces can become its own map of content which is a character story arc things about the world everything uh kind of builds itself and it's exactly what nick said about the idea emergence it really really spoke deeply to me because it was basically explaining what i had been struggling to formulate all my writing career so choices and decisions emerge which lays the groundwork for further development and what is amazing is that it's simply impossible to not have any ideas doing this at first when i started uh working on this at the very beginning of the workshop i just said well you know what i'm just gonna get all the random notes i've written for this book in scrivener and i'm just going to inventory them in obsidian and see how this works following in a very you know like like a pupil school following the framework and from the very beginning it wasn't impossible to just not stop building upon those things from like an hour in and i was like oh this is not only this amazing but this is a thoughtless and fun and almost feel guilty and what is also amazing is that i find that clearly identifying the unknown parts of a project i think it works on writing but it kind of works for every every thing creative i think it is amazingly burdening and calming because it's like putting a pin on a question and saying yes i have to figure that out but it's clearly identified it's clearly like a part of the graph that can grow in its own time and i don't have that question in my head i know it's there i know it's identified and i can just come to it as it uh when i want to and as it wants so i promised a few screenshots so this was my graph my obsidian graph like a week ago it's funny because it's already grown way beyond that but there are three basic ensembles uh and the the big blue one which is really really intricate is the book in informing the orange one is my men's little cast under construction and the purple one which is kind of developed because it's what i've also been working on the past month and a half it's my light workshop notes comments and observations which are more like source or literature notes which will be refined at some point into the main zero orgasm i found what it was interesting compared to everything is that the the map corresponding to the book is so intricate intensely and intricately linked which kind of makes sense because in a story everything depends on everything else i talked to nick about this but if you've seen the old movie the abyss at the end there's this huge alien platform rising from the sea bottom and writing a book is very much like this you have like landmarks and then you work to dig or to have the thing rise from the sea floor but everything depends on everything else because the decision of a character in chapter one can have repercussions in chapter 25 so everything works intricately together and your work is to work on all dimensions at once in order to keep your balance and have everything emerge which is what nick says about emergency i used to use the word aggression which is like you know could be could be described as an oyster getting a grain of sand and making a pearl out of it and i find that the comparison with writers quite adequate because we live in we live in damp and dark areas and we have like allergic reactions which go through us and what's important and what i found had to be taken care of is that since it's uh simultaneous emergence there needs to be constant refactoring and i thank the workshop for the talks about this and discourse and constant uh map of contenting uh but it's okay because it's the work it's going back to your match to you to your material over and over and over again and seeing again again again again over under new lights it's what the work is about and it's how you keep adding and adding and adding new strata to it until you're ready to get writing what i found also was that block references are very handy but since there's a lot of refactoring going on i started over using them and it really really slowed down the refactoring process so i found that it's easier to make new notes and to embed those notes rather than use block references because when you do new notes you can just rename them very easily which happens a lot if you refactor stuff but if you start having very long notes and start referencing blocks when you want to you know split those nuts off you have to basically redo all your block references and it's a hassle so just a screenshot of a few of the notes which are happening inside the novel so i have like the main map of contents i have a few questions like big big order of things like what does what character what will uh that character do or where is uh that character and also things that i already know which are signaled by the arrows things that can be possible with the light bulbs and things that i have done that i must not forget to tackle or say or or solve because it comes from the the previous books which is the exclamation marks what's important is that anything can become a map of content uh and but basically the end goal is not to world build for the sake of it we've talked about this with price on on discord my end goal is always to write the damn thing uh it's all well and fun to build worlds and and get sucked into your world it's very fun but this is leisure my goal is to produce story and i try very much to not forget this if i need to flesh out an aspect of the world to be able to write the thing it's all well and good but i need to write the damn thing so what's also i saw i heavily use the emoji in my file names and it's also interesting because anything that's an emojis kind of signals jumping points i can think well i'm going to solve oh what question do also oh this this yeah i feel like going through this and also i have the top level maps of content so we can which can help us jump in points and slowly basically questions meet ideas and turn into hypothesis and this is how the story structure is built and since i'm working the very world i already know that i need at the very end of the project i will need to go through all of this to transfer the material which has kind of become canon which is published into a separate area of my obsidian vault where i have the same kind of structure but operates at the level of the world itself and the whole franchise so to speak so here i have the main map of content for the book itself so it's in french but at the beginning i'm like yeah the my what are my priorities are i have also another maps of content which is the characters themselves how i am building the thing where are the main questions also what i want which is what are the themes what's the atmosphere what i'm looking for what i'm trying to do there and notes when we're building so the idea really is to remember what i want from this because the story kind of takes some life on itself but it's it's uh it's a collaborative work between me and my unconscious all the mystery or the muse whatever you want to to put behind that i federate the small questions into higher level uh questions which are also maps of content and the big idea of this is to understand the order of the answers i have like this big unknown and where do i need to tackle things uh where does the first where do the first answer come from and also but it's also very fluid and it enables me to tackle the book not through plot or not through characters or not through the world but through anything depending on the need or the feel sometimes a plot takes precedence the plot takes precedence for writing a scene sometimes it's more atmospheric and the breathing scene and it's the characters sometimes it's tackle it's it's related to my whole project with this world and then i will have to to tackle things through the world i have not enough became followers at the moment i have basically the daily notes i have workshops which uh where the the project of the book and future books live and i have also the light light kit the the light workshop and also i have my two main worlds which are like uh also big workshops but they're important enough that they need their own their own areas and but everything can be linked as i'm working on the book five of the series there's a lot of links going to the areas with the world itself and and and lots of back and forth and i'll be in the two years i'll be working on a third big science fiction world so this is where it's going to live as well uh i'm using daily notes as inspired by nick and some of you for journaling and seeing concepts emerge slowly the workshops are for projects in active development and universes for sustain world building and story ideas that might become short stories or words or insane five book long sagas i don't have a home note yet because it's not earned um and i don't feel the need for it at the moment at the moment i feel like the everything has to still coalesce together so the high order maps of content to zelda and gravitate freely i very much know what i'm putting in my system so a quick search and a few keyboard maestro macros enable me to find stuff very easily at the moment and when it's not gonna work anymore i'm going to gravitate towards the homeless as i'm still thinking a lot about processing newness because my job is very peculiar in the way that anything can become story folder anything that comes my way which is just random can become an interesting thing which can inspire me to to uh develop a theme or something for four stories so um i have a very very clear separation i'm a big gdd proponent so i have very clear separation between tasks which uh i use uni focus for and my notes where omnifocus which are divided between the one thing for source material and obsidian for notes my inputs go from everywhere instead paper drafts youtube my podcast and everything and it's more or less the reason why i have this folder structure on the right which is priority things which is things i really really need to to to read or to process should which is things i know i should kind of get into but it's not urgent fun which is just purely for fun purposes cat videos and and uh and the like and the saddle casting candidates which is material i know that i can extract thoughts and insights from and also i have what i call idea netflix which is the whole rest netflix you're not supposed to watch everything on this and this is i still fall into kind of a collector's fantasy but i very much know this is like netflix i just clip whatever passes and if it disappears tomorrow i'm not i won't be uh i won't be sad it's just you know open this just dive into something and see where it goes and if it's an interesting it's very quickly deleted and and uh and no matter it's really like you know turning on the tv or or turning on netflix but in a productive way and as the noisy area to go back to next terminology i'm using drafts as the holding place of ideas and an obsidian as the place of proof and it's incredibly freeing and the light works wonderful friction so that's that's the scrivener screenshot fraud the book being currently being built fiction and art is all about emerging emergence so of course this works very well and it's very easy to uh it's it's amazing to have that very fluid structure where everything can influence anything and licks and maps of content reflect that and it's really really easy to reconfigure and just refactor on the fly and because the understanding of a rider revolves all the time so refactoring is built in fluidity and this works amazingly well and with almost no effort or at least not no no overheads i mean the only effort is just about thinking which is what what you want also it's very easy to deprecate notes or branches you know ideas that are not welcome or that are not good anymore or that i don't think are valuable i can just duplicate them very easily but not in uh using the computer term but not losing them simply by reconfiguring the links i have already a holding area for deprecated areas and deprecated ideas or things that i've just don't think are really working but i have them i know i can get back to them i know that if there's something to refactor and salvage it solo as possible and yeah emoji is for the win and well that's it thank you for watching all right nice job lionel round of applause yeah no this is this is great i think there are a lot of different areas we can jump into and thanks for showing that i know it's it's you put that all together because the garage door is closed as it should be for you and uh and so for you to go to the effort to put together that presentation i think we're all enriched for it so just wanted to thank you for that thank you um yeah so yeah let's let's open let's open the gates for questions i just have a comment i thought that was like nick said very enriching there's a lot of things that i didn't know before like the tesseract dilemma and such and i really appreciated the way that you described how you're using the light frameworks to build um a world for fiction writing because i could kind of see where you were going with it and i could see how i could imagine what how you are connecting everything at the end of the day um with the characters and such and is all sort of it probably looks like amazing on your end to see like how everything relates to one another versus i don't know another way to write the only other ways i've seen of writing are like file folder ones and so i'm just very intrigued and impressed by how you built that out and you built out a system to to do that for for fiction writing i'm kind of excited to see if i can maybe like replicate something like that for a very short story thank you and well that i also thank you everyone and thank you nick and thank you for the discussions i i used to work a lot with files and folders because that pretty much was all we had even though scrivener does wiki linking it's a little cumbersome to use so i only ever used it when it was really relevant so i was working with files and folders and it was horribly messy and it needed a lot of work and also anxiety because i i yeah i can i can share this on the on the top of my desk i have words from elizabeth george uh which i have uh which are taken from her old journals and it goes this way uh the writing i'm scared i have so much to work to do i'm feeling afraid i'm feeling as if i don't have an adequate handle of this on the story that's the truth i don't but what i'm going to do with this i'm going to move the novel forward by five pages every day and i honestly don't know a writer who doesn't feel like this and because it really feels like we never have an adequate handle on the story which is kind of normal some extent because it's creativity and we don't really fully know where we're going but i always thought gosh would there finally be a way to just have everything in my head a little more but files and folders doesn't give you that overview while fluid frameworks uh it's it's really been tremendously liberating to because it encompasses the unknown and it's really really relaxing and uh it's amazing to be able to to work on this without stress maybe also i'm saying this because my deadline is over a year away but uh don't talk to me again in 10 months we'll see how this goes other questions yeah mike i have three things first of all i'd like to just say how grateful i am lionel that you've been a part of the workshop and for lowering the garage door and and let us let us see load us into your thinking and your in your note making system i i just can't tell you how much i appreciate what you've contributed to the workshop and and and letting us listen to you think i i it's been wonderful it's been a wonderful experience the second thing is is i i got two things from from from your presentation one is a big part of what you do is you trust the process and i think that's amazing because oftentimes when making my own notes i get lost worrying about whether i'm trusting the process or getting to the point where i trust the process you seem to have a good flow for where things go how things arrange it's it's just quite wonderful the other thing that i saw is is that you have an overreaching goal and purpose to write the damn thing and i think for for my own personal note making system i've been sort of lost there not really having an overreaching goal other than to make good notes and that's a little vague and i i think having an overreaching goal like that might be very beneficial especially to me so thank you very much for sharing your uh insights and uh and it's been great to actually interact with you thank you thank you very much mike i'm very very moved thank you lionel's 1000 page novels speak for themselves he can write but more than that what he just presented has the potential to dramatically impact a wave of future writers novelists and world builders mark those words and let's see where the world of linked based writers is five years from today as always there are a lot more of these inspiring tours i hope to showcase because they show how personal the process of thinking and growing ideas can be if you enjoyed this you know what to do share this gem share it on twitter share it with your writing friends and of course
