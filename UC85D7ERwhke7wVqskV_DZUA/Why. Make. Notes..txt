why do you care about making digital notes   like what are you actually trying to 
accomplish that's not an easy thing to answer   but it's worth thinking about it it's worth 
exploring i can tell you what the answer is for me for me it's so i don't forget things so 
i can make sense out of my experiences   so i can reference past thoughts as i write new 
thoughts so i can connect ideas across domains   and so i can develop those ideas across time so i 
can create and share those ideas across the world   even if it's just the world between my two ears   speaking from experience it matters how you 
set up your digital library so that it can   grow and evolve with you not just this month not 
just this year but throughout your entire life   that's a really powerful thing because if you 
can't rely if you can't trust your digital notes   you're one step away from digital dementia a 
digital library should possess the ability to   help you find what you're looking for when you're 
looking for it whether that's today or in 10 years   from now that's what it means to be future proofed 
future proof notes are not fragile they're not   trapped in some proprietary software that may or 
may not be around five years from now they are in   a format that can be with you no matter what that 
format is called plain text and as long as there   are computers there will be computers that can 
read plain text when you work in plain text files   that gives you the ability to keep your notes 
private that means no company can sell your data   your private information to third parties it 
means that no company can lose your information   to hackers who hack the companies that have your 
information the beauty about plain text files is   that you can keep them completely private locally 
saved on your own computer your digital library   should be a joy to use you should enjoy spending 
time with it it shouldn't be a place that causes   anxiety because it's cluttered and chaotic 
instead it can be a place of calm and serenity   a place where you have a sense of control where 
you can develop ideas where you can revisit past   experiences and memories this is the value of 
smartly linking your thinking the ability to   make meaningful notes across genre and throughout 
time if this resonates with you i encourage you   to save this video as a handy reminder on why
