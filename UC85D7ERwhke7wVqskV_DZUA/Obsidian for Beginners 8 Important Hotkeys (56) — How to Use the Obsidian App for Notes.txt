isn't it frustrating when the tools you use 
can't keep up with how fast you're thinking   one solution to this is the use of keyboard 
hotkeys i use them all the time in the   internet browser and different apps that i use 
it really takes your thinking to a faster speed   now when it comes to apps like obsidian knowing 
the most important hotkeys can really take your   thinking to the next level just as a reminder 
i'm nick milo and this is linking your thinking   where we talk about the how and why of making 
meaningful notes and this is one of the final   videos in our series on the basics of using 
the note making app obsidian let's dive in okay i'm excited to jump into the hotkeys 
so let's create a new note using a hotkey   i'll tell you that one later and let's call this 
the eight most important hotkeys in obsidian i'm   only showing you three now but you will see 
the other ones so the first one is open link   while you're in edit mode you've seen me do this 
already and it's a command click on the link i   think on a windows it's control i'm going to be 
speaking in terms of the mac operating system so   keep that in mind so let's find a note and we're 
in edit mode right because we can see this hash   now if we get out of edit mode which we'll 
cover then we don't see the hash anymore   we're back in edit mode so if i just click 
on this note it's like i'm trying to edit   it but once i hit command and then i click 
boom opens the note i use this all the time   super super powerful once you start thinking 
in terms of these links you need to be able to   use this hotkey so that's a command click so 
where's another one adversity paradox command   press command and click boom we're there okay 
let's now i'm looking on the side and let's go to   the next one so number two toggle preview so 
this is edit mode this is preview mode how   am i getting there i'm hitting command e what's 
really nice is this allows you to be a left-handed   ninja you just keep your left hand right on the 
keyboard hold down command and you can toggle   back and forth when you're in preview mode as you 
might expect it looks nicer but you can't edit   when you're in edit mode you see the you know kind 
of the behind the scenes formatting of markdown   and you can edit so that's number two 
number three open the quick switcher so   once you do want to start typing bring that 
right hand off of the mouse and hit command   o and that opens up the quick switcher then you 
can start typing whatever word comes to mind   i'm thinking note star but i can't remember it 
so i was like note and then n-o-s for whatever   reason and then ooh note star i hit enter boom we 
get taken to the note so that is another extremely   valuable hotkey let's throw in the next three 
boom number four search this is command shift f   see what happens here it takes us to this new 
pane we were at file explorer but when i hit   command shift f i just can start typing and 
in this case i'm going to type in for never and i can see the two notes populate immediately 
maybe i want to search for a hashtag so then i go   concept and i have these three concepts 
and i can see it was used twice in this   in this note one here and one here very cool boom that's repeat don't need that and let's go 
back now next hotkey okay so you start navigating   around and just like an internet browser sometimes 
you want to navigate backwards so there's actually   a hotkey for that obsidian is a pretty advanced 
app so instead of wasting real estate with big   back and forward buttons which will probably be 
some sort of plug-in later if you really want   instead the way to do that is to use hotkey 
in this case it's command option left arrow   left arrow left arrow left left left 
left left and just takes me back back   back same thing command option right takes me 
forward and that's number six two more to go   can you see how just a few hotkeys can really take 
your game to that next level final two new note   remember we were just going to new note we 
started this video series on new note well   if you can imagine it's command n that creates a 
new note so i just hit command n and i just start   typing and that's the title immediately 
it can be whatever you'd like it to be   then you hit the tab button and then just you're 
typing in the title so that's pretty nice how am   i going to get back to that old note i hit back 
boom i'm back and last part this kind of opens up   a whole new window of functionality so we're just 
hinting at it is that we can open a note in a new   window so what does that look like not a brand 
new window but a new pane so we command click   on a node so remember when we were in edit mode if 
we command clicked on a link it opened that note   in this pane but if we command click over here 
on a node let's see what happens command click on   this node it opens a new pane and these might be a 
little tight so in case you weren't aware you can   find the edges and drag these however you need 
to so you can see them so now we have two windows   and remember what i can do to see preview 
mode i can toggle that with command e here   is me toggling preview mode again now let's say 
maybe i don't want to look at red pill blue pill   so what i'm going to do is quick switcher what 
was that command o and i type adverse oh there   it is and i hit enter and i'm at the adversity 
paradox so hopefully you can see just how powerful   this application is especially once you know the 
markdown especially when you know a few basic   settings and especially especially when you 
have a few hotkeys at your disposal so if you   like this video and you haven't already please 
subscribe below and especially in this video   please comment below i mean these are just 
eight hot keys i'm sure if you have any   experience with obsidian you may have found 
your own hotkeys that you really really enjoy   and i'd love to see what those are below so 
please comment down there and i hope you've   been enjoying these videos guess what we're on to 
the very last video i'll see you in the next one you
