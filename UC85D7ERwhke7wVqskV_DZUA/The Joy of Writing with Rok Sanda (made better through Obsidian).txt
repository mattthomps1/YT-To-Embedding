where do compelling creative breakthroughs come from how can you be even more creative when the resistance is growing all around you roxanda shares what he did in this fascinating showcase rock studied english literature with an emphasis on creative writing at the university of east anglia in the united kingdom upon moving back to slovenia rock quickly gained acclaim for his historical plays winning multiple awards and achievements in theater as a writer and director he has also been running a creative writing course for the past nine years in the following rock takes us on a riveting writing journey along the way we will see if he heeds the advice to always listen to your characters and if his writing stays truthful perhaps most interestingly we will see in which random areas of life he drew serendipitous inspirations from inspirations that led to compelling breakthroughs let's join rock's journey now so using obsidian for writing fiction a humble example uh some of the things i'm gonna show you've already seen but other things are gonna be new to you guys so just anyway let's just head into it when writing you're always jumping between two modes write as you see stuff happen which is a fast process and look for connections find deeper meanings which is a slow one sometimes that process is straightforward usually it's not the problem with writing is this prose is linear thoughts aren't and not just prose but writing in general even screenplays or it's all linear writing is essentially guiding the reader or viewer down a linear thought pattern but it's your job to find that line having the right tool is essential it doesn't make the writing better necessarily but a bad tool will make it worse i've written using many different tools in the past paper notebooks words scrivener simple text files right monkey i've slowly been inching my way down the mark down line because if you see the last two are simple text files which are markdown friendly and right monkey is basically native markdown i like that it's totally mine totally movable and that it's future proof sure but the problem with all of the above is that they are all linear they can help me put down the end result but do they make me write any better no and then i saw the obsidian graph and i started playing with it and the graph started to grow the problem was i might have become too excited about the graph i wasn't doing much writing so but i had an idea i wanted to connect all of my fiction the stuff i've already written and the stuff i was still yet to write into one cohesive library where i could then make sense of it find new connections because writing isn't just writing even though that's the most difficult part of the process it's also the easiest in a sense once you get started you just well right but i have folders upon folders and notebooks upon notebooks of different ideas various connecting thoughts that aren't connected for example i have this trilogy of plays i've been working on and i had a great idea for an for an ending when i started in 2015. this was the idea part one part two part three it was all linear but then you write the first part and you have to change bits here and there because your characters want it that way and you should always listen to your characters which is a note i have so part one changed and then in part two there were different options option a b and c for part two which wasn't written yet i started writing the second part and the third part is now a multiplicity of different avenues so i've written the first part i've written the second part but the third part has got like at least 10 different options i can go down three of them are completely different plays so i'd have to decide which one i want to do and i've also already put the part one and part two on stage already and i've boasted about having a trilogy already so there's pressure on me to to make the third part people keep asking me where's the was the third part coming which one do i choose of the of the options which one is closer to the truth writing should be truthful that's another one of my notes because in a sense even though fiction is a lie right you're making stuff up but you're you're discovering a deeper truth in your fiction that's why even though i wrote the first play in 2015 and the second play in 2017 i'm still yet to write the third r third one i'm scared of tackling that pile of notes my ultimate goal in obsidian is to get a hold on that file tackle it into submission get all my fiction under one roof the linear and the non-linear stuff all of it that would be my capstone well getting just halfway there would be a success actually but that's not an easy thing to do so when i joined this cohort i quickly came up with a simple approach if i am to end with a good capstone project i need a beta project first and i had one of those never finished projects just waiting to be the test tube baby for me so here we need to go about half a year back in time my wife is a psychotherapist and she once showed me a poem written by dr frank oakberg a psychiatrist and a pioneer in trauma it's about a series of trauma cases he experienced with his patients culminating in a court ruling where the victims were denied justice because of a lack of evidence the traumatized victims testifying sadly wasn't enough for the judicial system that's what made him write the poem and when i read the poem i really felt it to the bones and whenever i feel something that deeply i need to create something i saw there was a film that could be made inspired by the poem someone narrating the poem someone acting it out etc so let's read the poem now because i've been flashing it a couple of times in the sprints and stuff memory shouldn't be memory shouldn't be shards of a broken dream secret pain shouldn't strain breathlessly to scream i know the where i know the when i know the who too well believe me or believe me not i have a truth to tell but mother if you cannot hear i'll keep your peace a day a year forever if your doubt and fear convinces me to silence your honor if the proof you seek is rusted lost too old too weak forgotten then i shall not speak dismiss my plea with silence it matters not who hears the voice once i have understood the thunder of the truth untold will echo in the wood and judges naked in the robes will shudder at the gate how thin the cloth of innocence against the chill of hate memory shouldn't be shards of a broken dream secret pain shouldn't strain breathlessly to scream i know the where i know the when i know the who too well believe me or believe me not i have a truth to tell by frank oakberg in 1993. i know there's something there i feel something but how do i show it to others i can see images but how do i compile them i first try deal with fashion weight just shove it into a screenwriting app and you'll figure it out but it just sat there for months i could see the film film but i also couldn't the problem was i mean i i could do that approach but i had so many other projects that uh this one just kept getting pushed back even though my mind kept going back to it i kept thinking about it so that approach didn't work and then i started working on it in obsidian here's my thought process let's start with a simple brain dump the old-fashioned way what do i feel when i read the poem what is it saying memory silence justice screaming shards broken dream destruction of self not worthy of love disorganized attachment which is a a negative attachment in psychotherapy and psychology being close to someone is something to fear youth child abuse and marital abuse those were kind of the thoughts i had when i was uh dissecting the poem and i slow slowly create a couple of new notes maybe something is there memory silence justice scream shards dream disorganized attachment which which was a note i already had that's why i wrote it child abuse then we had a light sprint random words nothing connected with my beta project theme of the year focus on the pro process tetris effect kitsugi deliberate practice caterpillar shadow gamestop hug and when i was later looking at my list i realized this fits in the hug so i put it in i opened up that note types of hugs maybe what about this thing that's a hug a self-hug we did it as kids as a joke look at me someone's hugging me hahaha but it's also such a sad image someone soothing themselves which is what a child needs to learn when there aren't any parents around or when the person that was supposed to protect you is the one who hurts you so this connects to unworthy love self-hug being close to someone is something to fear child abuse what do i see what are the images of this film a victim standing in the snow hugging herself from behind we see a naked back and black streaks across her back that's what i see and with her hug she washes them away let's go back to the poem what do i why do i see snow it matters not who hears the voice once i have understood the thunder of the truth i'm toad will echo in the wood and judges naked and the robes will shudder at the gate how thin the cloth of innocence against the chill of hate how thin the cloth of innocence against the chill of hate there it is the snow that's the snow it symbolizes the innocence it symbolizes the cold it's both at the same time it's renewal it's a blank slate slate like a child i start writing a couple of scenes not the actual script yet just to get the mind jogging on the ideas a figure is wading through the snow witness 17 with a heavy coat of dark red she's struggling as she walks in the deep snow the background is a duality of white and black it's a forest filled with vertical lines of spruce trees carrying heavy loads of snow the red coat is a cliche but that's for later ignore the internal editor when writing the first draft onward you lazy piece of asterisks the witness stops in the middle she looks at the trees she drops something in the snow whatever she drops sinks into the deep snow like an anchor into the deepest ocean only a hole remains the witness pulls snow from her sides and wide swinging motions to pull snow into the hole to bury whatever is there as she does this we can see wings forming in the snow to her sides as if she is the snow angel embodied and then she drops into the snow on her knees she's crying something is wrong she wants whatever is buried she wants it back it's something i can work with this what is she burying in the snow is my next question and i go back to my first list okay youth what about youth another one of the light sprints that's when we did the youth note and when i was writing i started digging into it i've written a lot about youth actually about how trauma is transmitted from one generation to another how it never ends until someone ends it intergenerational trauma like in wars my trilogy is about that actually the father in the first part is an aspiring aviator building his own airplane from scrap when world war one erupts the battles of essenza if anybody knows his dream of flight is destroyed by the war deformed as is his self-worth his positive attitude never to be destroyed is now destroyed and he abused that feeling into his son there's this poem that started the whole trilogy it's what the father's ideology was in the beginning and the sole reason i named the first play icarus never forget thy fall oh icarus of the fearless flight for the greatest tragedy of them all is never to feel the burning light by oscar wilde reinterpreting the icarus myth not as a cautionary tale but as a source of wonderment how far we can fly if we only believe but his son is not the accursed reborn his father kills himself in the frenzy of revenge and the sun carries his rage into the next generation he becomes a phoenix forge in the fire of rage as world war ii rages in the background the phoenix myth wait wasn't i working on memory shouldn't be film how did i end up here intergenerational trauma trauma youth the wings of youth endless possibilities taken away by abuse and that was in the script as she does this we can see wings forming in the snow to her sides as if she is the snow angel embodied so the wings were already there in the in this in the in the in the text i've written it's already there a victim standing in the snow that's what i uh wrote before hugging herself from behind we see a naked back and black streaks across her back and with her hug she washes them away no no wings of youth she pulls those dark lines into wings she can be reborn and she slowly stands up and she's and as she stands her coat slides to this white snow revealing her naked back and the back the smooth skin what should be sensual is filled with hard lines black lines covering her back like lashes from a whip or bruises of beating or cuts from nails all at once black as violent bulging a scar tissue and she stands tall among the spruce trees naked in the snow her back revealed to the world and she moves her arms into a hug she hugs herself like we all did when we were kids and it looks like someone else is hugging her and as she hugs she pulls at her bear back and the painting slowly morphs from lines as she slowly loosens her hugs and her hands move to the left and right of her back the lines morph and smudge and as she finishes her hug with a sudden pull the lines are now more like wings black but smudged and smooth like the surface of her skin and back to the pawn i done something but that's not enough the beginning is such a strong statement memory shouldn't be shards of a broken dream shards so i go you know definition hunting which is something you do when you have no idea what to do a broken piece of fragment as of pottery or glass okay zoology a tough scale or covering such as the electron of a beetle that there's a there's flight there but i'm not sure it doesn't work i think not yet anyway a mirror could be broken into shards a mirror can be a portal to a different world it could be a way to see yourself to reveal your scars so i created a note about mirrors but i wasn't sure if it would go anywhere i go to my friend deviantart a wonderful website to get inspired this is what i find crack a smile and break into tears such a strong statement and such a beautiful image like portraying something something in the poem something in the person i don't know perhaps the vix victim also carries a mask a broken piece of herself something to hide behind not sure yet there's something in the hiding shards there can also be shards of ice shards of eyes that will melt in the sun okay shards of a broken dream eyes broken dream there's something there what about pottery it could be a piece of pottery that a child has created for her mother one of those ugly things from clay did she bury that her youth a flower blooms from the crack no not a flower something simple green a healing yes a healing so i type out the ending the woods are less snowy now it's almost like spring is coming there's greenness in the white and bright colors the snow has melted away from the clearing the four is still looms the trees still harass but they're receded by the green a small pile of snow remains and next to the pile there is something a piece of pottery a cracked ash tray and on it a faded heart through the cracks a strong green stalk of grass is pushing upward towards the sun as all around shards of ice are melting into oblivion i found the ending shards of ice melting into oblivion oblivion being the healed memory it's a start but there's a there's loads more in there the poem is so rich with meaning hold on the light sprints hold on hold on theme of the year focus tetris kenzugi deliberate practice shards of pottery what about kenzugi and so it goes as kurt vonnegut would say you could go on and on and on that's the joy of writing made better through obsidian that's the end of my presentation seeing rock's process is a joyful thing isn't it he shares a really fun example of how the process of creative writing isn't linear it's a helpful reminder that inspirations can come from places you'd least expect you just have to be open to receive them so now let's give rock some love in the comments below and by the way rock's showcase is the 10th showcase i've been able to share on youtube out of well over 100 showcases from all of the linking your thinking workshops there are so many more people i hope to showcase to you because they show how personal the process of personal knowledge management can be so thanks for tuning in to this showcase and until next time stay connected
