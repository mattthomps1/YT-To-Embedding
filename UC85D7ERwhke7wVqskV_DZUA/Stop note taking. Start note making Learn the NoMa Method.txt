foreign to the second all-time linking your thinking conference we're in for a wild four days thank you for joining me if you don't know I'm Nick Milo a founder of linking your thinking the whole purpose behind this conference and its predecessor is to get really interesting people in a room together so we can start talking and learning from each other so the Noma method Noma note making insights and minutes that last a lifetime the Noma method is about note making because note making gets you leaning forward there are two ways that we can approach knowledge one is sitting back where it's coming in at us and we consume it this is what happens when we go on a binge on Netflix if we if we still do this and we watch too much we get overwhelmed overloaded just all this noise coming in that's sort of note-taking note making is where we stop leaning back and we lean forward it gets us engaged in the world of ideas around us and this makes all the difference it sharpens our thinking and it gives us intellectual assets so the process of note making is actually going to give us something each time we do it that's a nice side benefit and guess what everyone you are already doing it you are already doing it the only difference is you may not be doing it effectively enough in the world of the linked note in the age of the linked note so with that in mind we are going to hop into that a little bit more first what is note making let's set the scene a little bit more what is note making there's no taking and then there's no making so if we look at note taking that's where we quickly capture someone else's words and the key there is there's somebody else's words it's a passive action and it's oftentimes driven internally if we really are true with ourselves by a fear of missing out on something it's a mentality that has a scarcity mindset we're worried we're going to lose something visually we're shrunken in hoping that we don't lose this little thing but when we do that is an acronym easy in Easy out the stuff that comes in easily is not going to be retained it's just going to go out just as easily now let's contrast the note taking with Note making let's see how that will look no making these are notes that are mindfully made they're in your words and it is an active activity sometimes when I say this it feels like common sense and I really hope that five years from now we finally as a society move away from bad note-taking habits that were drilled in US in a lot of our upbringings and move into something that is truer to how we interact in our day-to-day lives by making by engaging by being active overall if there's fomo with note taking the process of note making is Jomo the the joy of missing out you're okay to block out some of that noise because you're in on the action that matters to you Mimo so this is what's beautiful about no making as we'll soon find out mindfully in magically out when I talked to end Laura later I think we'll really get into this magically out part because I do want to make sure that we all chew on this idea that when we're note making we don't always know what's going to come out but we will generate something what is inevitable if we do it long enough is that you've increased the surface area of innovation of creativity you've given yourself an opportunity to create things that you would have never imagined note making is the act of investing in yourself it gives you linkable assets and linkable assets linked together they build over time they form things that we don't even know what they're going to be sometimes they can easily become our own intellectual assets that power and fuel our career and our creative Endeavors I really want to make a point clear here sometimes you know why you are note making you want to share what you're writing with other people but just as often you don't know why you're doing it you just feel something you feel a spark of curiosity and if you've given yourself permission and I if you if you need permission here is permission explore those Sparks explore those trails they're going to lead to something oftentimes profound not in the next minute but maybe in the next month we just don't know that is the beauty of following our own interests no matter the reason though note making is the act of investing in yourself okay so we have 10 more minutes what are we going to cover in that time the Noma method itself this will power everything you do hopefully for the rest of the sessions this week if you get those repetitions hopefully you keep doing it after this week the Noma method itself is a simple way to make insights in minutes that last a lifetime insights and minutes that last a lifetime so here it is in only five five prompts now in in some of the other activities we do in the workshops we go more into different exercises and plenty of different prompts but this is the Noma method in five prompts first you need to be a thing finder notice when you say this to yourself that's interesting hmm that's interesting you don't even know we don't even know we say this half the time but notice when you do that's when you've found something a thing and it's worth exploring it's worth making a note on so that's number one whenever you see that's interesting the note making method can start but instead of clipping that interesting thing instead of collecting it instead of highlighting it even you say that reminds me that reminds me and this makes all the difference it takes you from a note taker to a note maker if you remember nothing else remember and work on this phrase that reminds me it will get you into an active mode of thinking that reminds me of a thing of an experience and what is this what are we talking about right now if you could type in the chat you might say that is a connection that is a link that reminds me of a thing we've just tethered two things together if we want to recall something this is how we do it then number three it's similar to that thing because so this is similar to that because it's different because so this is really allowing us to be active and parse together the differences parse out the differences between things and then last it's important because this is tough something Sparks with us we don't always know why it's important but this is an important question an important prompt because it gets us answering and really understanding why did we single out this signal versus the rest of the noise why did we do it this prompt gets you to really check in with yourself why did I do this why out of everything out there I chose to focus on the term combinational creativity as we'll focus on in 18 minutes with enlar why why is that important guess what that's it and we can't take it further like I was talking about there are plenty of other prompts some of my favorites are left off including the personified prompt but that's enough to make insights in minutes that last a lifetime just those five things we'll review them one more time but to repeat you are already doing this just maybe not in a reliable way that can build idea assets for you if I capture things here this is great this might be enough but if I want to build ideas that can grow interact connect with each other I may want to use a Next Generation thinking tool but that's up for you to decide you can always do the note making method as you walk around wherever you go regardless if you have a screen in front of you or not all you need to do though is to think about how you can make a note and Link it and what is the key prompt out of those five prompts the key prompt that reminds me that is it you might be asking okay what should I note make a map about and I can tell you well there are about 13 things that come to mind and they all happen this week so let's explore those right now if you are making notes why not make a note on the Noma method and you say well this method reminds me of something else that's what you do you say it's similar to that thing because it's different because and it's important or it's not important because and then I would say make a note right now combinational creativity is coming up in 15 minutes make a note right now have it ready with those prompts and then instead of note taking during our conversation you'll be note making and then right after that if you don't already have a note on zetel cost in and on light lyt what is it exactly well we can find out through a note making process five prompts that's it and you'll really accelerate everything you know not just today but now you have those you have these notes that you've made actively that you can always link to everything else in the days weeks years to come Wednesday the cultural tutor she and Quirk comes on you'll have a note at least one I guarantee you something on culture and then edja is going to talk about scrantal and tools for thought and then we have Yolanda Gibb on ambidextrous creativity that seems like a pretty good note to make something on that is definitely a thing that I say that's interesting Thursday we have Peter Rosso talking about thesis writing we also have a research Roundtable we'll definitely cover collaborative Knowledge Management what is linking thinking all about link notes and we'll do that with Bianca Joel Joel C and Maggie and then we'll finish Thursday with Mike vardy talking about time crafting it's always easy when there's something like time crafting one of these nouns because that is a thing we can grasp it it's a concept it's a handle that we can grasp onto make it a new note and go through the five prompts of the Noma method that is what we do on Friday Joy Capone is going to come on to talk about laws of creativity his new book so pretty cool I think I mean this is a beautiful book everything that Joy does is is just a work of design art and you'll definitely find at least one law of creativity that you'll want to make a note on Priya Mohan is going to talk about design thinking strategies in stem definitely want to check that one out Danny Hatcher extended cognition and then I'll finish everything up that Friday with something I can't tell you right now it is redacted but I'll reveal that word on Friday and hopefully tie everything together so for each event do the Noma method and remember take a screenshot right now all you need are these five prompts whether you are at the grocery store or in front of your computer that's interesting that reminds me it's similar because it's different because and it's important because those are the five prompts of the Noma method if the Noma method could speak it would shout the best time to plant an idea is yesterday the next best time is now I am looking forward to our upcoming events so until then stay connected and I look forward to hearing how the Noma method works for you [Music]
