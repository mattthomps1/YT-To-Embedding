for many people block reference is a killer 
feature a superpower it's what allows bruce banner   to become the incredible hulk but is that always 
a good thing sometimes it is sometimes it's not   but before i get into my hot take on 
block references let's explore this   exciting new feature in obsidian just as a 
reminder i'm nick milo and this is linking   your thinking where we talk about the why and 
how of making meaningful notes let's hop in   i have made a new note with today's date block 
ref test i've made a couple sentences this is   me testing out block reference let's talk about 
the mental squeeze point so that's another note   i know there's a nice paragraph block that i can 
use here so let's start with an embedded reference   to the main block of the note so starting from 
scratch even though it's below i'm just going to   explode it with an exclamation point bracket 
bracket so that's the notation then i'll do mental   okay so it auto completed i'm going to arrow 
down to it so now with it kind of highlighted   in the arrow down i can hit the shift six block 
references like you know it's a little bit more   to take in so just keep that in mind this is an 
advanced use you certainly don't need to use it so   i can hit shift six which will insert the carrot 
now it's looking at all the blocks in that note   i'm going to choose this main paragraph note 
that i want to use and let's see what happens   cool so the carrot changes to a hashtag and it 
gives it this hex identifier so i really don't   need this for reference anymore now if i go into 
my preview mode let's see what this looks like   okay let's go check out what the actual linked 
reference looks like for comparison so it gave   us this little paragraph now if we open the 
link here's what i'm referencing and i'm in   preview mode here when i hop into edit mode notice 
what's at the very end so the program has added   this little hex code the six digit code with a 
carrot so that's the basics of a block reference   now let's look at other ways that it can be used 
a regular link to the main block would look like   this so what's the in edit mode if i just if i 
don't want to embed the block reference but if   i just want to link to it same thing i'm going to 
type in mental okay arrow down to it in the pop-up   and then i can hit carrot which is shift six and 
then i can go down to the thing that i want to   reference hit enter and boom there it is and so 
when i go into preview mode no preview because   i exploded it here but we can still link to it 
here click and there we go so i click back okay   so why does the carrot right now i have pulled up 
why does this convert autocomplete to a hashtag   and for my limited tech knowledge this is so 
every url that you create let's imagine that you   want to use obsidian publish all of these urls 
are maintained so there's complete consistency and   you've been able to use obsidian publish to block 
reference which i guess is pretty fascinating when   you think about it okay so that's the basic of 
block reference now let's just explore a couple   simple use cases i know that you'll have a lot 
yourself these are a couple that i just kind of   ran into that i thought were useful so if part 
one was the general use of block references in   obsidian now we're diving into some interesting 
use cases here's something that's kind of neat   about how obsidian is handling block references is 
you can actually choose what the the code is that   references it all you need to do is add a carrot 
so let's explain what i just said because that   didn't make sense while i said it if i go to let's 
go to sources and we're going to dive into let me   make this a little bit easier for you we're 
going to dive into this research paper on   willpower so this is something i took notes 
on a long time ago in zotero which is still   a great app for collecting research article 
pdfs so we're scrolling down and we get to my   extracted notations so these are highlights in 
a pdf that i've extracted into markdown now it   exists within obsidian so if we look at one 
of these paragraphs i want to focus on this   anterior cingulate cortex as a part of our brain 
that's involved in behavior regulation and it gets   exhausted when we use willpower so let's explore 
this paragraph so i want to reference this note   in the note called flow i just want to put it 
in somewhere what would i do how would i do   that i go to the end of this paragraph this block 
i make sure that there's a space between the last   character and then i hit carrot and then i can 
type in whatever in this case let's just call it   cognitive and then robinson for the last name 
of the first author and i could put 2010 if   i wanted a date what i'm trying to get at here 
is i've just created manually a block reference   that is actually descriptive it's descriptive 
to what it's showing me and maybe i put an a at   the end just to kind of give it some arbitrary 
numbering system so this is pretty cool and it   is now a block reference why that's important 
is because i decided years later oh i want to   reference this in my note on bean and flow not the 
best example but you kind of get it so now if i'm   in this note i want to look at this title which 
is source and i give it a date and all that jazz   so let me explode because i want to embed this 
bracket bracket it saw that i was looking at this   so i can put this oh put that note in 
there i'm going to backspace hit a carrot   and now what was that in neurocognitive okay so if 
i go down in neurocognitive terms cool if we look   at what that reference was cognitive robinson 
2010 a and we can see it's referenced here   so if i go to preview mode we can actually 
preview this and if i click on the link   it goes directly to that block and that's that's 
one of the powers of block reference so if you're   used to my other videos this is way more advanced 
you don't need to use this feature but it does   provide some value if you know what you're 
doing and you really need to reference blocks   i want to show a little bit more of a paired 
down example of referencing blocks using obsidian   just today i was on twitter and i found something 
kind of cool so i want to open up something i saw   giovanni okay not that but giovanni said something 
about block references and i want to quote that   in my personal knowledge management system so 
you know he says here i use obsidian for this   type of use and he says something else so i'm 
just going to i know there are better methods   to extract things from twitter this is a manual 
method just copy text i go back and let me just   paste that text in which i just re-pasted in and 
let's say this in particular this block i want to   reference so i just go to the end of it and uh i 
hit carrot and i hit a one that's it all i have to   really do is hit a one doesn't have to be a unique 
identifier because what we're identifying is the   text so the i use obsidian so now let's go to this 
actually my script for this video and starting   from scratch if we want to reference blocks 
like quotes and tweets and here's something from   giovanni that i want to reference let's start from 
scratch i backspace i'm going to explode this note   which is the date today's date it's my daily note 
if you will now let's hit carrot and i can look at   all the different blocks in this note so let's 
just explore what that means that means this first   title block is right here then the next one tweets 
from giovanni is right here web here i use i use   and they are they are so we're looking at all the 
blocks i just think that's kind of interesting and   something important to kind of break down slowly 
so we can digest block reference because if i   backspace and hit hashtag which is the header 
level reference so instead of a block level   reference it's header level let's go back to that 
giovanni note the daily note and now we see just   the two headers are referenced so hopefully you're 
getting a little bit of sen of a sense of how to   link out these different levels of reference you 
can link pages which is just that or we can go   to the header level and link to one of these or 
now we can go to the block level so it gives us   this great flexibility in what we can do almost 
too much sometimes but it does give us flexibility   in this case i'm going to block reference what 
giovanni said about how he uses obsidian it   autocompletes to hashtag one because remember i 
put in the carrot one so now if we go back to this   hit preview and we have the quote right here we 
can link back we can click this button and boom   we're looking exactly at what was referenced a 
couple extra notes on block reference we can do   global searches now so if you hit let's see 
anywhere let's go here and i go bracket bracket   instead of just hitting the caret once which 
is only searching this one file if i hit it   again now i'm searching all the blocks in 
my library which you know that's insane   but you can do it if you know exactly what you're 
looking for and same thing now with headers so we   actually have the header functionality as well 
and i can search all my headers that works a   little bit better for me just another interesting 
note in version 0.9.5 we can now search headers   outside of block reference there are two things 
in 0.9.5 that are also worth mentioning which   is now there's a command to if you're someone 
who uses a lot of uh checklists you know you   have that one and this one this one so now you 
can just go to whatever note you're on and hit   command enter to complete it that way so it's a 
really fast way to toggle your your check boxes   and finally the community theme has been restyled 
so this is just something instead this massive   image where you really had to scroll now we can 
see a lot more a lot more easily and i think it   does scale so yeah so if you zoom out you can 
see three at a time depending on your screen   size you'll probably see two at a time which 
is a little bit more helpful so those are the   basics of block reference in the new version of 
obsidian 0.9.5 now let's go to the conclusion   so after we've gone over this preview where do i 
sit well i'm not sure block references are game   changers for me but that could always change with 
a little bit of time it is an incredibly powerful   tool that we now have access to in obsidian so 
i guess in that way i feel like bruce banner   deciding whether or not to go full hulk mode do 
i want to link atomic blocks in an overpowered   hard to control and potentially fragmented way or 
do i want to stay in bruce banner mode and keep a   sense of control over my thoughts and my abilities 
to articulate ideas calmly as with most things   somewhere in the middle the truth lies so on this 
more than most things i'm extremely curious how do   you plan to use block references in obsidian and 
hey as always if you got something out of this   video please give it a like and subscribe 
if you haven't already and please comment   below i really want to know how you'll be using 
block references in obsidian until next time you
