are you an academic or researcher struggling to balance what you read versus what you write how do you strike the right balance between note taking and note making in the following showcase bianca pereira shows away bianca is a researcher in computer science with an interest in knowledge graphs data semantics and engaged research during her phd studies she discovered how easy it was to quickly create a mess of research notes so in this video bianca will show how she created a complete academic workflow to facilitate her process of knowledge creation while also showing the links between her work and the academic literature from anti-library to notes to knowledge creation and to output let's view bianca's process now the workflow itself the academic workflow is my capstone project so i'm still slowly building that so i'll try to do an overview and then maybe after we can have more conversations because our time is very short today so based on that uh the step by step that nick has showed before like capture extracting development creation i try to kind of like map what are the things that i have been currently doing and i still have many questions many open questions so the first thing that was interesting for me especially from the conversations in this course is like how can we capture our sources because when you're doing research or academic work our sources are very important and we want to keep a link of them and organize them and everything before i have a mess in evernote like as we all have now i'm trying to divide these things i have two concepts that are called the library and the interlibrary so for example if you see those books that i have here they are mostly my auntie library which means like things that i have created and i say i really have interest in reading them they are good quality but i haven't read them yet so they are on the things that i will study where the things that i have processed that i have had thoughts about them i took notes they become my library so i have this concept when i work with research and it's important to have an inbox where it's just where you just throw stuff that you saw like ah this paper may be interesting you put a small note and so then i'm trying to this is to unorganize it in my case so i use evernote and pocket to to do the inbox and after processing the inbox something is going to the interlibrary and when i decide okay i read this paper now then i move that into my library using obsidian so i have here one uh folder which is for files and i put all the files in there so i have like people i have invoices that have papers here so after having those things in obsidian i do a backup always with everything is synchronized with my google drive so i always have this on my phone or other computer and then comes the process okay now that i'm i'm reading that whatever do i get the pdf which i can read on my phone i don't know how to pronounce shadow or preview on mac and i have different colors of highlighting meaning different things and then from that comes the first part of extraction which i do in obsidian so one example of is this note for example so i have some bibliographic information rather than having text i have a big text then i put what is the pdf document so you are able to see the pdf here and then the original source my summary some analysis something that i was trying to do today actually i don't know it's true enough you know what is the idea of embedded queries okay i don't know why it's not working now it was working two hours ago maybe my query now is just i just look like this so basically what it does just showing the back link so you can see all the notes that have linked to this specific uh paper so i would like to have the extracting the piece here but so far is just like the words that appear in the context of the link but i can still pass the the mouse on that basically the same thing that they have in the backlinks but i think it's good at some point they say okay this source where where where it has been and what is it so basically you just put as you are you are putting common block or like code block and you just write query and then you write query as you would write in this so you can write you can use path file tags lines you can remove things i was trying for example i don't want to have my my daily journals for example so i just say i don't want anything with the tag journal so my daily journals don't appear anymore so maybe i don't want my sources as well so i can just that's what i was trying but it didn't work i don't know i don't want my source now it's working so it do not appear other papers because i all i tag them always source or you can say everything that is in i just want things that are in this there are in this folder so there are multiple ways to to do that i think and here i just put the pdf so that's one of the things and what i do the same thing here i put as an elias and i'll show later when i talk about latex and publication why i try to do that so as i read and i was creating my notes i i have always the notes in my thoughts in the note itself of the paper and i already move into my what i call my knowledge graph which is the knowledge base itself where the same code may appear in different notes depend on the context and with some comments about that but they always appear in the original one as well then uh in the development stage something for people especially who write the questions we can write latex equations in obsidian okay because it has method mathjax which is a javascript library that parse equations so you can have those things in obsidian and then after if you want to write in latex it's much easier because already in latex um and then some of the things that i found i find important when working on my knowledge base in obsidian is the idea of keeping history because when you are talking about moocs we say we collide the the thoughts we just break notes into delete notes and the deleting part was really hard for me because you want to keep the history of things and that's where i was finding the the comment from the disco in the discourse uh from ujj and she was like but i say things just in case but our just in case is really because we care about the history how how was this thought constructed so for example especially when you're doing data analysis from the from inductive perspective so it's like more bottom up so rather let's stay with the final version and throw everything away i will have just one note which is not even none of those which is just the summary of my results but for research you want to say okay in the first stage my raw data in the circle stage how did i analyze what are the results and the link with the original raw data and then stage two how the did i cluster those things how they relate to the original so all those things have links unfortunately i cannot show them at the moment because it's still not published i would like to but for the capstone i'll create at least an example so you so you'll be able to see how i do that um so yeah then i think that the idea of moocs or the emergence is like if you are doing deductive research it's good to start from moocs or something more high level then you go breaking down on what you're trying to do and the inductive is always good also good but keeping these links all the way up and then after having written everything marked down in obsidian then the last step so i say like i create a mooc with all the ideas per section of the paper that i want to write let's say introduction those are the ideas which was something i was talking yesterday and then after i can even write each section of the paper itself as different notes in obsidian and then i can transfer them into overleaf because overleaf uh for for those who use latex i don't use words i never write papers in words i'm against writing papers and words because formatting is really hard in word so in latex you just have you just change the template which they usually come given by the conference and you can actually just import your markdown files so basically having markdown files you use package hybrid markdown and then you just import them and then you just say mark the input and it says the name of the file and then when you recompile to generate the pdf so i have this note here it's just narrow mark down i just took from obsidian and and uploaded so the introduction and then what happens here my introduction is there on the format of the conference the subtitle important point the same thing and then i need to check through the equations okay i put like a episode equation here and as it was already in latex it already appears here so there are still a few things like you cannot use the media wiki type of links you need to use the normal markdown links otherwise it doesn't work there is a trick also to put the images here you just need to have one piece of uh in the original latex and then to show the image in the two columns one but i can share those things with you in this course later like how to write them and there are still many open questions like how to create a good environment for the for the mobile because we don't have obsidian i don't want to have all my notes in the mobile but i would like to to have the nose directing obsidian and yeah i still have many things to talk about well i suppose my time ago seeing bianca's whole workflow shows what's possible for researchers using obsidian why is that so important because she shows how you can powerfully use plain text files at the core to research and create knowledge that you can grow into a research paper a master's thesis or even a phd dissertation bianca shows how the researcher can cultivate a healthy balance between note taking and note making as always there are so many more fascinating people i hope to showcase with you because they show how empowering and personal the process of thinking and managing knowledge should be what did you like most about bianca showcase let me know in the comments below and until next time stay connected
