obsidian is not just another app to compare features with yeah it's a thought acceleration machine very cool yes it's a tool for thought broadly speaking yes you can use it as a commonplace book but it's so much more but if there's one thing you can expect from me it's not to dwell and focus on the what an app is is to focus on the why and how of making meaningful notes because that's what the true value is for you so while my beginner's guide to obsidian free on youtube shows you what obsidian is and how to use it it never loses sight of why you would want to use it in the first place like pat riley of the miami heat it keeps first things first what obsidian is as cool as that is matters far less than why you would want to use it i share my reasons in the video called why make notes but i'm curious why do you want to make notes please let me know in the comments below and as always stay connected [Music] you
