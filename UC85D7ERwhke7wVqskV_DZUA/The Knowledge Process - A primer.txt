hey friends it's been a while i just wanted to quickly share something i've been pretty excited past few days thinking about this so i just wanted to share it with you and kind of get your feedback on it and let's see where it goes so switching over to i wanted to show this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody but this is the pkm planet it's a really good way to think about the stuff that we do with knowledge i'm not going to go over it now because there's a different video for that that um that needs a sequel it's long overdue for me to do part two of that i'll get to it but i've just been kind of excited lately thinking about information so there's information let me get a pen real fast hold on so there's there's information and then there's you me whoever and there's kind of this flow but very quickly we think about it as a cycle we there it is info it goes to us we process it we do things with it we express ourselves and that that goes back into informing the type of information then we receive after that so it becomes this feedback loop for now let's just call it the knowledge loop another way to look at that is we encounter things out in the world and we end up expressing things encounter express encounter express it's this back and forth thing this is another knowledge loop but the question is is that it and if you were a 1500s farmer in rural france maybe that was it for most days now in the 21st century a lot of us who spend a lot of time wrestling with ideas because of this whole knowledge creator economy whatever you want to call it but now that we live in information abundance this isn't it at least for the majority of people in the world this isn't it we need something more and that brings up a famous quote that between stimulus encountering things and response expressing things there is a space there is a space between these two things so the same space exists here in our 21st century world and always it's always there for us and what is that space it's thinking now it's very simple on this map but if we just make this loop a nice little circle now what we have is we encounter things sometimes we go right to expressing we're reactive but other times we have a moment we create a space where we can think and a lot of value can be made here other things happen on this cycle that i'm not going to cover now but that have me very excited and so this is that same pkm planet remember the thing i was just showing over here we can see that same thing where we encounter new ideas over here and we express them over here so collect knowledge write package share stuff and in the middle is where the thinking happens don't cheat the middle this is where you create value the most values created here along with some here um we don't want to cheat this out so let's go back to the map one more time and i will wrap this up so what does this all mean this pkm planet actually it's hiding something more and that is that there's a knowledge process in fact this is the knowledge process we encounter something and we express ourselves but in between we think and that's what we're doing as an acting phase and there's actually a separate phase i'll cover another time that guides this process kind of in the subconscious lands it's not all subconscious but most of it so once you know this knowledge process once you know how it's encoded it becomes clear how to improve yours and i think that's really empowering i think that's really empowering just as though just when i first encountered this concept that between stimulus and response there's a space meaning that we don't have to be reactive meaning that we can get out of this rat race between encountering something and reacting to it we can actually create space where we think where we generate ideas where we organize information and this can grow with us sustainably over our lifetimes so we can provide more expression more value here which will change the type of encounters that we have which will lead to hopefully richer thinking and we have therefore created a loop a process that's very positive nurturing and enriching for us that's the idea i could talk about this for longer but i think this is long enough and uh let me know if this meant anything to you or if it's just a bunch of random scribbles and ramblings i would do more like these if you think that they're valuable but i'd like to hear from you zooming out [Music] there it is all right
