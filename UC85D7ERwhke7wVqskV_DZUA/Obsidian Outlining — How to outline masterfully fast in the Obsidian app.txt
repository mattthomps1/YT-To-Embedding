that was the dry run i'm so ready to do this it's crazy are you recording everybody good everybody good okay well the strength of obsidian is that its basic page encourages you to write and think it can also flex its outlining muscles as needed within the very same file this outlining and brainstorming functionality has been increasing through the latest updates and that's what i want to show you today i'm going to show you how you can use folding swapping lines indenting out danting moving whole sections quickly i'm going to show you how you can do all of this to accelerate how you brainstorm how you outline and how you write prose all together as a reminder i'm nick milo and welcome to linking your thinking where we talk about the how and why of making meaningful notes let's go what if i told you i filmed all of this yesterday without recording my screen true story now the best way to show you how to outline and fold is just to show you the note my script for this very video here it is right here it's blown up a little bit i zoomed in for you this was that introduction i just gave a version of it off the cuff now i'm going to un-twirl this so what is that that's called folding and i can also click this ellipses the three dots here and that will unfold and i can refold i can twirl up or twirl down so twirling folding it's all the same thing how do we activate this you go to settings editor and settings editor and then we're going to find the fold fold heading we make sure that's toggled on and fold indent we make sure we toggle that on as well now what does that allow us to do well side note before we go into that we can also fold lists in preview what does that mean that means if i fold these lists hold on just a second i didn't auto fold but if i fold these lists as such and then i go back to edit mode and i go back to preview mode we have the folding in preview mode that remembers wherever you left it and that's quite nice so if i untwirl hotkeys and i toggle to edit mode and then i toggle back it remembers that so that's a kind of a nice feature and same thing we can also fold headings just as easily in preview mode and it remembers that okay now if you press the three dots those ellipses we can unfold and we can always fold unfold here as well i kind of prefer this just because i can toggle it that way but wouldn't it be nice i don't know if i didn't have to hover my mouse directly over this to get a quick fold or unfold well let's explore what we can do there and that is a hot key called toggle fold is that the official name so if i hit if i search for fold okay so toggle fold on the current line toggle fold on the current line so toggle fold and now i've mapped it to command 3 and i'm going to explain why later so what can i do with that well if i just click my mouse quickly over here then i can hit command 3 and start to toggle fold that i can toggle fold this that allows us to quickly collapse information expand information as needed now what did i skip fold all headings and lists i can do that and i've mapped it to command option left now on windows that would be control alt left left arrow so if i hit that button everything collapses and then i can start from the top and kind of re-twirl down the information that i need and same thing i could do that again now if i want to unfold everything i've made it command option right so if i hit that button everything unfolds and then there you can see all the content that i may have had hidden and that is folding and folding is step one on the trail of becoming masterful at outlining and brainstorming quickly so in the next section that we're about to unfold we're going to cover more so these hotkeys that allow us to outline at the next level of speed and this is a lot of fun if you're like me somebody who came from you know microsoft word and evernote you don't know how to program or code you don't know specific modes that allow you to quickly do things with the keyboard this is a simple elegant solution by the way happy january 20th 2021 okay i mean here it is this is how to outline masterfully fast okay unfold boom i hit my hotkey let's set up the folding hotkeys let's pair this with indent and out tent now i unfold that see i just hit the same hotkey i unfold it that's how fast it happens boom boom right i'm sure you know about indent right you just wanna make sure the cursor is over near the start if you're in this app and then we can indent we can indent but did you know just as easily if you hold shift and then hit tab we can outdent an outdent pretty nice pretty straightforward now if we can highlight both we can indent and out dent both at a time so this allows us to work very quickly now i can go back up here i could fold this but i'll just keep it unfolded now using that same hotkey let's unfold this pair this with swapping lines up and down now i can tell you when i hot keyed swap lines up and swap lines down a light bulb went off because suddenly i could really outline as fast as i wanted to basically as fast as i felt comfortable thinking so maybe that was like 30 miles per hour but to me it felt like i was blazing so here's how this works if i highlight this line i don't even have to highlight the line but if the cursor is here i've hotkeyed this to command 1 and command 2. so i'm going to going to hit command 1 it actually unfolds anything that's folded but then it's moving up and same thing and i'm hitting command two i'm going to put it right back make sure i go back to where it was pretty awesome right i mean this is really cool because i may have decided and i did while i was doing this i wanted to show you indent and out dent before i showed you something a little bit more advanced which is swapping lines swapping lines up and down so where i had this before i shared it with you is that it was like this i had swap lines up first but then i was like no i need to introduce indent out dent first so all i had to do was highlight everything and then hit my command 1 command 2 and then boom it's there i love swapping lines why because when you combine this with kind of some of the stuff that we do with mlcs where we're mapping the gaps we're shifting links so quickly it allows us to work in this really fluid flexible creative critical connective way that really unleashes i think what i would call our best thinking now i want to pair this with one more powerful and simple tool and this comes from a third-party plug-in by argentina and it's hotkeys plus plus and this allows us to quickly toggle through list types unfold and we're going to toggle to bulleted or numbered list that is what it's called and so i'll show you what it does and then i'll show you with all of these where we can start to program our own hotkeys so this is command i've mapped it to command four so now if i just have my cursor somewhere on this line and i hit command four all of a sudden this is changing all right so let's just kind of break this up a little bit and so if we do that now they're all unordered lists now you say but they're all ones how's that going to render if we go to preview mode though there you can see one two three four so that's quite nice let's just get rid of some of this and put hotkeys back to where it was and then i can indent and there we are if i want i can fold that back up can you see how powerful this can be outlining masterfully in 15 second recap starting now okay now we can fold headers we can fold uh parents in a list we can indent we can out dent we can swap lines up and down and now we can make numbered lists into other types of lists by simply doing the next one and then we can do that as well so that is all this functionality that allows us to quickly quickly quickly did i say quickly outline and all the while we can do it in a note that allows us to write in paragraph write in prose at the same time now taking a step backwards i want to explain why it's so important to become a left-handed keyboard ninja and what do i mean by that it means that i keep my left hand on the keyboard and i keep my right hand on the mouse as much as i can like if i'm navigating around i don't need to type things i want my right hand on the mouse the only way that works if you want to take advantage of some of this amazing functionality is if you make proper hotkeys so you have to really think about this and that's where i've had some deep experience assistant editing and editing tv shows where i would literally lose sleep at night because i was thinking about how best to program the keyboard with hotkeys that allowed me to work really quickly and if you have any knowledge of the entertainment industry then you would know that the majority of tv shows are not made on final cut pro they i mean there are reasons for that i won't go into it in this video but what we use is a software called avid media composer and you better be able to program your keyboard you better be able to set up really good keyboard shortcuts and so i'd spend hours lying in bed at night trying to figure out the best way to make myself as fast as possible as efficient as possible and a lot of that same mentality has now come into play here so when i set up my keyboard shortcuts i wanted to think about the moves that i make a lot within this app and how i can make that happen more quickly and i also don't want to make things too complicated so i just kind of want the basics and now if you like to outline if you like to brainstorm quickly then these do become the hotkeys that you do want to map to the keyboard to allow you to be that left-handed keyboard ninja so let's hop in we go to settings then hotkeys and let's check fold so the first one i want you to do is if you can try toggle fold on current line and the reason i do command 3 is it's right above command e command e is what toggles us between edit mode and preview mode and so hey if i already have a toggle feature i'm just going to move my middle finger up one row and now i'm toggling the folding of that line so that works quite nicely for me now if we go to the next ones swap lines these are the next ones i want you to hotkey so if you go to hotkey and just search for swap and then we can see right away swap line down and i have this one but what i want you to do is customize this and consider making it command two and command one all this allows my left hand to do all the swapping while my right hand clicks on whatever line is necessary so i can be right here and then i'm swapping down swapping up very quick very fast and lastly if you do install hotkeys plus plus which i can show you where that's at community plugins and you know make sure you can browse the community plugins eventually you can make sure it's activated here hotkeys plus plus that allows you now to go to hotkeys i'm actually going to hit plus to search that way and the one you want to look for is toggle to bulleted or numbered lists and so you can see here i've made it command 4. again if you're on windows that would be control 4. now that allows me to quickly make these into well here let's do this so now immediately i can make those into a numbered list let's see what that looks like one two three four five quite nice right now for the most part i prefer just to not number unless it's very explicitly needed also side note before you tell me that these features existed already in vim mode or in emacs or in whatever app that's fine that's cool what i want to show though is a simple way to do it for simple people who don't know the advanced stuff and that very much includes me i hope this helps you become a super fast masterful outliner and left-handed keyboard ninja and that takes us two additional features so let's unfold additional features and it's the export to pdf functionality which is pretty cool it keeps your theme so if we're in the cybertron theme i already did two exports and the first one will export my colors which i don't quite recommend so i'm going to show you how if you are using cybertron or anything that's sort of dark mode you might not get the best results so what i would prefer to do with this exact file like hey you want to share this with somebody you want feedback you want to keep a pdf copy whatever it is send it through email so let's go to appearance really quick and i actually have adam and i'm going to go light mode this is a theme by cognizi let's see if i can pull it up yeah it's right there so this is a nice one if you want to export to pdf on the fly so i just quickly change it and then under more options here it is right at the bottom export to pdf and let's go ahead and export i'm going to save it on the desktop and just give it three now let's see what we have i guess it pulled up just right away so this is what we get doesn't that look quite nice everything's unfolded obviously and we have all the information there for someone to look at that's pretty cool it's just nice to have this functionality and now it exists within the obsidian app and that takes us to the conclusion so i'm going to unfold it so you know what this is great for both note taking and no wait a second that's out of order so i'm just going to highlight this or i don't even have to highlight it because it's one block and i'm going to move that where it belongs that should go there all right let's try this again this is pretty helpful standard note taking but outlining in this way is equally helpful for note making and other creative works for example this video as you can see in this note was crafted using a note that was over 50 percent outline so we have all of our outlines here let me quickly unfold all that we have our outlining here and it's actually sandwiched with a bunch of pros with a bunch of paragraphs here that's beautiful they coexist together in the same note so you know what it's actually great for both note taking and note making if you're a student especially you'll dominate with folding with swapping lines with indenting which i'm sure you know and outdenting toggling through list types very quickly fluidly seamlessly and overall becoming more of that left-handed keyboard ninja i hope you got something out of this video if you did share it share it share it share it and i think if you're watching this video then you're probably the type of person who knows somebody else who would also enjoy this video share it with them also if you
