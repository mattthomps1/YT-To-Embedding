essan nurseology is an iranian-american product designer that has helped over 13 hardware products get to market he is the author of why do we interface and has worked on designing interfaces for the internet of things augmented reality 3d printing financial tools and medical devices and prosthetics he grew up in the chicagoland area and now lives and works in san francisco in the following mega tour that includes a massive question and answer essan gives us a sneak peek into his considerations during the design process i'm sure you'll agree the way he thinks about solving problems is both fascinating and empowering let's view essans presentation now there's this project i did in the middle of quarantine so published this august 15 called wider interface and it's sort of this narrative style analysis of design and technology and how they come together and i sort of called it a micro book and as you can tell it sort of has some ideas that are a bit inspired you know from older technology or a little bit of physical books and a little bit of of things like you know that are a little more interactive like obsidian right like as you hover over here you get a preview so when i worked on this i didn't know about obsidian and it didn't exist when i started this either because i first gave this as a presentation in 2018 and so this is like a presentation i gave at a really small meetup and i felt like oh there's something more to this presentation like i can turn this into something more than just that little presentation i gave and so i started this in 2018 got to a certain extent didn't know what my ending was and just sort of got stuck and that's been a common theme of mine is like i'll have this really strong beginning and then i'll get stuck and eventually during quarantine you know there's enough time where you just started sitting at home frustrated that it was a good way for me to channel my energy into something so i use a tool i can share it but i use a tool i mentioned this to nick uh called readymag that makes it really easy to design your own website a lot of people are familiar with like squarespace but think of this as like a website builder where you can like literally move anything anywhere and since i'm a designer and like pretty familiar with web technology it's like pretty easy for me to do this and i have like decent ideas the hard part is for me i think to like have this cohesive thing all together so once i eventually figured out that obsidian is this thing i realized like i wish i had written it in obsidian and that it felt really tedious to go and try and make it remake it and obsidian from scratch because i was like sort of almost done about to publish it when i sort of figure out sitting as a thing and so i didn't end up doing that but what i've been working on during the course is the open socket micro book which is another project i started as this readymag site really polished and i talked about this a little bit last time so i'm sort of recapping a little bit but i want to jump into i think this is like essentially copy of what i shared when i last spoke and i sort of had these sections and i had these like different little notes and things but it wasn't quite coming together and there's this archive of like the linear version that i started with so similarly like i put together this like linear version that looks ultra polished like it could be a real thing but then it just sort of ends at a certain point and i think i shared that last time so i'm like oh let me put these in obsidian and like just pull them apart into different notes and do that and i thought i was going to do that and that didn't work like i didn't get anywhere and so then i did eventually i wrote this one which was like a brainstorm of like all the reasons right i've been trying to write about this like reasons why the open song project i worked on failed ultimately and i want to share sort of those lessons and help people sort of avoid some of those mistakes but also like take benefit of the good things we've figured out right because there's some good things we figured out and it's also a way this is like a very emotional thing so it's also in a way for me to like come to terms with it also so it's like a mixture of like journaling slash writing lessons for someone else so that's trying to get to something i can share publicly that's the whole goal here the whole goal here is sort of jumping back and forth here this organization made by our bump the website's made by bump we essentially shut down this site in 2014 so there's like this content here and we're paying for this and we have to stop paying for this eventually and so it's sort of this thing where like we gotta stop paying for our dropbox we gotta stop paying for this squarespace site we gotta we gotta like close the chapter there and all this has made me think and like learning about obsidian has made me realize this concept of thinking about like how long should knowledge last and so this is something i spent a lot of time on thinking about like you know just going through my own experience with like things like evernote and google drive and dropbox and dropbox paper and pocket apple notes like just realizing during quarantine that i'm scattered so thin across all these different things and it sort of just like accumulates over time and like you know nix i think talked about this a bunch i think a lot of people have sort of experienced this but this was a stream of consciousness consciousness consciousness note that i wrote one day just in obsidian because of the value of like just sort of going around and again i thought like oh i can turn into a blog and i didn't quite get it to that point yet either but it it spurred me on to this idea of like okay what i really want to do is create this open socket micro book it's these lessons that we learned and i sort of start to write it out okay it's been like seven years since this shutdown and we stopped working on the open socket and like all these are little notes let me do uh i set up a keyboard shortcut option p that lets me pin the note it makes a lot easier to sort of like fly around like okay here's bump here's open socket um this is an idea that like i've thought about a lot it's just like we need to be better discussing failure like in silicon valley and tech they talk about oh fail fast but i don't feel like they actually talk about failures they just sort of like encourage you to be messy so that's i feel like a misuse of the word almost it's almost like encourages you to be irresponsible rather than like learning from failure um and i i came up with this term micro book that i talked about and then where really clicked was actually i sort of went back to a more traditional outline but what it let me do is because i'm trying to prepare this for public consumption it starts to feel pretty natural so let me switch to actually the uh obsidian website so you guys are seeing the obsidian website right so what i've done here is i've like modified the theme like gotten rid of the header gone rid of the sidebar just to focus on the content here not uh get confused with my like home notes here so like traditionally i would have like a link to my home note here but i sort of removed it for the sake of like confusion here so this is i think a bit of what nick was getting also with like the the challenges that you maybe run into when you're trying to have your own notes versus public notes i started i've started sharing this site with my collaborators my co-founders where that we worked on this together and it's been really helpful for them to see this and so to demo this a bit more i'm starting to piece together how the site could be and it could essentially be very much inspired by obsidian and obsidian publish into what the final outcome might be and it sort of further lets me lean into this idea of a micro book that i started with the why do we interface where i don't need to get so caught up what happens when i try to write a linear narrative i always get stuck but it's much easier for me like to write these little notes um right since so like none of these are long and this first one why website matters this started as like a little journal for myself but then later i realized like oh this could actually be the preface um that's like establishing it for other people um and there's like some standard things okay i need to give some background on the material this is less interesting for me to write and it's less of like a lesson but some like background information probably some of these are totally messy right now and they're not really ready uh to be shared but like let me get to a good note um okay so this is one that i wrote recently where it's like a mixture of a journal reflection an insight an anecdote and like a lesson on like working with press all-in-one and it's like a few sentences and like if you read this in total isolation it should work assuming that you've like read this like first page and so that's sort of what i'm hoping that this can lead to is i haven't gone there yet but what i want to do is essentially you're seeing like these things these should all turn into every section should look like this when i'm done so it should just look like a table of contents but what's powerful about obsidian is i'm working in the table of contents uh sort of as like a what we called like the um i call it hub but we call it uh the map of content so it's sort of funny this is actually like the first note but it's more of the intro to the project and then the map of content is like the second doc inside of that and then these are my notes or brainstorms i've had that i essentially haven't gotten to so these are sort of my to-do's it's like a really lightweight way to do to-do's but it's not to-do's because they're just like ideas and i might abandon them if i don't find the inspiration to write something or i've often been combining like three or four of them into one before i like essentially write one of these and so there's like a lot here and so let me let me get to one other one um so this is like a good example where i'm like linking a bunch of other notes so what i'm hoping to do is actually make a lot of these shorter as i get closer to the end and link a lot of them together so i'm trying to write these like the openstack project was incredibly ambitious because i want to use that in another doc like later on and i haven't quite figured that out but i'm trying to really make these atomic to really encourage that sort of fluidity of me writing it but also people reading it so for someone like me who struggles to with that narrative and like going like the the intro beginning you know building up to a climax and a conclusion ending i'm finding that this is much easier way for me to sort of like chew on ideas find figure out the insights get on the page um and maybe at the very end come back and do that so that was a bit of a quite a ramble uh and i'm and there's a lot more content here to sort of like click through but that's the sort of like off the top of my head pitch of what i've been up to okay wow okay so first off let's do our digital round of applause yeah no this is this is great um i mean this this is why i i'm just so i mean if there's a silver lining to the pandemic it's it's meeting people that are on the this call and everyone else in the workshop it's it's just so inspirational in different ways i think there's a lot for us i hope you can keep sharing your screen because i do think that we'll have some questions for you um and so yeah maybe we just kind of open the floor up i'm just gonna say i appreciate you kind of going through your process of where you've gotten stuck how you're trying to move things because then i it sort of helps me think about are there projects i would want to present in the future what are some of those sticking points what are some of these good ways that you're outlining of having um sort of these light to do's of of what you want to work on in the future without it being sort of that irresponsible messy uh process you were talking about in the beginning but something that is a little more intentional and structured um so i just really appreciate kind of getting to see how you went from point a to point b thanks yeah i think i i've struggled with it i think a lot of people struggled with this of like do you tag a bunch of things to do or like how do you do it and i i feel like for me the most important thing is like being able to see everything so these little tricks of like putting this in preview mode and pinning the the dock and like being able to do this and i've this is a theme that i've like modified for myself that's like it really helps me focus on like side by side like just like two things and if i like want to like get the stock and the other one i just you know know the keyboard shorter to open both and i sort of like go over and like edit them and a funny thing i think one of the things i struggled with the most as using obsidian as a writing tool was not having any sense of safety in terms of versioning but i just paid for versioning the other day so let me let me uh go to like uh this doc and edit this i don't know if everyone has seen this um but this this this is what i think was like the key missing feature that i needed to fully feel comfortable with this right so it's just like i don't think it fully sync like this but it got the edit um and it has this like version it saved last night and there's that i just made at 5 29 p.m so like that's what gives me i think the comfort of like fully working in here to play around with my ideas and not worry about like making backups or anything like that i think if i go back where did it go i think it finished backing up yeah so now it has to edit this um so i think that's going to be huge that's uh am i right that's through obsidian sync yeah exactly so they just released obsidian sync it might be not the public version of sydney it might be the insider build but yeah that's like their built-in where you pay obsidian four dollars a month and they sync the everything for you we were just having some conversations about sync and and the versioning is kind of that under i don't know if it's underrated it's just when you think of sync you think of you know between devices and versioning is part of sync though and that's i have to remind myself that because that's extremely valuable yeah they uh when i went through it earlier today and read the obsidian post on the information about sync that versioning they they keep those versions up to a year and then after that i think they start rolling off so that's about i mean a year is a long time but you know if you need to go back beyond the year it might be something to think about or something yeah for me i think i'm typically trying to go back a few minutes or a day or two i think it's really about me like copy pasting content and moving it around and being able to like tear things apart and build it back together that's where i don't need to worry so much about these things because when i talked about here i had [Music] this first draft these are like the linear chapters you know not uh let me open up a better one these are not written in this sort of atomic style this is just like how you would imagine writing in like a word doc or something i felt like it was although it was nice visually to write an obsidian like this i didn't have any of the security that i have with a lot of other tools where i can do comments track changes anything else so i was sort of missing that comfort to just like edit this whole thing in obsidian it was almost uncomfortable as good as it is in editing small things it was bad at doing this so that's why that version gives me that comfort of like oh i can freely edit this because i don't need to worry about losing a good idea right so one question i have and if this is not the right or proper analogy then you can just dismiss my question that's perfectly fine but did you draw any inspiration in in developing this micro concept from andy methusek's website about evergreen notes absolutely yeah definitely from that from what we've been learning in this course from just the way obsidian is structured but also there's there's books i've read they're business books and so like they might not really be relevant for everyone but there's a team called uh um or the book is called rework and it's by this company called 37 signals so it's like a really bold business book but i i read it years ago and i always loved how short it was like each section was there's no fluff to it you weren't reading these like huge chapters you just like read a page or two of this like insight that they have and that always stuck with me and then recently i read another book i think i write about it in the micro book article maybe i i don't oh i think i know where it is uh this is where i'm like on the spot but uh there's this book called silence in the age of noise um so yeah the thing i really like about this is that he is essentially reflecting on what is silence 33 times it's like as if someone wrote 33 journal entries on what is silenced to him uh and so i really really enjoyed that that book and and you see like i tend to keep my personal notes like uh really small here i'm not trying to build a wikipedia for myself here i'm really trying to build my own ideas so for this book it was just like a way for me to talk about it but this this book is a phenomenal book and there again it's like each chapter is just like you know two four pages most maybe one page for a lot of them i think there's a few reasons why i like it because it's it's very readable but it's also a lot more approachable for me as a writer that's not very good at writing books to try and imagine that i might be able to write a book one day if i if i keep it like that one of the things i was struck by andy mathusa's website is i you know was interesting and fascinating and and mesmerizing but i always had the sense that i had to wander around which is is good and cool and everything but what i like about you what you're doing here is with this micro book is you're you're going to invite me into your website and you're going to curate your links like nick has been saying and you're going to guide my attention and and give me a course and path through what you're trying to say and do and i i think this is very impressive i i i really like what i see here thanks appreciate it yeah i think i think andy's uh site is really cool i don't think it's trying to even be a cohesive thing i think that's the beauty of it his i think this is a little different i think i might do other projects that are like that about like design in general but this is to me uh a case study so how would you do a case study case studies tend to be linear in their sense but if it was linear i would maybe lose this you know ability to like um capture like this insight like a pretty bold claim like why you should always charge money for charitable you know services and i sort of like have this like you know basically saying like you should charge it even a dollar or not even charge it but ask it encourage people to to contribute if they can and just even asking them that question and getting them to think about it will sometimes get people to turn down even if it's a totally optional contribution and so there's just these like various lessons we learned along the way that at least for me are a lot harder to turn into a narrative and so i think yeah that that's why it's so appealing as you guys can tell though it's still very overwhelming because there's still so much here and so i think i made a lot of good progress i took a week off during thanksgiving and i made a ton of progress that's where a lot of this is coming from and then i sort of like i sort of hit a wall again another wall and so i think i have to break past the sec this new wall that i've encountered again but i'm trying to do it by i've started to share this like i said with some of my former co-workers who worked on this and that discussion and like that feedback is what's helping me sort of like break through i hope this this next phase yeah this is this is phenomenal and i really like how you're you're explaining your process to this is a personal thing like you said and there's there are emotional attachments so it does make sense that you know when you have these sticking points one solution is to talk it out with with people including those who are involved um i really like really like how you have the intro and then the intro leads to um to a table of content to an moc a hub note um quite independently um the light kit ended up having something similar because i think i started to wonder well how can i provide somebody a soft landing point you know like somewhere where they can get a sense of their bearings uh without being overwhelmed and you know so so i think what you do it really does that on a very high level and then when they're ready they can jump in and see like okay now we're here and and then how you have your categories laid out pretty naturally at the start right we kind of have these there's a sense of um chronology we go preface introduction and then we go kind of more topically and maybe that is still um in the path that is chronological or maybe not you know at this point you would be the one who knows best but it's it's just really nice to see another thing i'd like to also say is i love how you're going from you know this is your to-do and it's all sort of in front of you and then as things get tightened they become just the link and it's just a very it's i mean the things that you're doing here i find that i jive almost 100 percent with you know how i've been working as well and it's it's just kind of great to see this inspiration thanks yeah appreciate that um yeah as you're seeing it it is sort of that chronology um and some of these things i'm not sure yet if they'll they'll live on and i sort of get stronger again at the end here um but for example um why website matters or embracing everything should be a remix or how long should knowledge last actually have nothing to do with this project but they are my own things that i've been putting in obsidian as like part of this i think goal that we're all after of like building knowledge in the tool and then i sort of realized like actually they're very related to like why i want to do this project in the first place um uh here here is where i forgot here's where i wrote about uh silence in the age of noise it's like everything is a remix and embracing everything as a remix like sues the ego a little bit like you know don't worry so much about like what's your idea or like where you got from somewhere else because like i definitely prescribed to this uh idea that i think kirby ferguson sort of at least that's where i learn it from he basically shows you how historically everything in music is remixed way more than you you think it is and then he sort of goes on to show how it is in movies too and how just ideas we think they're our own but they're not really they're just sort of like coming from different pieces of inspiration i watched every one of those videos it was fascinating yeah so i mentioned auntie annie matushak here as well and sort of all these things i mentioned i sort of different memory uh and then i did it here and that's another thing i can mention is that um why do we interface so if i pull this back up again it's very it has a lot of references uh everything a lot of links that are two references but when i did this i did it entirely free of any tool meaning it wasn't from bookmarks it wasn't from evernote it wasn't in obsidian i literally wrote this based on my own concept because it was a presentation right presentations you don't usually like reference things so heavily but there were things that i remembered that i had read or influenced me and i basically pulled them together even books that i had read so there was like literally things i had read over years or like stories i had heard about like the apple newton so there were things that i sort of like put together this narrative in my own head and and sort of wrote it and then val did it that i was like actually right by going and finding the right things i was thinking of or doing some new research but i wasn't i think the benefit here and this is still with this tension is i wasn't worried about going and finding all these sources and then making like an obsidian note documenting that i know this piece of thing exists i like wrote the thing and then i hyperlinked it all together which isn't maybe the most rigorous academic way to do it per se but i think the challenge right as soon as it happens and i think nick has been warning about this a lot is like as soon as you have the ability to put it all in obsidian it becomes it can become overwhelming so i tend not i never make i never will do something like this oh i'm just like oh i want to come back and make that a thing i will never do that if i'm not ready to write something about it i don't want it to be a thing i don't want there to be any noise about like things where i like want to tag it i i found that obsidian search works well enough where i i never need to like treat these as tags if it's not something i really want to put knowledge into i don't i don't do it interesting yeah since i like brought that up the other thing i could mention is so i thought that there would be a bunch of like um spin-off things i would write about after why do we interface and then then that's also when i started realizing that obsidian exists so here i had this idea that i could write about interfaces that press you know bias and extract and i haven't gone really far here and i think it's a bit of because i got overwhelmed of thinking i do need to start documenting everything i'm learning so it actually just became a dump of these links because again i'm sort of lazy and i don't want to come make all these different notes for all of these things and so it's just this really long thing which maybe it's better than the alternative of making 100 notes here it's just like one note and it's just like a a bunch of things that are maybe related to this topic if i ever come back to it i think what's more interesting is my own writing here like i wrote about how i feel like zoom oppresses you and i sort of reflected on that or um you know thinking about nostalgic interfaces um so that's i think where the real value comes from never really on on writing about how something exists but we'll see my my big question is how will this be for me how will obsidian be you know uh 50 years from now that's sort of what i end up writing in here is like it's sort of a critique of rome and how there's all these like rome believers and like rome believers believe in it for five years to me five years is useless five years doesn't get you anywhere like i don't wanna i want this stuff to last a lifetime that's my answer for how long knowledge should last you see the your design way of thinking which i hope design is giving it enough credit because it it encapsulates quite a bit is what what's apparent to me is that it's allowing you to answer to ask to ask i should say the big questions big questions that have a lot of implications around them and then you start to to chew on how how to answer those implications there's a lot there's a lot to digest here but what's really standing out to me is that you care about your unique interpretation to the ideas you encounter that seems what is paramount um less so with sourcing um you know like you had said and i'm probably similar in that boat um is you know you're not so caught up on sourcing everything perfectly i'm trying to get better on that just you know to show that it is possible but i think my natural inclination is to do a little bit less because i want to get into why i care about it and then go in that direction the the the interesting thing though is when you actually are creating like that piece online and other things i would my my i guess my thesis here is that the work that you do outside of that piece it's it's like um you know when i was playing sports i would do the same repetition thousands and thousands of time edds they were called everyday drills and so i was drilling this into my muscle memory so in in the moment that mattered i did not have to think about it it came to you know it was just there and in the same way i think if we drill ideas by you know working these these thinking muscles critical thinking muscles but creative thinking muscles when the time comes and you want to create the piece it's just coming it's coming from that repetition that we might call intuition and it's coming there and to feel to fuel and feed the products that we end up actually creating and it gives it a natural flow and a natural energy that may be absent if we just try to link and embed these other things that we've created and may actually you know remove us from a flow that we might receive and that's the thing that is you know the art of link curation it's the art of creation from the work that we have compiled don't have all the answers but it is a fascinating liminal transition between what is captured what is what is written and then what is uh shared yeah definitely it was it was always helpful for me to hear you play back a bit of like what you saw here um because i think one of the things that we probably all ask and why we enjoy this workshop is like am i doing it right uh i feel like that's the question of like am i am i going to get to the goal right and like because it can be it can be really overwhelming it is for me like the messy middle part like having a vision of what i want it to be and then you know having these bits and pieces of something that's good and then like it's not all ready especially when i'm working on projects that i want to share um which this is one of them um and this this one it is a project where i don't reference a lot of other things i need to find my own source material that's like lost in our dropbox like folders and things like that so it's more it further makes me think about like this question that i have like up here where it's like hard for us to answer some of our own things from our own experiences even though we were there i it's i don't remember uh hey eslan i have a question about um the are you using safari or what are you using right now to display this oh so uh right now i think what you guys are looking at is my custom theme on obsidian okay yeah uh there's some like menu bars in the side got it yeah i hit i hit it all the way i like to work like this where um you know i can pull these up and have it here to be honest i don't know if i find them that useful like sometimes this is interesting but uh i tend i think this would be more interesting if it showed me the connections between the nodes and it doesn't do that uh unless unless there's a way to do that you know i know i can like show more of more outside but there there is a way there is a way yeah what's the way show neighbor links um and filters perhaps is that where it is neighbor links ah see that's that's when you don't know if you're doing it the right way that that could make it a lot more useful for me yeah i was really interested in the fact that you got rid of the you know like a menu bar and the graph and everything on publish just to make it a really clean um like clean user experience it's almost like you get lost in essays or digital notes per se um you know like when you get lost in people's journals um it's just a bunch of papers loose papers and that's the kind of experience it gives me which is really nice from like um you know like if i'm coming to get some of like a song's like brain like i want to really get in there and think about it and think from what level you probably be thinking of um but it was just interesting how you got rid of the the rest of it and i think part of it now is just like it's the extras noise you know if it's not necessarily clearly delineated like if i can't intuitively understand it why have it there um and this is really great yeah yeah definitely i think that's a bit of yeah i initially had it here and i'm still like i actually you know what a big reason was where a bit of a tangent a bit of a reason i stopped writing uh was i started messing with obsidian publish uh theme and i was trying to write this my own css to be like can i make this work and i spent way more time trying to figure out some css things and i just got stuck i literally this is the only time i've ever like spent so many hours on something like that and not figure it out but it sort of sucked away my energy because that's the easy thing i always find right it's easier to fiddle than it is to like make progress so i found myself just fiddling with the publish theme but definitely i think i i agree with you where i like had it more on the default and i just sort of like didn't realize why i didn't like it like i thought it was really cool to have the graph but i didn't like it um and i think you like worded well as like it just felt like a lot of noise and i think what's really nice is actually these i think these are really nice um you know it makes it really easy to sort of get to other things i wish that this was the default behavior in the software um that they were like just at the bottom here and i could just like click on them um versus like needing to like open up this screen and it's like a lot you know like this is still to me not nearly as nice as like the web version inspired by andy's annie's notes that's funny i think it's like no that part that you like to me it's like i want to get rid of it on publish like i think that's noise on mine so it's fascinating it's really cool yeah and you can get rid of it i don't know how technical you are but i haven't tried but you should be able to get rid of that pretty easily i don't know how to edit the published side of things i'm uploading my obsidian [Music] obsidian.css form while i publish it but i don't know if there's a specific publish one i'm supposed to yeah so you can um basically make a new file um uh did you do no i'm going wrong thing so like basically it'll reference publish.css so you just need to publish a css file called publish.css uh and it will read that and that's how i've i've gotten rid of some things i just duplicate it and call it publish that css and then fiddle around with it yeah perfect yes and you saw how i removed i removed that footer thing pretty easily yeah i saw that thank you hey one more thing do you know how to get adobe type kit fonts on to the css that's exactly what i spent hours on god i'm trying to figure that out it's like i hate looking at a header font for my whole obsidian like i'm getting into it but i really want the various weights right now yeah that's i spent so much time trying to figure out the font thing and uh someone told me they had a solution i tried it i just couldn't get anywhere asked in the chat i haven't figured it out yet all right well thanks this is this is great feedback though for the devs and i think i'll do my best to remember what was said we have the recording and then try to give them some feedback because i'm sure they want to make you know users like us on the call very happy yeah that'd be great i think i think there is this thing where like if i'm just trying to share my notes publicly what they have is great but if i want to try to make like a little packaged site it definitely i think needs this like custom font just a little more custom look yeah it gets it gets a little harder because on the fonts on the computer you just install it but on the web you need to sort of serve it somehow but it would be amazing if they had it for me it would become worth eight dollars a month i think as is i don't know if i have many uses for it so so if we were going to summarize the obsidian publish with wish list here say that again like a obsidian type kit or type what are we talking about um i put it in the chat adobe type kit fonts it's for those who have um like a creative cloud account and you can um upload fonts through there if you wanted to and there's free versions too like google fonts is like a free version where basically it's a cloud served fonts because essentially when you load obsidian for example on your computer it reads fonts off your computer and when you're on the website you need to load the font from somewhere if you're trying to use a different font i see so so fonts um that custom css set you did you you got rid of this side well both sides and you just got ready got rid of the header yep and the footers you could say now you you also showed how to showed us how to get rid of those the links to this page the link dimensions so is that easy to do i mean i'm going to rewatch the video to see how you did that but yeah it shouldn't be a lot of this stuff isn't too bad if you sort of know your way around css so sort of like find i think it was a markdown note published container backlinks like i i have enough familiarity with their css to know like that's pretty unique and you're seeing that it's like highlighting the right thing on both as i do that and i just did a display num which is my favorite css line to write i'm not that good with html and css but i know how to tweak css that's already there so from from that you can you know it's funny i would always open it up in something like bb edit or just another text editor but you can just edit on the fly apparently so that is a temporary edit so that's like a preview so i didn't edit my css that just edited it in browser and as soon as i refresh it it lost that edit gotcha yeah so it's like right click inspect brings up like uh it lets you live edit the css but it's not saving it anywhere yeah you would have to go into your text edit file i highly suggest getting visual codes and and searching through it through there um yeah it's free on microsoft visual code is that vs code like the one that everyone it's kind of standard okay that's intimidating but i'll give it a go yeah so my my current plan i think is to keep editing here but then at some point i want to invite my probably my co-founders to also edit if they are interested and that will be another challenge of they'll probably tell me which ones they want to edit or like just copy paste off the website um and then i think we'll end up eventually probably in a google doc probably because there's just so much there but i don't think i could have gotten here in a google doc this would not have been possible to i think do uh this way in a google doc and then probably because i already pay for ready mag it doesn't cost me anything extra to make a new ready mag site and so i do think i'm going to make it probably here where i have full visual control what i don't get and what i sacrifice by doing it is how cool it is to like basically fly through notes like this so i'm still sort of like figuring that out like i think this is really compelling it feels like a micro book web style thing which is a lot harder for me to do like that but the question i need to sort of figure out is like and i'm going to look for other things like how can i make knowledge this lasts the longest i don't i don't fully have that answered yet question about again sort of getting outside of what you're presenting um so i'm thinking about like if you were to take all of your different projects your knowledge library would you have like a portfolio somewhere or a personal landing page of just here's how you get to all of these different products um or do you feel like that's too much like you'd want your knowledge library and other writings to be separate yeah good good question i'm sort of figuring that out i forgot i i've been using brave which is better for privacy but the one site doesn't load is my own portfolio website oh no um let me load up chrome it opens up my y2 interface website but not the font i used on my portfolio website so this is my portfolio website so i'm a product designer this is how i get my like my jobs like this is how companies hire me um and so like i have you know these projects here um and like i can show you guys like a picture of like the open socket project i i worked on so like these are all here and um i have these like subtle links and i have another the first writing i did ever that was like really public was this one this is my master's thesis a bit dated now this is a squarespace website um so this is sort of what got me hooked on sort of like making content and sharing it that's like in a novel format and layout this i think got like 130 000 visitors like the first year was out and like 35 000 visitors and like the first like day it was up um by sort of like getting on reddit and and these things um and i've been trying to sort of see how i can do that again but it took me this was 2014 so then like years later right i did wider interface and that got like i think it's gotten like 13 000 visitors so far so not even nearly as close but still like decent but as i'm getting ready to publish and why the interface is linked here as i'm getting ready to publish open socket micro book i i am thinking that i want to redo this page to feature my writing first and then these other um like portfolio projects and like the portfolio projects i can open up one of them um you get a sense that these are more like traditional case studies and like one of the drawbacks is like it is sort of slow because it's like sort of heavy uh but it doesn't matter because like this is my personal portfolio page and it's like really heavy because i have a ton of like things in here um but these are meant to be just scrollable and things like that i'm really getting off on tangents here but i think like to answer your question is like the dilemma that every designer always has the joke is that they always are remaking their portfolio and then as soon as they make it they throw it away this has been around for i think two years mostly but as i write more it starts to be less meaningful because it's not capturing that work well that's good to know i like haven't really attempted to do like a version of this and i do feel like trying to put in things like if it was a professional project a personal project my knowledge library that definitely feels like too much in one place and so it's something i'll have to think through but i think that's useful to see how you've laid out uh what you have there and then maybe what you will put in in the future yeah i just have a little like aside to say with that one too um having a place that's like a link tree or a link page is a really great thing and i wanted to ask i don't know if anybody knows this right now because it's something i was curious about um but like traffic can you track traffic to uh like your publish um because if you can do that um that would be kind of fascinating to see um how much how many people go jump from one place to the other to get there okay um and then another thing is tracking between i'm wondering if you can check between pages if it's just one um static thing i i'm really curious about that you're talking about like obsidian publish right yes yeah i think that's one of the weaknesses of it is that you can't inject code at all like that would also solve the font issue um so i think in order to track that unless they build as a feature you need a place to basically inject code and as far as i understand i don't think you can do that yeah i do know that some sort of google analytics integration is is something they're working on i know it's a privacy thing that they're trying to figure out yeah because i think once i'm sure once you open open something up for code that that allows other things to be um accessed potentially so i think they're trying to work through that but this is a couple months old info at this point and you know we know how fast they work but i think they're they're supposed to have some sort of you know analytics because that's been a big request from you know published users and one of the things i will say the the beauty of obsidian publish and the reason why it is appealing to me even though maybe i i'm not sure if i'll use it or not is you don't get caught up in fiddling right here i filled with this so much uh and i'm happy with the outcome but i don't recommend it for any everyone because i i think for most people here i would probably recommend obsidian publish over ready make unless you're like comfortable designing stuff even though that's simple because these things can definitely be like a rabbit hole if you made it this far bravo you have enriched your thinking what's something you got out of this cement that in your mind by commenting about it below if you enjoyed this you know
