[Music] mixed feelings about using tag metadata do you use them to help you build mocs actually create a grouped page yeah so i think that's something that we need to explore a little bit in in the workshop go through and guthrie sorry i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly but i will say that the cleanest safest way to think about tags right now for you would be just what would your major tags be and and how would you put them in one of your home maps so you know this writings moc which you can find online to check out that might be a good example a thought jogger of just how can i use these judiciously like sparsely without going over overboard too soon any ideas on separate vaults i often have ideas that come up during work meetings yeah totally you don't want to work uh mix work meetings with idea notes but you want to remember the spark so you know there are definitely a few ways to do that you can like just use timestamps which is well that's that's the beauty actually can i dive in i think so so let me let me just make sure my file explorer is good file window i should say so if i go into the light kit and oh i need to open it open vault here's what you can do you can open a new folder within the same vault actually so like it and stamps so i don't have anything other than a template note but if you wanted to do this you can create your work notes your time stamped notes and completely separate vault in obsidian let's say but you won't get any clutter for your ideas this is a subfolder it exists right here i just have drilled in that's one solution i mean or you could just do a completely separate folder however if you think you're going to be linking ideas i don't like that approach because then it just it creates a lot of friction and mental kind of unease with where stuff lives so maybe you want to try to dial in like just drill in to open a new vault this way there are probably some other solutions but we can you know look at that a little bit later thank you aaron nick was able to accelerate his career by developing and working with maps um i think i'm thinking of changing careers and would like to know how maps can help with this purpose okay this one's really important and you know your mileage may vary but when you create a map of content you are future proofing your your skill set in many ways your ability to talk about a domain of knowledge and so you know if i create a map of content that feels pretty good about habits and if i do another one about personal development and another one about mental models you know this is sort of giving me this overlapping venn diagram of different domains that relate in interesting ways and let's say you know i was working at as a i don't know a teacher somewhere in high school and they have layoffs they're going remote for whatever reason no long my job is gone if i've been building up these maps this might give me an opportunity to enter into a different profession a different industry so this is optionality i hate using the quote brackets like that but just whenever i use a word i'll throw those up optionality to to bounce into different careers and whatnot um just from what i'm trying to get at is it's just from you exercising your joy in interests and hobbies and developing developing your sense of these these domains just through that activity you've created value for yourself so when the next pandemic hits you you can quickly pivot potentially pivot into a new area um because you never know like the world is a fast fast changing place but if you've not just churned and burned ideas throughout throughout your time but if you've captured them and you've grown them then they become your assets they're like your bank account and when times are tough you go to that bank account and you start being like okay how can i apply this information to the current landscape of the world when it comes to my career i hope that helps what i'm not saying is if you do this then you know any job is yours and in any industry certainly not i'm just saying it it helps you be creative with your options in the future that said um when i when i bounced um when i moved to los angeles four and a half years ago uh my girlfriend had a teaching my very long-term girlfriend had a teaching job um at ucla and i used that i decided to move with her and and i still have a fitness boxing business and whatnot but this allowed me finally access to the true industry so when you work in the entertainment industry you kind of have to be in los angeles if you want to make you know the connections and do things the right way um and so i applied the concepts that i've been growing and i made a few special maps of content around how can i make it in in this industry and you know that was initially it was about like understanding the industry itself like the etiquette you know the expectations the hidden code of that industry and then i could reference notes to that and then i had another one that was tracking um people and their interests and different things a version of that we will be using in the workshop which i'm really excited about it will be like privacy protected so don't worry about that but for the people who are in it we're going to see how we can how we're related to each other in our passions and ideas and we'll use the obsidian framework actually for that so we'll have a real live class example of of that and i think it'll kind of help us work with each other and get to know each other i could keep going here but i'm just going to to move on to the next one i'd like to follow up on greg's question i'm curious to learn more hear more about the place for top-down input you're working on this big article yeah so this is definitely a top-down issue because you know what you're talking about but it can also be bottom-up depending on from where you're starting so i approach my writing with a clear sense of some things that i know i want to discuss in the article how to best think about relating this oh it's joel hey joel and i didn't see that until just now um i'm working on article third generation uh of course yeah so i approach my writing with a clear sense of some things i want how to best think about relating this sense of a top-down sense of purpose well i i'm not familiar enough to know i would call i'm not enough familiar enough to riff on this quickly but you know and you don't have to append mlc here i just it's a little bit easy for me to find it as i look but then you know you could let me copy and paste this again give that a title and then i might just quickly outline uh i won't call it heading but um topic one moc and then you know i'd have link something like this and they just come right because you probably have these notes you're not starting from scratch i know that so then you can just start putting them in place and then you know let's say link 20 is also you know that's the nice thing about a map of content you can have a link in different places and so i think it'd be about considering how you can you know this would be the top-down approach where you're starting with your topic you're starting with the title and then you drill down to topics i mean think like five paragraph essay perhaps you know just different um templates that you skeletons that you can use outlines which which one is going to work best for your you know research for this project and uh something important is making sure if you're working with others that you you kind of figure out what topics that how they see things too so you can kind of decide what these topics can be and how they can look i hope that's somewhat of a helpful beginning okay i know this is a quick demo and you weren't focused on creating a real chunky note if you were how would you indicate that the wikipedia entry is not your writing yeah i totally would indicate that by the way so thanks for bringing it up scott let's go back to chunking yeah i was working way too fast so my apologies there but yeah i would just quote it and i might just do that or i might even go just a step further and just do wiki because in theory i'd have all my thoughts right here as i was going and then this just gives me a little bit of a reference um yeah i would do something like that and i would try to keep it about this short and i would and i would probably like rewrite this or make sure that they're the best quotes that i think are are the most important so that very good point though that when in doubt add those those quotations oh and you're also right too what you mentioned is you can just as easily do this i just find that sometimes then i have to you know it's just a markdown thing where you might have to do it for a couple other notes but it certainly looks nice that way so especially when you you're writing in line so i actually would say that what you showed there is a pretty good approach so both quotes and um the quote syntax would be the ideal option only if i want the quote to stand out though i'll put that little caveat on it because you know i think that kind of gets to where where i want to focus a lot is not just to heavily link everything where it's unreadable but figure out ways we're telling stories so each note should really direct the the viewer's eye to where you want the the eye to go and when i say viewer i mean your future self and any outside audience so it's like do i want for for my theme do i want wiki to stand out this much well i obviously i don't but so i'm fine with just the quotes so that's another little aesthetic consideration it seems like folders and mlcs can both serve as workbenches places to temporary gather notes what are the disadvantages and advantages of using one or the other so we have the option now you're right joel i find that the mlc is usually the way to go just because it's faster it's so much faster to be able to hit you know your bracket button and then start compiling notes this way um however if you really our minds still do work in in hierarchy and the folders still have value so there is a place where you might just want to keep things in a specific folder um you know habits example and to make this point clear i would put you know incubation what i'm trying to tell myself is this is temporary and you know i'm just using it for now oh sorry scrolling too quickly and i can put all this stuff in here but once i feel something is good what i would do is like uh like begets like let's check this out hey this is pretty good i'm happy with this so it was in this folder i'm just going to click and drag and plop it into the main section so you can kind of use it as an incubation chamber okay i feel a bit about this note and i can throw it out because it's i mean look it's su it's well connected it's very well connected i'm happy with it um so you know there's some options i try to avoid the folders because i find that after a while that i'm hunting for where it is i'm like is it in the habits example yet or is it and then i'm back to where i don't want to be which is like hunting and twirling down folders so you know that's that's the thing to be careful about [Music] [Music] you
