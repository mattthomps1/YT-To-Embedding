[Music] um everywhere you look nowadays someone 
is losing a job maybe it be your family   your friends maybe even you it seems like the 
world is really upside down right now when it   comes to money and careers and security and it 
really gets you thinking what jobs are secure   for the future are you in a job that you 
can have and grow in in the next five ten   years or are you in a job that AI is going 
to take over and really as of recent AI has   been a huge topic of conversation especially 
because of chat GPT put a sports car on the   nearest table then rotated by 90 degrees and 
make it move back and forth along the surface [Music] place a tree frog on the nearest plane [Music]   was super cool okay put a 
rocket ship on the nearest table [Music] cool make it twice as big and make it lift off [Music]   it's definitely trending and you can see 
already even with implementation of chat   GPT how many jobs would be swept out because 
of this platform such as writers bloggers   Etc it takes over so many jobs because it can do 
the thinking for you this brings you back to the   question of well where do I find a job what job 
can I get into that I will be secure and that   will still be in demand in the future today we are 
going to be covering the top 15 jobs that will be   in demand not only today but in the future also 
we're going to put a little spin on this video   and also cover the jobs that will be automated 
in the future I really wanted to do both because   I feel like there's a lot of videos out there 
that talk about the positives and make sure you   get this job to grow for the future and this job 
but what if you are in a job that won't be there   in the future and although these are tough 
conversations to have it's important to have   them so we can properly prepare for them before we 
get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe   button for more Tech encoding related content and 
let's just Jump Right In to it let's just get in   let's start with the positives and then lead with 
the robots taking over all of our jobs [Music]   with the world going more and more digital 
everything's digital nowadays it's great   because our homes are automated we have so many 
iot devices you know you can from your thermostat   being able to detect what temperature it is 
and adjust accordingly to your coffee machine   going on every morning at 8am your whole life can 
essentially be automated but the problem with this   is there becomes a lot more vulnerabilities that 
hackers can utilize to learn more about you to   spy on you to watch you so it's no surprise here 
that the number one job that will be continue to   be in demand is cyber security engineer or 
cyber security expert now I really want to   reframe that rather than cyber security engineer 
but cyber security expert because there could   be many different roles within this category 
that are very in demand but cyber security is   something that will continue to grow and grow 
as Tech continues to expand and unfortunately   security risks continue to as well cyber Security 
Experts are expected to have advanced knowledge   in areas such as cryptography network security 
protocols firewalls and threat detection systems   so there's a lot to learn there the good news is 
you don't need to go back to school for another   four years to get a degree in order to get into 
cyber security there are tons of free courses and   resources online that you can start using start 
networking and building a career Within cybers   security okay let's get some green screen going 
you know let's get some more visuals going next   on the list is social media manager and this 
is so funny because I feel like a few years ago   this role would have honestly been scuffed at 
or laughed at like that's not a real job what   kind of job is that but let's face it social 
media is here and it's not going anywhere these   large influencers who are working with many 
different companies many different brands they   need someone often to manage their campaigns and 
this is where social media manager comes in as a   social media manager you might manage many many 
different influencers not just necessarily one   this is a great rule too because it can be done 
well actually all these roles can be done from   virtually anywhere you can work right from home 
right from your computer or wherever you want next   on the list this is such a fun one that really 
merges fashion with technology which is virtual   reality designer yes you've heard that correctly 
as more people and more companies are exploring   getting into the metaverse or what that really 
means what that looks like virtual reality the   need to have designers in this space is really 
important now what's the difference between a   regular designer regular designer who thought 
we'd be in a world where we're saying regular   designer versus digital designer but here we are 
the regular or physical designer I guess you could   call it they are actually taking into account 
fitting for people's bodies different body types   whereas you are designed digitally there's less 
worry about that as technology can handle that   part and more so about what environment people are 
going to be playing in so what kind of world these   characters are living in it's a whole different 
realm of considerations but it's a really fun   and challenging job that we will continue 
to see more and more as our lives continue   to be more integrated into this world next on 
the list is data scientist and once again I'm   sure this is not a shocker but data science is 
not only something that's in demand now but as   companies continue to gather more and more data 
we need someone to analyze that data be able to   communicate what it means and how to utilize 
it in the best way possible so not only data   scientists data analysts anything around data 
you are definitely going to be safe within in   the next coming years next on the list is game 
developer and I'm sure you're waiting for this   one as video games not only are currently so in 
demand but just similar to the other rules I've   spoken about they're not going anywhere we are 
continuing to play more video games to spend   more time in that world that area and the need 
for game developers is continuing to grow now   one thing with game developers is I'm not sure the 
exact stats around it but I do believe that there   is a huge shortage for game developers out there 
as products continue to become more intense and   more detailed game development is great area to 
specialize in and this is one of these jobs that   if you're already a developer it's more easy to 
transition into game development you do not need   to go back to school and get formal education for 
it you can take a boot camp learn online learn on   YouTube there are so many different ways next on 
the list is user experience designer ux designer   UI designer both of those I know they're different 
things but both of those are going to continue to   be so intimate that reason being is because every 
business nowadays is going digital and they need   an expert to help with the user experience if you 
have a bad user experience but a great product   very unlikely that customers will even come 
to you still they'll find something else that   might be maybe even less great of a product but 
has a better user experience so you can see how   important user experience designers really are now 
we have this whole user experience design setup we   need someone to actually implement it and that's 
where full stack developers come in full stack   developers will continue to be so in demand in the 
future because well first of all let me step back   I'm sure there's people yelling at their screen 
right now being like AI is going to take over   developers jobs why are you including it no no no 
let's take a step back and be realistic here AI   is not going to take over software Engineers jobs 
or developers jobs what it will do is will enable   us to be able to work on more complex issues and 
that's really why it's so important now more than   ever to be a continuous or forever learner what 
you know today the skills you possess us today   will be obsolete tomorrow relatively speaking but 
you need to continue to level up and upskill now   I'm not saying to spend every week every waking 
moment learning something new but rather be aware   of what's trending be aware of what's growing 
and what's out there and if you find something of   interest to you stick with it and continue to grow 
your learnings in that direction for example a lot   of people right now are continuing to learn about 
blockchain and web3 actually speaking of that that   is next on our list blockchain developers are 
continuing to become more and more in demand I'm   sure you've seen articles where they're making 
half a million plus doing their jobs like it's   crazy how in demand they are right now and they 
will continue to be although you know we hear   Horror Stories of the crypto market and what's 
going on in that world the technology the actual   blockchain technology is not going anywhere and 
I'm not saying anything else is either but I'm   saying we have to remember to really separate the 
two that blockchain technology can be used for so   much more than just currencies and the companies 
and the increasing number of companies that are   continuing to implement blockchain Technologies 
is huge from Healthcare to sports teams to every   industry is starting to touch and blockchain 
developers they're responsible for Designing   creating implementing distributed Ledger systems 
that facilitate transactions between two parties   without the need for the third party so similar 
to how cryptocurrency works but you can think of   it used for so many other things it's of course 
important to have a deep understanding as how   this technology works and one of the great things 
about being a blockchain developer is if you are   already an engineer or developer it's pretty 
simple to get into that area of specialization   if it's something of interest to you there are 
so many great resources online I mean there is   for everything I'm listing here that you literally 
just I think more than anything you need to find   something you're passionate about next on the 
list is robotics engineer as robots continue to   become more and more popular this role continues 
to grow as well and it's such an interesting role   it's something that you know if I was to do it all 
over again I think robotics engineering would be   such an interesting thing to explore and to become 
a robotics engineer you have to have an in-depth   understanding of engineering principles and be 
able to apply that knowledge to the development of   robotic systems so this could include designing 
the robot's components testing the system for   functionality programming it and so much more 
I really like it because it's an interesting   mix between the software you have to have software 
knowledge but also Hardware knowledge as well next   on the list is virtual reality developer and this 
is an area that once again if you are already in   the tech industry and just want to specialize it's 
a great area to consider they are high in demand   due into the increasing number of businesses that 
are looking to leverage technology for different   applications they must have in-depth knowledge 
and understanding of computer graphics 3D modeling   game design and development programming languages 
you need to know something such as C plus Java and   or Python and they are essentially responsible for 
as it sounds like creating immersive applications   for virtual reality this is a very fun and 
interesting job but I also think it's very   challenging as well which makes it one of my top 
ones so what are some jobs that AI will probably   take over the first one is receptionist and 
I'm sure you've seen a lot of this already   whether you are going to appointment or checking 
in somewhere seeing that a lot of times now there   is no human to contact and similarly this goes for 
cashiers oftentimes now when I go to a drugstore   or Shoppers I'm not sure if you have Shoppers 
where you're listening to this but any kind of   store where you run errands now there everything 
is automated a lot of times there might just be   one person working and monitoring but what used 
to be 10 people we've seen this for years now   it's continuing to go further in that direction 
the next on the list that's maybe not there quite   yet but we'll be very quickly is self-driving cars 
yes we know that cars can self-drive already in   areas they are permitted in other areas they 
are not but as it continues this technology   continues to get better and better things 
like truck drivers taxi drivers Uber drivers   we'll continue to diminish at a very quick rate 
and what about Courier Services when you think   about getting a package delivered right now a lot 
of times yes it's done by a person but imagine if   it was drones that are delivering all our packages 
or having this kind of grid system in the sky that   they are in charge of or deliver I know I sound 
like I'm getting a little crazy a little out there   but if you would have explained to someone five 
years ago even what our world looks like today   they would have thought the same thing and this 
is a really interesting and fun topic to start   thinking about I would say fun but I know for some 
people it can be very scary because maybe you are   in one of those roles and that really brings me 
to sum this up which is at the end of the day   the most important thing is to continue to level 
up continue to upskill gain new skills gain new   skill sets and the best way to do that is right 
at your fingertips with the internet there are   so many different courses so many different 
programs that it's not necessarily resources   that are lacking but rather what is lacking is 
you need to find your passion and the best way   to do that is spend a few few different days or a 
few different hours of a day really understanding   where you get passionate what excites you you 
know maybe watch a video on blockchain maybe   watch a video on data science see what that 
spark is for you and explore it just because   you commit to one thing today doesn't mean 
you need to do it in 20 years from now and   that's the beauty of the world we live in is I 
think our roles and our jobs will constantly be   changing as our interests do too because now we 
have the technology to support us continuing to   evolve in that way I hope you enjoy this video 
not only understanding what jobs are going to   continue to be in demand but also understanding 
that yes there are jobs that will be taken away   from us but how can we navigate that in the 
best way possible if you haven't already   make sure to hit that subscribe button it really 
supports me and also leave in the comments other   questions you have that you want me to answer 
I answer every single question you leave in   the comments so leave them down below and I'll
