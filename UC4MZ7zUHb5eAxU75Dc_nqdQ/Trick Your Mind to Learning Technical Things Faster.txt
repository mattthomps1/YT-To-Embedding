when I first broke into tech one of the things 
I noticed right away was just how much there   was to learn I thought to myself there is no 
way I'm ever going to be able to know this all   how am I ever going to pick up all the skills 
required or get ahead when it seems impossible   for everything there is to know fast forward 
now to five years in the industry one thing   that hasn't changed is there is still so much 
to learn and rather than coming at it from a   point of how am I ever going to learn all this 
and feeling overwhelmed and just freezing up   because there's so much to learn I started 
looking at it from a different point of view   point of view where it's rather than feeling this 
way how can I develop skills to learn quicker how   can I learn and pick up different technical 
things quicker and this has been through so   much trial and error and everyone's so different 
but I really want to share with you different ways   that have helped me and ensure that I'm learning 
things as quick as possible but also is efficient   because it goes back to the saying you don't want 
quality over quantity no you don't want quantity   or quality let's clarify that you want quality 
you don't want quantity yes okay anyways I'm   going to share with you some of my tips that 
really have helped me some that are kind of   surprising and I think maybe you wouldn't have 
thought of so let's get right into it foreign space here and let's just get right into it when 
I was first learning how to learn because I think   learning how to learn is a skill in itself one 
of the things that really helped me was I found   myself starting to speak out loud to no one or 
sometimes to Paul my boyfriend but mainly it was   just to myself and the purpose of that was when I 
started teaching or speaking out loud about what   I was learning I actually learned where there 
were holes in my knowledge Gap or where there   were gaps in my knowledge I saw okay I'm able 
to speak about this very well but I can't really   talk about this part of it I need to go back and 
revisit that and that's something that I still do   today all the time when I'm teaching or going to 
be learning a new technical topic is taking a step   back and speaking out loud you know you're going 
to look like a crazy person especially if you're   just talking to yourself but to really understand 
as far as where there were gaps in my knowledge   also speaking about learning new technical things 
or new technologies coming up I wanted to say a   big thank you to orox for sponsoring this video 
the oryx wallet is really designed with its users   in mind so it allows for better storage tighter 
security smarter insights all at your fingertips   also there is no sign up or download 
required in order to join the waitlist   I linked it down below so make sure 
to sign up today so you don't miss out   also it's really important if you are interested 
in this to sign up now because it's very exclusive   and it's only actually accepting a limited number 
of users to begin with so okay let me explain   a little bit of how it works the wallet really 
rewards its users so it's similar to the way Amex   does for credit card folders wallet users will get 
access to exclusive membership rewards and another   thing they get access to is the orok society so 
this includes getting invited to private parties   and events hosted during conferences in addition 
to access to private Discord where orox provides   tips and information about the crypto Market in 
general something else I thought was really cool   is you actually get rewarded for performing the 
same tasks that you would do on other wallets   such as sending receiving end swapping crypto 
how it works is you will receive points that   will be redeemable for nfts free swaps and more 
so it's really more than a wallet you're joining   this really exclusive community and with that 
exclusivity comes exclusive nft drops that if   you are user you will have Early Access to okay 
let's talk a little bit about gasless swapping   the oryx wallet circumvents a traditional 
approach to swapping and does not require   ethereum in order to pay for Network fees when 
executing transactions also I don't know about   you but having a clean UI and intuitive design 
is so important in these wallets and one thing I   found with the oryx wallet is it provides an easy 
experience to view my Investment Portfolio at a   glance so for example there is no need to change 
networks in order to see all of my investments I   can see how my portfolio is performing whether the 
coin is ethereum or otherwise one thing I really   like about orox2 is the way they do security so 
of course security that includes recovering your   security phase or protection against phishing but 
they also do some really interesting things too so   one of the ways that they really do with security 
is the user doesn't actually have to memorize the   12 key passphrase they're just able to download 
the extension on let's say a new computer or a   new phone and log in with a username and password 
and it will recover the those 12 key passphrases   to their computer automatically I linked orox down 
below so make sure to go sign up today and this is   such an easy thing that can be done even if you 
don't have someone to you know share what you're   learning with you can just do it to yourself or 
as the more famous version of it is called the   rubber ducky method where people will speak to 
a rubber ducky to really get across where their   knowledge is at and what they know another thing I 
really like to do when I'm just learning something   is start writing so I will actually start I'll 
never share it at that stage because I'm still   learning it but I'll start doing say writing a 
script for a video or writing a blog post and   once again you don't have to share this but when 
you start getting your thoughts out on paper or on   the you know computer it really shows okay this 
is what I know about this is what I know about   that this is where I need to learn and it's 
another really great way to highlight where   what you still need to learn and I think that 
is a really great way to learn faster as well   is speaking about it or writing it down what 
you have learned so far and uh it's one of   those things that maybe sometimes I'll start 
a blog post and won't finish it for a while as   I'm learning the thing but then as I continue 
to grow my skills in that technical area I can   continue to rework the blog post and then 
share it another thing I do that or that I   think I'm guilty of and I really try not to do 
is cramming cramming is something that is so   easy to do where you have one day and you know 
you can spend hours working on this thing or   so much time and you're gonna you know achieve so 
much throughout the day with it but then in turn   you get burnt out often and then the other thing 
is you don't oh this chair's a little squeaky   so you get burnt out very quickly and then the 
other thing is you end up kind of resenting what   you are learning so then you don't look forward 
to learning you don't look forward to the next   steps with it so I really suggest that you do 
not cram cramming is something that as humans   we want to do just like shove all our learnings 
in one day but even if you have the full day   available really set your limits for me I would 
say on average I do about I'm learning something   new maybe it's like 45 minutes 45 to one hour 
sitting down and focusing in on something and   then even if I'm going to learn more throughout 
the day I'll take a step back go for a walk get   a breather and just give my mind a break because 
you're learning especially when it's technical   things it's very it can be very draining it's a 
lot especially when it's a new technical topic   so don't put this pressure on yourself to study 
or to you know cram in something for 8 10 hours   a day and speaking of putting pressure on yourself 
or not putting pressure on yourself I think it's   really important to be realistic with with your 
learnings and how quickly you will learn don't   have these expectations that you are going to 
become an expert on something in two days or three   days have expectations that if I learn x amount 
every day over time I will naturally become really   good at that and I know that's counter-intuitive 
okay if you're talking about learning things   really quickly but if I'm not spending all this 
time and moving really quickly on it that seems   like it's going to be slower but no because 
the key here it's very important to note is   it might be sore to get going you might start 
slower but in turn what will happen is you will   have better quality knowledge of the topic and 
you will not have to go back later and relearn   it which in turn takes way longer and I get 
asked a lot about tutorials especially when   it comes to technical things and I am so guilty 
when I was starting out and even to this day it's   still easy to do where you get stuck in tutorial 
how where you take one tutorial and you're still   uncertain of your skill level or knowledge so 
you take another and then you take another but   you never get those training wheels off the bike 
because you keep on taking tutorial after tutorial   thinking one day you'll get it or one day you'll 
get better but you can't solely rely on tutorials   tutorials are great they are essential I think 
what I usually do is read the documentation then   go take a tutorial but I'm not going to pick up 
one of these courses where it's 50 hours plus long   I think if you're completely new in learning 
a new programming language or learning a new   stack then that might be necessary but if you are 
just learning a new technical topic try and keep   the chorus to a minimum we don't need to spend 
50 hours in one course on there rather I would   suggest breaking it up so maybe take a course that 
is two hours or three hours long and then go back   to writing about it or taking notes like physical 
notes the physical notes I don't know what the   data is around it but there's so much information 
and studies that have been done around how taking   actual notes with pen and paper I'm talking will 
really help you reinforce your learnings and   remember what you are learning better and when I 
was doing research on this and just getting really   obsessed with this topic I came across this video 
it's called 10 my tricks to learn anything fast   and I was like what are they recommending what 
are they suggesting and one of the things that   they recommend is called a study sleep study 
sandwich and I'll link the video down below   because it's a great video as well that has some 
really interesting ideas and what it is really is   scientists who have put their focus and study onto 
the best ways to learn new things quickly have the   number one thing they have figured out or done 
research on is the study sleep study method which   is study for a short period of time and sleep 
or take a break then come back to studying and   what it does is it actually allows your brain 
your mind to have time to digest what you have   learned versus if you are just studying for long 
periods of time you're not allowing your brain to   really digest what it just took in what it just 
learned and in turn you're not going to retain   that information for a long time next which is 
important to note is everyone learns different and   studies differently and learns quickly differently 
and I came across this really interesting survey   it's called sq3r and I'll link it down below as 
well and they really Share three different methods   to studying three different kind of patterns that 
you can use so I'll put it up on screen here one   being sq3r method pq4r method and thieves method 
and as you can see on screen there's different   ways that you really can learn different kind of 
patterns and I think it's a great thing to follow   and and I'll link down to they have a survey for 
which works best for you and take that survey I'm   going to take it as well actually and to see kind 
of what ways your mind will learn best and I think   it's important to play around with this but I 
really like the research and study done behind it   okay another thing that I do and I didn't even 
realize that this had a technical or actual name   to it but it is called retrieval practice and what 
it is is remembering at a later time so oftentimes   what I have found that I like to do is when I'm 
learning something new I will go on Quizlet or any   of these sites where you can make different kind 
of cue cards or flash cards and I have the app on   my phone so I will actually kind of make different 
questions and answers for myself that I can come   back to at a later time and this has been a really 
great and effective way for me to learn new things   because what it will do is I'm writing down taking 
notes as I am learning and then if I'm on say the   train or the subway and want to you know get in 
15 or 10 minutes of refreshing my memory I will   go back to these cue cards on my phone and just 
kind of quiz myself and it's a great way retrieval   learning to really focus on what you learned a 
few days ago and keep on reiterating over and over   that because sometimes our minds need to hear this 
information more than once well most of the time   they do and this is a great way to do that so I'll 
link Quizlet down below as well it's a completely   free or I use a free version anyways of it to quiz 
yourself and on the go when you have a few minutes   it takes four or five minutes all you really need 
and it just keeps on getting your mind thinking   about the topic thinking about the subject 
that you are learning on a more frequent basis   okay those are my main tips I would say for 
tricking your mind to learn anything faster and it   really is an art that and everyone's so different 
but I really think those are some tricks that no   matter what uh kind of learner you are will really 
help Quicken or speed up your learning time and   it's different ways that will help your mind get 
better at learning it's honestly an art in itself   which I think is not enough people to speak about 
is the science behind it the data behind it so I   really wanted to include some different scientific 
ways as well from the study sleep study method to   the survey that I link down below to really tell 
what kind of path of learning you should focus on   I mean nothing's 100 accurate but I just think 
it's looking at it from more of a scientific   and data-driven standpoint is always the way 
to go if you haven't already make sure to hit   that subscribe button for more Tech coding career
