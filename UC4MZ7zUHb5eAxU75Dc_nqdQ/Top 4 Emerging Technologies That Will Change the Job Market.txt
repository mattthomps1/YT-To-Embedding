hello coming to you from the future there's no doubt about it the world is changing and probably changing at a quicker Pace than it ever has mainly because of Technology advances as technology continues to advance at a quicker rate things are changing so fast that as humans it's hard to keep up with it especially we have seen as people who are technologists work in the tech industry well really all Industries I think though people who are tech savvy or work in the tech industry are more aware of what the repercussions or what might happen in the near future because of Technology changing at such a quick Pace in this video I'm going to be sharing with you the top technologies that will really change the future of work forever not only sharing with you what these Technologies are how they are implemented but also too ways that you can stay ahead of the curve because let's face it we're all I think most of us in technology are Learners forever Learners wanting to evolve and grow and are super passionate and curious about tech so let's just make sure where we are learning is on the right path all right let's jump into it why do we say jump into it what are we what are we jumping into foreign first on the list is quantum Computing Quantum Computing is something that I literally had to search up and be like explain it to me like I am a child and I still need it to be explained to me that way because it is so fascinating so complicated or complex so quickly but let me do let me do a lit I need my computer for this to explain Quantum Computing in simple terms is a new kind of computing that uses the principles of quantum metrics to process information so unlike classical computers which uses bits to represent information such as zero or one I think we all are familiar with that at least quantum computers use qubits qubits I think that's what it's called quibits can represent both one and zero at the same time so essentially if I'm putting this away essentially from my understanding is quantum with Quantum Computing it can solve multiple problems at once so it's really smart at not it's it's really quick let's put it this way one area that Quantum Computing will really create a lot of new jobs that we're already seeing is with cryptography currently many encryption systems rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their Prime components with a quantum computer though running Shores algorithm could potentially solve this problem much faster so how will Quantum Computing potentially affect your job what how does it like who care is quantum Computing great Quantum Computing not only will create a ton of new jobs such as the cryptographers that already exists but are continuing to grow but also too it will be ingrained further into our everyday lives especially with say software engineers if you think about software engineers and how Quantum Computing might take a play into it think about the way software Engineers may need to develop new programming languages algorithms to optimize a performance of quantum computers companies are going to want to get their hands on Quantum Computing as fast as possible the idea that quantum computers can solve more than one problem at once be double or triple as efficient as they currently are normal computers currently are is a major bonus now not only will Quantum Computing affect existing jobs it will create so many new ones I just mentioned and I think the key thing is here you need to understand throughout this video we're listing a few different technologies that will really have an impact on jobs and I want one thing that you take away from these to be you don't need to learn everything but this is rather to inform you educate you and inspire you that maybe one of these Technologies is something you're interested in for example with Quantum Computing it's something that you're going to have to be very comfortable with math you're going to have to enjoy math really want to dive into that side of things now I've been following this company called Humane for a while now and for those of you who aren't familiar with it it's dubbed or labeled as a secretive AI company founded by ex Apple employees they recently raised another 100 million dollars and thought what are they building over there their website if you go on it it's very secret they don't really talk about what they're creating or building and it's really been hush-hushed up until recently recently there was a leaked clip of what they are working on and this is done by or this is shared by one of the founders and I'll share with you I don't know if I'm allowed to share with you on about it on YouTube the actual Clips probably not so rather I'll share some articles on what it was but essentially what it is is it's both hardware and software where one of the founders is wearing this piece of Hardware that emits onto his hand or to a wall whatever the the subject is it looks kind of like a phone and in this example where he was sharing what they've been working on he was using it as as exactly that a phone where his wife is calling him he puts up his phone and he can answer it just by tapping on his hand now this is super interesting maybe it will work maybe it won't work but they've been raising a lot of money for quite a while on this and they're they're all in on it why I'm sharing this story with you is because more and more I am hearing stories like this of different companies really pushing the boundaries with augmented reality augmented reality we've seen is really just at the cusp of what is possible with it and how we can integrate it into our daily lives when you think about education imagine a classroom where students are immersed and they can actually go back in time not literally but figuratively in the sense that they can interact with Dinosaurs or they can put on a headset and interact with whatever the use case is it's a really great way for Education Health Care music industry all of these things and I really think it's an area based on what we've seen trends of companies working on that will continue to affect our daily jobs so you're probably saying tip how is this going to affect my job well of course it varies based on what job you are in but as we've seen for example with the iPhone IOS app development when there's a new technology that really blows up and hits everyone everyone starts using it the tech behind it that was used to build that build that really blows up as well and I think AR is an area that if you're interested in that technology it's definitely worth exploring on a larger scale as to how you can utilize it and build with it it's one of those things that you learn early on and then when the demand hits you already have that skill set and are so valuable to companies next on the list is something that looks really cute I guess you could say but definitely can be ferocious this is Advanced robotics now what do I mean by it can look really cute I'm sure we've all seen this dog by Boston Dynamics where they share with you this dog that is essentially a robot and every time I see it I want to take it home even though it's a robot actually recently the NYPD started using these robots from Boston Dynamics to help them in situations where there is a bomb detected or there is a life-threatening risk that they do not want to actually send a human in to investigate so this is super interesting ways that Robotics are being used in our everyday lives and we will continue to see them being merged closer together I mean even if you look at restaurants in Japan I'll find some clips here to share with you I was seeing online recently there's this restaurant where you literally are served and you give your order through a robot there's no need for human intervention now I'm not saying this to scare you in the sense of robots are going to take over all of our jobs but rather the opposite there is going to be so much opportunity with working with robots that are is coming your way now you might be saying Tiff I am a software engineer robots don't really impact me it might not be the actual Hardware robotics that affect you might be more the software the AI side of things that affects you and it's similar though in the sense that we are learning to work or work alongside these tools versus being scared of them or think of them out to get our jobs we need to embrace them we are in control we know more than they do well typically not always and it's one of those things that they're going to enhance our workflow help us really work quicker safer in some instances like the NYPD and in turn build faster freeing up our minds to really focus on new and Innovative things that we might have not even thought about I know for myself I use chat gbt a lot and I use it to help me writing blog posts writing emails pretty much all of my writing tasks I honestly rely a lot on chat GPT now I modified the response from chat GPT into my own of course but what it does is if there's something I'm putting off like an email using chat GPT to just prompt that and start that conversation really helps me stop procrastinating and just getting it done knowing it'll be so much quicker with the help of that tool this frees up my time to do other things that I might have been so far on procrastinating that email I spent all day hopefully not all day but a long period of time working on it now it is important to note though with robotics Nai really becoming more advanced it's so important I mean that's the whole purpose of this video is to focus on upskilling and continuing to learn I was reading though recently there's an interesting thing that is starting to occur where there will be this new job or new jobs that are going to be popping up which is around the ethics of AI and Robotics it's a really unique and in my opinion be a very tricky job who decides what ethics who decides what's right and what's wrong it's almost this this interesting job but it's coming up in a lot of cases so as advanced robotics become more integrated into our daily lives there will be a growing need for professionals who can address the ethical legal and regulate the implications of these Technologies this sounds like a pretty interesting job and it's definitely something that if you have the technical side technical knowledge you can merge with really strong soft skills last but definitely not least on the list can you get what would you guess it is it's iot in fact the iot market is predicted to have such rapid growth listen to this stat the number of connected devices that is predicted to reach over 75 billion by 2025. that's in two years from now a year and a half really from now with this expansion it presents a ton of career growth opportunities in the realm of iot one of these career opportunities that you have seen in many different areas but specifically in iot the need for is cyber security I think we've all heard to some varying degree stories about someone's camera a story of a camera that got hacked and images were being taken or watched It's really creepy but it's really real it's there it's out there this is happening and the need for cyber Security Experts to help prevent these hackings is becoming increasingly more important now in some other videos I've made talking about cyber security I've gone in comments around cyber security is going to become automated curious to hear your thoughts on this leave down in the comments I truly do not believe it this is a job that can become automated at least in the near future it needs that human decision-making factor and that's not going to go away anywhere we cannot let machines decide what is safe and secure for us we need to do that as humans the roles are continuing to be unfilled right now for cyber security needs we see these In Articles consistently and if you are someone who's interested in cyber security honestly I think this is one of the best areas that you can really break into at this time iot is an area too where your existing product service or application a company that you work for might get into it becomes more common for devices to be equipped with iot it's only a matter of time before you are introduced in a situation where your company or future company has a product that uses iot there are so many different courses you can take a lot of fun things you can build or Tinker around with with iot I'll list some of them here but it's a great opportunity for you to really upskill and learn something new if I had a bit more time on my hands I think this is an area I'd really dive into because the possibilities of what you can build with it are kind of endless all right we have listed some technologies that are continuing to grow in demand and will affect our jobs as people who work in the tech industry which you know I sometimes think it's strange to say as we work in the tech industry what does that even really mean at the end of the day Tech touches all Industries and that's the beauty of it our growth our careers and that can be in many Industries but Tech as a whole will be impacted by these Technologies which in my opinion is really exciting and something that we should embrace rather than being fearful of if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more button for more attack coding career related content leave down below in the comments any questions you have feedback thoughts you have around this I do my absolute best to answer every single one of your questions and thoughts and all right let's go into the future to get it [Music] thank you foreign
