well grandpa I really want to know what technologies I should learn in 2023 like what would be what did you learn back in your day well Young Buck let me tell you about what I wouldn't do again these Technologies spend hours learning only to become obsolete I feel like we're starting off with one that is going to cause an uproar or some controversy not because this is incorrect what I'm saying but because some people have such a strong attachment or love for things or more specifically for finding the yeah but in things and especially as a YouTuber I I know this better than I think a lot of people when you make videos and they go yeah but what about this one percent can you guess what the first one is that honestly I definitely will not be learning in 2023 if ever well definitely not I'm never going to be learning this can you guess it's a programming language it starts with a C has a B in the middle and now at the end give me two o's in the middle Cobalt this is definitely not worth learning in 2023 now let me explain here are some fun facts actually about the Cobalt programming language it was actually developed in 1959 making it almost 60 years no over 60 years old which is pretty wild it definitely had its time and place where large systems were using Cobalt it was very popular and in demand nowadays more popular and modern programming languages such as python JavaScript Java have really replaced Cobalt and actually according to stack overflow's report from 2021 I believe it was it was only 0.0.3 percent of programmers code with Cobalt so it brings up the question which many have asked if if this is not that In Demand anymore and people aren't learning about it as much the people who do have these not this knowledge to maintain these systems because there is still systems out there that are using it they must get paid pretty amazing and of course this depends company to company I can definitely see if there are programmers who have been working in Cobalt for many years at the same company they probably are banking a really large salary the average when I searched up online salary for a Cobalt programmer is between 60 000 and 100 000 U.S now I I think there's a lot of factors and variables that this isn't telling us here like how long these programmers have been at these companies what does that really look like like are they just using Cobalt or do they just use some knowledge to that and work with some more modern ones really interesting so back in the day back in my day I should say five different glasses I don't know that's how grandpas do maybe not okay and I'll go over here no I'm just kidding not that was not my day I was not born yet but back in the day why was Cobalt so popular just out of curiosity what made it so popular it was specifically designed to cater to business applications and data processing tasks on mainframe computers so it was used extensively for many different purposes some including Financial Services government systems you see that's a huge area where it was used a lot in payroll and HR inventory management Etc and it's really interesting because a lot of high profile organizations actually still rely on cobalt-based systems for critical operation so it's definitely not extinct by any means but it is definitely not something that I would spend time learning on in 2023. next on the list is I need a camera here can you guess what it is Flash programming have you even heard of flash programming there are some people who haven't even heard of flash programming I've just heard Rumblings about it but here's really why it was used flash programming was used to create interactive multimedia content such as animations it rich internet application occasions for websites and it was developed actually by a company called macro media and later in life acquired by Adobe Flash became popular really in the 90s and early 2000s due to its ability to deliver high graphics high quality Graphics at the time and video content all within a web browser however there are several factors that really contributed to Flash's Decline and or Flash's programming declined and also to now it's completely discontinued so unless you're looking to learn something very vintage and old school there really is no point in learning this some of it being security concerns it had a history of security vulnerabilities which made it a target for hackers another being performance issues flash content often consumed significant system resources causing slow loading times High CPU usage and also time reduced battery life on mobile devices which as you can imagine in the early 2000s when smartphones were starting to come out further and further along time flash was just a big problem next up I wanted to do something for the third one here which was not necessarily a tech programming language related because I know we have a lot of viewers or a lot of people that watch these videos that are not programmers and the third one that I really wanted to highlight is agile the agile methodology and listen don't come at me with the butt Tiff but Tiff there's butts for everything we all have a butt that's kind of weird I don't know why I just said that but but you get the point what is the waterfall methodology well it essentially is when a team starts with a big plan and then they work their way through that plan throughout working their way through that plan there is no iterative Sprints there's no feedback there's no potential to Pivot you have a plan of what you are going to build and you have your focus you are building it whereas nowadays a lot of companies most companies use What's called the agile mythology which is you work in Sprints a lot of times it's two week Sprints for example you have tickets that you are working on uh specific to the Sprints so for example if you are in a product manager role you are assigning these tickets if you are in a developer role you are taking these tickets and you have this chunk of time where you are building after that time is done you meet and you iterate based on what you've learned from the Sprint feedback maybe from some customers bugs that have come up what this does is it prevents you from working in this kind of linear fashion where you can't see anything about the end goal in turn you can actually see what you are building and move pieces along the way now there's always as I mentioned there's always the butts when would waterfall methodology be used like when would is it still used and it really depends there are some companies out there that still find use for it today but definitely if you are looking to grow a career in Tech I would focus on agile versus waterfall next on the list is one that I heard about quite a bit actually and might be oh I feel like it says for every everyone might be very controversial but I don't think so which is Pearl scripting before we get into it let's talk about what exactly even is Pearl scripting maybe some of you don't know so Pearl scripting was a popular programming language scripting language I should say in the past and since the rise of say python Ruby and JavaScript it's really Fallen to the side however Pearl does still have some very Niche uses where it's really good to use of course the obvious one being Legacy system maintenance for systems that are already using Pearl it's definitely an area where you can continue to maintain and grow a career because it's very Niche now would I still learn it based on that absolutely not other areas though that Pearl is still used one is bioinformatics which Pearl has a long history actually of the use in bioinformatics and computer biology I feel like I Stumble over those words they're not common words I use bioinformatics and with many existing libraries and tools specifically designed for these fields such as let's say bio Pearl so because it already has a lot of these tools and libraries set in place it's still some companies go to and then also too it's used for text processing and manipulation Pearl has built-in support for advanced regular expressions and Powerful text manipulation features so it makes it a good choice for tasks such as data extraction parsing logs or transformation of text files so although there is still some use cases for Pearl I definitely do not think it is worth learning nowadays in 2023 when there is so much more out there to put your focus to last but definitely not least on the list is something I ordered dog food and this is what I get let's try that again last but definitely not least on the is Adobe cold fusion and this is something that I hadn't heard a lot about but I was really curious as to what it was used for so Adobe cold fusion is a web application development platform that was introduced in 1995 by Allaire alaire Corporation and later acquired by Adobe so cold fusion was used for creating Dynamic data-driven web development or web applications using a proprietary scripting language so some of the common use cases for it included CMS systems it was used to build and maintain CMS platforms e-commerce applications data driven applications and also to web services and apis sounds really interesting so why the decline of this technology well to a few factors one in which we are all very familiar with I hope anyways which is modern web development Technologies came around such as PHP love it or hate it PHP is one of it's the opposite of this list it's something that is still very in demand so many websites use it and I know it can be painful to pick up and learn or a lot of it's just a fussy programming language trust me it was my first my first job was with PHP and Symphony so I get it but also to Ruby on Rails JavaScript Frameworks they all emerged and they kind of offered similar or better capabilities and in turn because they were open source they were more cost effective for these companies another reason that cold fusion eventually declined and is no longer around is because of the learning curve and proprietary nature so as you know Tech is all about being open source and sharing information and with cold fusion and the proprietary nature and unique syntax that it had it made it less accessible to new developers and they didn't want to spend the time learning this these declined with many other factors made cold fusion not so cold anymore not so hot anymore gone you know what I mean all right those are the five technologies that I would not be learning in 2023 and will not be learning in the future unless something crazy changes and it comes up that I need to uh but I really really hope not anyways I'm curious to hear your thoughts do you agree with this do you disagree what are some other Technologies you would add leave in the comments let's have a good conversation around this and uh hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career related
