foreign welcome back to another episode of talk Tech 
with Tiff in this episode I sat down with Asaf   who is the head of design at stack bit we 
covered really what it takes to go through   a product design interview really in depth 
so when you leave this episode You Will Not   only understand the interviewing process but 
some really unique tips that he shared as well   he also shared more about his journey into 
product design and we ended the conversation   talking about some really cool Tech that we 
are working on because fun fact Asaf and I are   actually co-workers and this was the first time 
we met so the conversation was really inspiring   and interesting and I hope you enjoyed as well 
before we get into it make sure to subscribe to   my monthly newsletter I linked it down below 
it's completely free and features some really   unique discount codes uh job postings career 
advice and more okay let's dive into it [Music] welcome to talk Tech with Tiff the New York 
Edition where I am sitting down with industry   professionals to hear about their career 
Journeys and current roles I created this   series to hear from people who are established in 
the tech industry so that we can all learn what   these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and 
the type of opportunities out there [Music] hey   everyone we are sitting here or I am sitting here 
with a soft today highs off hello it's pretty   crazy well not crazy but really fun fact in my 
opinion this is uh with a fact I know we're coming   in hard with facts as often I have worked together 
for what six seven weeks now we're co-workers at   stack bit and we're going to get into stack a bit 
more uh later in this uh video but um this is our   first time meeting in person which is pretty 
cool I know I know remote yes whatever you want   to call it yeah you look like you know the same 
do I look like my photo because I feel like so because I feel like sometimes you're like you you 
know you have those conversations you're going to   meet someone in person you've just seen photos 
you're like that photo was from many years ago   yeah now I feel like you know the especially like 
folks with good quality uh cameras yeah it's okay   I was anticipating this okay okay maybe maybe 
you're slightly taller than I expected really   slightly I usually get shorter all right yeah 
you got taller yeah that's where you go yeah   okay let's get into it I I feel like I know a 
bit about yourself and your background where   you're just speaking about it but um share it 
again let's do a repeat but but for everyone   listening I know no all right um where do I start 
I think it's really interesting uh even from your   time back in Israel when you were talking about 
how you were starting out your first tech job   or you can arrest like all that just let's 
go way back way back so it All Began in 1990   um all right should I like should I go like 
school days whatever you want yeah all right cool   um I am someone who always thought about 
himself as a creative but always knew that   I'm not that good at it right so I was like 
I didn't really know how to draw I didn't   really know like everyone around me that did not 
consider themselves as creative yeah did better   like art yeah I mean um I also think like I 
was trying to get into like the like major in   art in high school and I didn't get into that 
yeah um ended up doing computers and something   um so yeah it was like always in the back of my 
head but never really I never really acted on it   um I'm from Israel I did um like 
a few years in in the military   um and you know my head was really somewhere 
else and then um Tech is pretty big in Israel   and I started hearing and this was I'm pretty old 
like no offense to everyone who's older than me   um but like this was around 20 to 2000 
and and four or five I'm sorry seven   seven eight yeah seven eight where I started 
like looking at what is it that I'm gonna do   um after I was out of the military and my wife 
who's who was an engineer back then in Tech   um started introducing to me like the fact 
that there's like designers designers work   in in their company and I was like huh 
and they make money like real money   um which was also something that I cared about 
yes um so I've learned that there are folks in   companies that are actually like producing 
like icons and illustrations and things like   that right it wasn't like considered ux or product 
design or anything like that it was like strictly   visual marketing um heard about another friend 
that went through this like path of something   that was called Visual Communications and and 
it was like it was really really really small   um so yeah that's the path that I chose and I 
started like going uh like I've tried going into   a few schools I ended up getting into um pretty 
awesome School in Israel um I'm not gonna name   it because no one cares but I went there and I 
was one of the few designers that I that I know   that from the very beginning was very targeted on 
I'm gonna design for Tech okay like I want to see   myself in a tech company I was curious about 
what that means and and I feel like from very   um early like this was 2000 I started 
school back like 2009 eight I think nine   um this was pretty rare for folks to like none 
of my professors came from that background   right like no one no one really they all 
came from like old school graphic design   um backgrounds um illustrators uh typographers 
Etc and suddenly like they're hearing that there's   like this shift in the industry and learning 
uh about all these like different roles that   um you can focus on so yeah that was kind of like 
what I did and I think like being super focused   on that from the very beginning kind of gave me 
an edge and I feel like back in the back then   I could have pointed at any startup and tell them 
hey uh oh for sure I can work here and they would   be like all right how much yeah so it was I was I 
felt very privileged to take that path although I   remember one of my very early mentors before I 
even got to school was like we were doing like   this school prep to get into art school and 
I remember the first thing they this guy told   us when he entered the room was if anyone here 
is trying to actually make a career they will   be profitable please step outside of the store 
now really it was like no one believed because   like graphic design yeah back then it was like 
you know still almost yeah it's still kind of   um I wouldn't say um what's that average like 
average or anyway they don't make any money yeah   yeah wow you okay so one thing you said is at that 
time you were like I could point at any startup   and you know like get hired get paid whatever and 
I'm not holding you to that exactly but but I I   feel you it was like not about me yeah no the 
quality no one the role itself yeah what about   now do you think that's still the case now or how 
has that shifted it is still the case it's amazing   that's really awesome well no that's that's that's 
very no I know not true it's not true yeah there   are like a few things a few boxes that you need to 
check yes but then if you check them it's pretty   true yeah yeah so like you and this is like an 
advice I will give to folks um I feel like it   was important to me because I'm quite uh I don't 
know this is not the most artistic or a pure way   to think about these things but I always thought 
about my career as a career not just as like   um artistic path and um and it was important 
to me that like I work in places that people   recognize obviously that's the American way to 
do it um and that will open doors yeah and then   I'll be able to have that freedom to do more of 
the things that I want to do again like pretty   um puristic of me like that line of thought but 
like it's working yeah it worked it worked it's   like the you know the first door that opened uh 
was working at Ideo then that opened a bunch of   doors for me then lift and now I feel like 
with these two things on my resume it's like   really and that's like just not saying great 
things about Silicon Valley in this industry   but really when folks see that you've worked 
here and there it's it's ridiculous like the   there's so much I don't know about like I haven't 
searched for a job for a while so I bet with   pandemic and everything it's been very hard for 
folks so I don't want to be insensitive to that   um but I'm saying like when like a few is back 
the the the like it was so saturated with with   open rolls right so like people were just like 
all right sure you've worked there come on yeah   without really understanding like the differences 
in folks uh in like the and in crafts and and   um different I don't know there's like it's it's 
a pretty broad spectrum of what product designer   yeah means yeah um well how would you define it 
or is that can you define it or is it just so   it's like how would you define an engineer right 
yeah that's true yeah it depends on the company   you work at what you're focusing on it depends 
on so I feel like every obviously every product   is very different yes so products are different 
Industries are different right uh and products   are different from the nature of like um you know 
is it a consumer thing is it an Enterprise thing   is it uh like what what devices is it focusing on 
right like is it something that needs to be more   um I don't know systemic versus something more 
delightful um so there's like such a huge range   of things um that I feel like designers can just 
if if I need to think about what's like a good   designer I will say like someone who really knows 
and being honest with themselves about what's   their strengths and what's their uh weaknesses or 
at least like no be very focused on what are the   things they want to do and then get their strength 
do that to that place yeah and then find the right   role for you yeah um because I can't say like you 
know every company really is so different yeah   um you mentioned okay so you Ideo Ideo and 
then lift all right going back before that   a little startup a little startup okay that's my 
question because you know not that little anymore they're actually a side Builder like really stack 
what's the name of our company what's the name of   our company today is a great site Builder love 
them that's awesome so that was that was the   first uh that was the first company I worked 
for when I moved to the US I started working   for them in Israel and then I moved here um 
and they were great about it and offered me   like to join the Palo Alto office I worked in 
the Bay Area yeah it was great what is what is   and once again I I know that it varies company 
to company but what is kind of across the board   like what is a typical interview process like 
for us for this or is this like horrible really   interview for designers um 
I know like the basic stuff   um when it's very different again startups 
versus um Ido which was quite unique   um but in general like working like interview 
process in Tech will be I would highly highly   recommend that you get a referral from someone you 
know that works in a company that will connect you   because it will just make everyone's life easier 
yeah and we'll probably help you shine faster but   let's say middle recruiter I think you first 
do man and seriously this is probably outdated   you will do a chat with a recruiter see that 
you're like a real human being yeah and your   qualifications seem reasonably like a good video 
yes um then you will probably do um a phone chat   with or like a like a virtual interview with one 
of the designers on like a a senior-ish designer   um on the team um again different companies do 
different uh things like it lift we would search   for dedicated um roles okay so the the whole like 
role management was around like who is the hiring   manager so the hiring manager will probably do a 
first interview with with the candidate and then   um after like there's like a portfolio review with 
like the recruiters and the hiring manager right   there that's the first filter and then you'll get 
to just have a quick chat with the hiring manager   see that you're like interest interesting person 
maybe review one or two um projects then you will   do sometimes you'll do an assignment okay yeah 
like hey if you choose a company now make it   better yeah right like those are the worst in my 
opinion they can be I like them really like I like   I I really like that part it's like a puzzle right 
it's like also it's like an opportunity to show   off true it's an opportunity to do some builds and 
whistles like it but also like it's it's because   it's an opportunity to show off sometimes people 
lose their like structured thinking and they lose   their systemic thinking and they end up doing 
something really flashy yeah instead of something   meaningful okay we totally which I love these are 
the best conversations when I don't even reference   the questions good one question I'm going to 
reference though because I want to Yes um I   want to get into something that we're both really 
excited about and I love hearing you talk about it   as well because you literally light up is um you 
know future Trends in design but more specifically   to Leading that into what we are doing at stack 
bit with CSI and how it's CSI CSI what is that I   know seriously what is it CSI there's a show what 
is this it's called CSI what does it stand for on   the show I don't know I've never ever watched it 
but it's crime scenes investigations I guess yeah   of course yes wow that's good am I right yeah and 
then ours is content Source interface so a little   bit different yeah and then Source interface 
yeah we're trying to ride the naming from SEO   perspective so um everyone is going to check out 
our SEO is going to be our CSI is going to be like   from from La trying to get like a role as a um 
someone as a bypass or someone who got killed in   this crime scene and okay so we're talking a lot 
about CSI and I'm gonna give like a a 20 second   overview of CSI and then how it relates to to 
this conversation but essentially what um we're   building at stack bet stack stack bit sorry the 
coffee's kicking in it's going really fast now   um or more specifically our engineering team 
has built stack beat Tech beat has built is   you can take any content source so whether it's 
apis whether it's a headless CMS database and   utilize CSI I haven't said it out loud too much 
CSI so I'm still getting like comfortable with   that I try to avoid it yeah but you can utilize 
you can then work with CSI and integrate it into   to your workflow so what this does is it allows 
you to um connect to some really cool stuff one   being figma which are solutions engineer Joe uh 
connected to figma's API and I'm going to pass   it on to you from here I'm just like putting you 
on spot with it but it's pretty amazing yeah so   figma was like I feel like an like not something 
that anyone had really in mind when buildings CSI   uh I've been thinking about like integration 
with figma from like the first time I met   um our Founders ohadendan where they introduced 
stacked me to me I was like all right so this is   kind of like a side Builder but way more Technical 
and like everything is react based react component   so I feel like there's something there that can 
click at some point yeah and I've tried to pitch   this a few times and I feel like we didn't 
really feel the that it had enough substance   until uh CSI showed up and really opened up the 
ability to integrate with like any content Source   any framework whatever you throw at it we can 
we can integrate with it at stack bit which is   um kind of like an man I'm definitely gonna say 
something that Simon our CTO is gonna hate later   but it feels to be like you know we're opening 
we're creating some sort of like an open sourcy   platform yeah kind of like you can integrate 
anything to it right like you can plug anything   so what does that mean for designers so in general 
designers we're not our Focus really because   um unlike no code Solutions no code Site 
Builders where the expectation is that the   designers will come in into like this platform 
and we'll be using the platform as their design   tool right like they'll be using uh like Wix 
webflow Squarespace uh this group uh and and   like we'll go there and use whatever that 
platform is offering them templates specific   design tools play with that some designers will 
be able to tweak more with some coding some not   um so that's one approach with stack but we 
were like okay we're not building a design   tool yeah we're building the integration and and 
all that and we will enable like visual editing   on top of of things but it's like it's going 
to be like pretty rigid like that's how we saw   the experience because we wanted this to be more 
focused on um you know creating Pages fast but but   but realizing and understanding the fact that hey 
for a large project large websites there's a large   team so and there's like dedicated developers 
yeah that are gonna do the heavy lifting of the   building because performance is important 
because the Frameworks used are important   um so that was the focus right like we're 
gonna give you developers everything they   need to build the most modern website but then 
we can neglect content creation so we're gonna   enable fast content creation on top of that but 
the design part of things uh was slightly kind   of like you know in the back of our mind but 
not really a focus because we were like okay   designers are building in figma developers 
will develop whatever they're building on   from figma on stack with and they will build 
it in a componentized way so we'll have compo   we we already have like designers uh can you end 
content creators can just use their components um   like their their crafted personal components that 
they created on figma on sketch or whatever they   did and and then they can reutilize them really 
fast with like you know a component Library great   and now suddenly um we were like huh actually 
we can like just seamlessly integrate figma into   um our structured content um our methodology 
yeah and what happened is Joe one of our solution   Engineers was able to create that integration and 
it was pretty it's still pretty mind-blowing yeah   it's still evolving but right now what he um kind 
of like unlocked is the ability for um designers   to sync their design system into um into stack bit 
meaning let's say you have a website on stack bit   you will usually what you'll do is you'll 
have your components kind of like build under   um like design system guidelines yeah and 
your design system and your components are   probably held in like uh in between products 
such as like storybook or something which is   which is all your components all your design 
system implemented in code right so you're   maintaining it basically on stack bit on on figma 
or whatever you're maintaining it on on storybook   yeah uh in code yeah and then you'll do it in like 
your web platform yes what not so that requires   a designer constantly updating and iterating and 
changing a developer one developer maintaining a   storybook or or a similar product and then someone 
doing the front end and like always syncing with   everything right um so what we're doing now is 
with stack but you're basically making changes   on figma and they automatically update um either 
on storybook or on uh it's not actually not sorry   they will be updating um we're we're integrating 
with storybook as well so you can either think   from storybook or from figma or skip one of them 
but it will automatically just update on on your   website on your live website so we started with 
tokens which is colors typography spacing all   that we're shifting into like component changes so 
you know you'll be able to easily change like The   Styling uh like a box a block a button whatever 
so that's already functioning working and we also   have a very clear path forward for how we're going 
to manipulate layouts uh create new components   with new models like our stack but we will be 
able to read proper content models from stack   from figma so yeah in theory and not so Theory 
and I I believe that very like soon with stack   bit you'll be able to just Define a new let's 
say section by dragging a few components that you   already have on your component library on figma 
and hit publish and then that section will show   up in your component library on stack bit and the 
whole thing is synced to your design system and   it's pretty magical it is really magic that is the 
future I know it is the future it's it's unlocking   so much potential it's it's like um I was trying 
to explain the value of this because the majority   of our team is not designers yeah I was trying 
to explain the value that I see in this and   I was like okay you're all developers right 
like say imagine that you're locked into the   um code editor of like the episode or whatever 
yeah but vs code but a limited vs code okay   like a viscode that sits inside like a no code 
uh um right like you have like a little window   that is kind of like curated according to what the 
platform allows so imagine you're coding in that   versus really coding on a local vs code right 
I see what you're saying yeah that to me is the   difference between trying to edit and tweak within 
stack bit or any other visual editor versus doing   the things in figma yeah in theory I can get 
the same results it will just take me 10 times   like slower yeah and it means for a lot more 
potential in mistakes along the way and it's   the inconsistency is real yeah it's real it's 
a real thing right like you have to maintain   consistency across three platforms yeah which is 
nuts it is nuts and it's not anymore why sold I   know I know I'm gonna link uh more information 
on down below because it's for anyone which is   pretty much everyone watching this interested 
in design or technology is really fascinating   um and uh yeah so link some resources down 
below also to get us off on this podcast I   promised him that everyone watching how to 
go follow his Twitter so I'm gonna link his   Twitter down below there's one 53 right now 
153 people following me right now which is   I guess embarrassing it's not embarrassing at 
all it's not embarrassing I'm not embarrassed   no and then by the time this goes live he wants 
at least a hundred thousand was that the I think   150k I feel like you're keeping on going up why 
not why not just keep on uh esophage was great   having you here thank you so much um thank 
you for the coffee yeah for sure and I guess   I'll see you virtually in two days back at work 
yes thanks everyone thank you foreign [Music]
