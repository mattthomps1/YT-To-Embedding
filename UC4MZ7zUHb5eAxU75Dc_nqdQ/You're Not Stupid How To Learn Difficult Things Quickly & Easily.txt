in this video I'm going to share with you 
some of the top ways top methods that have   been researched on studies have done about 
how you can learn more efficiently and really   ensure what you are learning sticks okay let's 
go oh if you haven't hit that subscribe button   support me and also leave in the comments other 
topics you want me to cover okay now let's go the first on the list is called retrieval practice 
and this is the concept of remembering at a   later time so how exactly does this help for one 
recalling an answer at a different time than when   you're actually learning the material actually 
helps reinforce learning more efficiently than   just trying to study in your textbook this is 
similar to the concept of flashcards actually   writing down what the answer is on a flash card 
and continuing to repeatedly look at it and   remember quiz yourself is way more effective than 
simply looking reading and thinking you you know   this if you are someone who practices retrieval 
learning it is more likely based on studies that   you will remember this information retain it 
for a longer period of time this is something   that I did a lot when I was studying in University 
especially with flashcards little tip Quizlet is   amazing for flash cards at the time when I was 
studying it was free I still think they have a   free version anyways we're getting sidetracked 
here I'm sharing on screen here some ways which   you can Implement retrieval practice the first 
one is utilize practice tests use practice   tests or quiz questions without looking at the 
books or notes another way is to make your own   questions essentially like be your own teacher 
create questions you think that would be on a   test if you're in a study group you can do this 
in a group setting where others make questions   that they think might be on a test and quiz each 
other and the way that we've spoken about so far   is flashcards create flash cards but make sure to 
practice with the retrieval technique instead of   just flipping a card over right away write the 
answer down and then check next on the list is   the Lightner system speaking of flashcards this 
system is a system that utilizes just that in this   system you will have different boxes and keep your 
flash cards in each of them now how exactly does   this work every card starts in box one if you get 
a card right you can move it to the next box if   you get a card wrong either move it a box down or 
if you're just starting keep it in that same box   trying to be interactive you know according to 
mindedge.com the Lightner system focuses on spaced   repetition and actively recalling the information 
and what this does is it allows for our brains   to absorb the information and process it more 
efficiently I'll put a little schedule on screen   here so every day you will have box one every two 
days box two every four days box three nine days   box 4 and 14 days box five maybe you're a visual 
learner like me and if this is the case mind   mapping is a great way to learn mind mapping is a 
technique that allows you to visually organize a   diagram in your mind so visualize this first you 
write a word in the center of a blank page from   there you write down the major ideas and keywords 
and connect them directly to the center concept   from here other ideas will continue to Branch 
out so how does this help us learn and remember   things better mind mapping is related to how our 
brains actually store and retrieve information   mind mapping your notes instead of just writing 
them out what it does is it can help improve   your reading comprehension it also allows for 
you to see the big picture by communicating the   hierarchy and relationships between the concepts 
so mind mapping is very helpful especially when   you are studying topics or learning something 
new a lot of times with technical topics that   there are different hierarchy points to it there's 
different connections to it and it's a great way   to visualize it out here's how to give my mapping 
a try first grab a blank sheet of paper and write   down your study topic such as JavaScript 
from there connect your main ideas to the   main topic then as you can visualize it out you 
can connect subdomain sub-branches of supporting   ideas to your main branch what I like to do 
when I've mind mapped mind mapped in the past   is use different colors for them for each branch 
and the connections no surprise here sleep is   critical for your brain function memory function 
and learning yet why do we always push it off   we want a journey today Studies have shown that 
studying right before you sleep actually helps   improve memorizing or understanding what you 
are learning according to a researcher from the   University of York in the UK when you are awake 
you learn new things but when you are asleep you   actually refine them making it easier to retrieve 
them and apply them correctly when you need them   the most this is important for how we learn 
but also how we might help retain healthy brain   functions so think of it as sleep as a win-win you 
get to relax go to sleep but you also are helping   improve your brain no one wants to study more than 
they need to let's be honest here so using some   of these techniques to learn more efficiently 
will not only help you retain information have   better recall but it will help you save time in 
the long term too many of us have been learning   in the wrong way and I say that meaning we get 
taught one way to learn and that's the only way   we can do it or that we've ever done it we need to 
start looking for other Alternatives other ways to   learn based on research and studies in order to 
find what works best for us at the end of the day   if you are someone working in Tech you're going to 
be consistently constantly learning so it's really   important to try out some of these methods and 
find what works best for you all right I think   I've done my work here for the day if you haven't 
already make sure to hit that subscribe button let   me know down below if you have tried any of these 
learning techniques and I'll see you all soon me
