oh I've been applying to so many jobs and no one is even taking time to interview me what am I doing wrong what's wrong with me this has been you before you're definitely not alone I remember when I was not only first starting out looking for jobs in Tech but also too as you can progress in your career there are oftentimes throughout your job hunting process where you have these thoughts is something wrong with me is there something I'm missing why is no one taking time to interview me is it me is it them is it the economy what is going on these are all common thoughts and in today's video I'm going to be walking you through some common mistakes that you might be making when you are looking or applying to technical jobs now this is something that after almost six years in the tech industry as a software developer as someone who works in developer relations I have been both on the side of applying to these jobs and also too on the hiring side looking at these resumes thinking I remember being in these people's shoes I can't believe this person made this mistake why did they not include this why did they include this and I'm going to share with them all them all with you today before we jump into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related videos and enough of me talking let's just get into it [Music] okay this might be a little controversial to hear well maybe it goes against a lot of what we're told especially when we're starting out is you might just be applying for jobs you are under qualified for it we hear so often or at least I did anyways when I was starting out and even today apply for jobs even if you're not qualified apply for jobs even if you're not qualified but should you be now there's a fine line here oftentimes when we go online especially if you are someone looking for a more Junior position you will see positions for junior software developer you need at least three years experience well how am I going to get those three years experience if you need three years to start with it's it's beyond don't even get me started on that but the reality is a lot of times maybe if you're not hearing absolutely anything back or very little take a step back and look at the jobs you're applying for if you're applying for something that's more of a junior role how many years of experience are typically on the jobs that you're applying for because if you are applying for a senior level or above jobs are you really going to hear back now there isn't anything wrong with applying to these jobs I think go for it apply for these jobs I know for me actually share with you a little personal experience when I was looking for my most recent position there were there was a few companies where I was like this is my dream job I mean I love where I work right now and it's it's now my dream job but you know at the times like this is a great company this is exactly what I want to do but they were more so for director level positions and and in the description it was like you need 10 to 15 years experience Etc et cetera it's like I do not have 10 to 15 years experience in developer relations but I take off literally all the boxes they are asking for so I just applied anyways now I actually got back I think out of the three for those direct positions I actually got back two uh interviews but I actually I don't think I followed through with them for various reasons but the point being is I knew that that was a long shot and even though I got maybe those interviews initially I knew it was a long shot and actually securing that job but I thought you know what why not apply and just see what happens so I'm not saying don't apply for roles are outside of your proximity for experience but if you are applying for those roles that are typically uh more qualified than what you are at make sure you are also applying for roles which you're like yes that is in my realm that is in my experience otherwise if you're just applying for all these roles that are a bit Out Of Reach and you're hearing nothing back it's going to get discouraging really fast and at the end of the day you need to be realistic you're not going to we have to take our ego I say this so much because it's so true though you have to take your ego out of the job you have to take your ego out of your career don't think you are too good to apply for a job or that you're too good for this job now what I mean by that is I remember so often and if some of you been watching my videos for a while you've heard this when I graduate from my coding boot camp there were people who were like I'm only working at these companies and I need to make this amount of money to start with do you know where the majority of those people are working now not in Tech because they wouldn't let themselves realize that maybe maybe I'm not where I think I'm at and I just need to get my foot in the door and grow from there that was a long rant I feel like I'm very passionate about this subject you're lucky you can't see my hands because they're like I feel like I like Italian right now I'm very emotional I speak Italian just because you have a mustache because it's just I don't know I get so passionate about this because I think it's so easy to really screw yourself over if you're not letting your ego out the door so okay tip it's enough for that one moving on to the next one the second is not tailing your resume or cover letter let's let's not even pretend we all haven't done this before I am very guilty of it too where you are in the midst of job hunting and you're tired job hunting essentially is true truly a full-time job and sometimes you just don't want to put in 110 that day so you send off a resume and cover letter and you don't customize it well what is what's the big deal why does this even really matter well there are a few things one being when you don't take the time to customize it based on what they are looking for keywords they are including if they are using an AI to first screen your resume if your resume you might be perfect for this job but if your resume doesn't touch on the keywords and what they are talking about you're going to get missed and this really really really sucks especially too I remember when I was hiring for what was it for it was for a junior software developer role and the amount we would get in hundreds hundreds a day of applications and a lot of these would just be automated so they would write a python script I'm assuming and just like push the resume out to as many people as possible honestly I don't think we even looked at any of those because it wasn't they had no they didn't have any care into the company or any stake in the company they didn't care about the company they just wanted a job and hey that's totally fine but you at least have to pretend to care and play the game to make companies notice you if you are feeling like you are burnt out and tired of applying to jobs and take time off of this it's better to do quality over quantity in this sense that if you're like I just can't apply to more today or I just don't feel like it today then don't don't just continue pushing forward but versus taking time off relaxing it's not going to set you back what it will do is when you aren't actually applying take time and apply to each job with thought and with care include those keywords it's so vital this isn't new this isn't something that you haven't heard before but so often do we actually just brush it off when in turn it can be the make or breaking point of if you get that first interview also as a side note what I used to do when I was applying to jobs if there was a company that I was super interested in and I knew there'd be a lot of competition I would send off my resume and cover letter and then I would also send them a LinkedIn message so the hiring recruiter and then sometimes even one or two other people it shows you're very eager which is not a bad thing and saying I just sent off my resume and cover letter I'm very interested interested in this position and here is why and this will really show them that you are someone who isn't afraid to take initiative that you're actually really interested in the company that they are working at and you care about it you position yourself in a place that you stand out from the crowd at the very least they will take time to look through your resume also make sure to include your resume again in that message number three on this list is not using your network and don't give me this excuse up chip I don't have a network I don't know anyone in the tech industry because guess what I didn't either before I broke into it so how did I manage to do it I made a network and that's what you need to do too just reach out to people on LinkedIn you know I know it's terrifying I know it's scary and I know it sucks it's not fun putting yourself in these vulnerable situations where it's just like can I connect over virtual coffee or you know I love what you're doing like let's connect it's just it sucks it's not fun and if you think it's fun I wish I had that emotion or skill because I don't think it's fun at all but it's how you see results quickly is through connecting and building relationships with other and even if you feel like you don't have any direct contacts within the tech industry or for the role you are applying for that is okay what I think is the best thing to do then is to start sharing with others you are looking for a job looking for a role in Tech whatever specific one it is and more often than not through just engaging in these conversations with your friends to be like oh my you know my cousin of a cousin or whatever the case is they work in Tech why don't you connect with them so start really thinking about your network and utilizing it because if you are just sitting there and applying for jobs without reaching out to others it's going to be a longer haul typically in finding your job versus if you're actually using your connections or potential connections the last one on the list is trying to memorize and have everything perfect for your first phone call and this often times I see happen that we take advice too far where we you know so be prepared practice your answers okay yes have answers prepared be you know on top of your game but you don't want to become to the point where you're in the initial screening call and you sound like a robot you're just listing off your answers and it's obvious that you are just memorized answers and are just saying them and I think part of the thing is even if you aren't applying for a technical role people hire people they don't just hire skills and you can push back and say this isn't true and maybe in some instances it isn't the full truth but people on average want good people to work for them to work with good people and if that means hiring someone who's very authentic and real has a great personality and is a team player more likely than not companies will hire that person over someone who might be more a bit more qualified skillfully but has no sign of wanting to work together in teams or be friendly because skills can be taught skills can be learned over time and if you have someone who maybe is a little bit less skilled technically but has a lot more eagerness and willingness to grow I don't know about you but I'd rather hire and work for that person versus someone who maybe currently has more skills but it seems very stagnant so going back to not memorizing your answers well when you're going on these phone calls yes have things prepared but don't be a robot be authentic and be truthful if they ask you a question and you don't know the answer that is okay just be honest be you know and it might be something where you're just you should know the answer and you're a bit nervous now in initial phone calls screening interviews are not going to necessarily ask technical questions but what they will do is they might ask you how much you know about this technology or what your experience is with this and if you stumble or get caught up on some sections just take a step back and be honest say hey you know what I really want to work for X company and I'm kind of nervous right now I usually know how to answer this but I'm feeling a little nervous let me get back to you on this at the end of the interview could you ask me it again it gives you some time to collect yourself recollect your thoughts continue on with the conversation that by the end of the conversation you're feeling more comfortable having spoken to them for a while that it's easier to revisit this question that you are having some difficulties with okay those are the top four common mistakes that I have not only seen but have personally made and I wish I had advice along a lot of these actually all of them pretty much are is advice that goes against what is typically told I think I gave a lot of advice here that goes against the grain because sometimes we take this advice too seriously and we need to step back and actually go the opposite way which I just shared with you today I hope you found these tips really valuable and helpful not only if you are just starting out in your Tech Career but no matter where you're at in your journey I think interviewing is something that is terrifying at all stages or at least for me it is I don't like interviewing and I like talking to people but it's one of those things that the more you practice the better you will get at it and just be yourself because at the end of the day you want to work for someone who really values and respects your true self all right
