hi hi happy to have you here I'm really excited to be here today what are some skills you have what are some skills that I possess well I am very proficient in coding can code and JavaScript python Java C plus plus um I'm also to I'm a ux UI designer I can design different applications for you really great at SEO too and I can do all those skills and it takes me seconds you can do all that automated well I have other skills too I I mean did you did you even look at my resume it's very long all the skills like I can do all those too you can do them all too um okay then well thank you for your time goodbye is this the future that we are all in for where robots can literally do everything we can do but better what does it mean when we look ahead till 2030 what skills will be in demand will our jobs even be in demand what can we do now to prepare for the future we have seen that Tech grows and changes so quickly we cannot go look back at history to see how quickly it's changed because for example with AI we've seen that the curve was relatively going like this and then even within the last eight months it just went skyrocketed this will continue to happen in more areas than we have ever seen before reason being Tech is accelerating faster than ever and as it continues to accelerate that acceleration process will continue to go faster and faster the reality is no one knows what the future looks like but there are definitely some experts some really great companies out there that spend a lot of time researching as to what the future of work may look like you know this is a topic that I am obsessed with mainly because I love learning and growing skills and I'm really excited about the future and how our roles whether a developer UI ux designer project manager whatever role you are in technical or soft skill will evolve and you will be able to stay ahead of the curve as long as you are willing to and open-minded also before we get into this video hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related content and leave in the comments other videos you want me to cover any questions you have I do my absolute best to answer every single one of your questions alright let's get into it foreign now this is just my prediction based on someone who's been in the tech industry for quite a while now and has been a software developer professionally networking developer relations whatever this feel is you get the point my prediction is that a lot of these different roles will become merged meaning I think over time we will continue to see more project managers being able to code designers being able to code developers being able to design like a lot of these roles I believe will become more closely intertwined the reason being is because a lot of these roles there's going to be so much more access to getting into them even coding for example now there are so many tools to really help you code that even if you're not a proficient coder and maybe your role isn't fully software engineer you can use these AI tools to help you build or understand code and same goes with all these other rules as well which I think is pretty exciting if my prediction goes this direction and is correct because it means that you will get to wear many different hats now this isn't to say that traditional role goals of being a complete expert as a software engineer or designer will become extinct those will still be needed but more so there's a lot of opportunity for people who are interested in wearing many different hats trying different Technologies I think that those are the people who really succeed in the next 10 years but enough of my take in what I think let's hear from the ex let's hear from the experts you can tell I need some more of this coffee so the first skill on the list is something that shouldn't come as a surprise to you which is digital literacy and actually according to the world economic Forum by 2030 over half more than half the jobs we do will require an understanding of digital technology they actually go as far as to say people who lack digital literacy will be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to competing for jobs and business opportunities by 2030. so this is a very bold statement to make by the world economic Forum stating that over half the jobs by 2030 will require an understanding of digital technology now I'm curious to hear do you agree with this do you think this is accurate for me I definitely think it is because as we've seen Tech is not just an industry on its own technology impacts every single industry so whether you are a developer designer whatever the case is you do not need to specifically work at a tech company all these under other Industries will need you to continue to work in them to bring them to the Forefront all businesses now a day or most of them need to be online or it's going in that direction so having technical individuals will become more and more important now you might be saying well tip this isn't a specific skill digital literacy could mean many things and I think this is really important to know because there is no one way to have digital literacy and I think that's the beauty of it you could have cyber security you could be an expert in a specific programming language or designer But continuing to be up to date with what is going on in Tech will continue to be even more important than it is today now let's get into a specific skill or a specific area that will continue to be in demand which hopefully is no surprise to you cyber security this is an area that even my dad I kid you not my dad called me one day he's like Tiff I keep on seeing about how important cyber security is on the news you need to get into cyber security dad you know I feel like I've gone too far down the developer relations path I really appreciate that I definitely agree with you if I was to do it all over again it's probably where I would end up is cyber security actually fun fact here it says 1.7 Million results on Google search for the term cyber security jobs that are over a hundred thousand USD for salary there is a lot of opportunity in this space and as everything continues to go online more and more the need for cyber Security Experts will continue to Skyrocket this is probably you can quote me on this in a few years but this is probably the most important area that is not only for today if you are looking for a job that will be secure for a long time but also by 2030. cyber Security Experts will not be overtaken by AI or automation you need the human touch the human intelligence to understand what is good what is bad what is allowed what we should prevent what we should not prevent there's so many different things so this in my opinion is the number one skill to learn if you want to continue to be in demand for 2030. now the next question might be well how do I get into cyber security the good thing is because this is probably now one of the best times to get into cyber security actually because there is a need for so many more cyber Security Experts that they aren't having this very hard limit that you you need to graduate with this specific degree to get into cyber security they need people so if you are willing to spend the time taking a course online or a certification online whatever the case is there is a job for you that's that's as far as you need to go you need to be passionate willing to learn take a course or some certification to show that you are really taking initiative and from there I'm not saying it's as easy as one two three but you do not need to go back to University necessarily to get into cyber security Now this can depend on what role you want to do so do research on it of course but at the end of the day the demand is so high for these roles or people with these skills that you do not need to necessarily go back to University or college just start by doing your research and probably just take a course online next up I found this skill or this trait to be super interesting and it is actually backed up or said by a Silicon Valley based investor named Zoar zor arwa I'm pronouncing this wrong I really apologize I hate pronouncing names wrong this individual says the next decade of I.T will be an age of shared cognition driven by increasing adoption of cognitive technology ongoing concerns about the scarcity of human attention and a need for independent individuals of trust which have yet to be developed so what does this mean what is this person predicting essentially it means the willingness and ability to partner with AI not only on decisions but also too on executions now this is looking ahead to 2030 but we see this happening already right now we see that there is this friction between developers or individuals who are willing and open-minded to using Ai and what it has to offer and then we see this other side of individuals who think no we are not even going to touch AI it is scary it's not for us or maybe they don't even think it's scary but it's bad or we're not using our own minds there's a lot of thoughts going on right now and I completely can see both sides of that right now there is a lot of the unknown right now and what he is predicting is in the future we will use AI alongside us and I really think this is extraordinarily uh the way of the future and going to happen we see it happening already and it will continue that way AI is not going to get Dumber it's just going to get smarter and smarter and the people who will continue to evolve and really grow in the next few years will be the ones who are open-minded and actually embrace these AI Technologies McKinsey Global recently did a study or a research report that highlighted the top three skill sets workers will need to secure the best careers and here are the top three they list hire cognitive so these can include Advanced literacy writing critical thinking quantitative analysis and statistical skills so doctors accountants analysts writers different things like that you're really using your higher cognitive skills another being social and emotional this I found very interesting this could include advanced communication empathy to be adaptable and the ability to continuously learn the ability to continuously learn let me say that one more time no you won't but I think that's so important because they're not just speaking about the tech industry they're speaking about the world as a whole and what skills will be in demand and I think that really though is so important in the tech industry do not if you are someone who just wants a job and does not want to learn any further skill sets I really do not think the tech industry is for you you need to be continuing to learn and grow not becoming obsessed with it and it takes over everything but just the awareness and what the yearning to continue to self-improve and continue to grow your mind and your skill set the third being technological everything from basic to Advanced I.T skills data analysts and Engineering these future skills of Technology are the most likely to be high paid so anyone who is technical in 2030 they are predicting will be the highest paid now I'm not surprised by this as technology is continuing to grow and I know some of you might be like well Tiff hey is going to take over our jobs AI is going to do all this coding for us yes it will be doing more of the smaller tasks and you'll as a technical person will continue to evolve your skill sets we might not even know what skill sets are needed yet by 2030 because we they might not exist but you need to be Technical and have that basic understanding in order to get to the second step that's something I always see nowadays is people are like well I'm not learning web development or I'm not learning how to code because AI can do it now well yeah that's great but you still need to learn the foundation these fundamentals in order to get ahead of AI and if you're never willing to learn the basics then you will never get ahead that's just a little round there anyways very interesting top three skill sets and with that when we speak about data analysis of course that means data scientists data analysts they will continue to be very in demand this is such a great area to get into as more companies are continuing to want to understand their data where they should be putting their effort and research okay and if we want to look ahead to specific career paths to go for 2030 here's what simply learn States or done their research on will be the top eight and let's go through that data science we already touched on that cloud computing this shouldn't come as a surprise as more and more companies are going towards the cloud digital marketing this one I don't know if I fully agree with I think it will be in demand but will be in the top eight I I don't know about that curious to hear your thoughts machine learning artificial intelligence augmented reality I think augmented reality is an area that is so untouched still we are making progress with it but there's so much more we can unlock with ar so if that does not of interest to you leave in the comments because I think there's a lot of potential there uh software development which can take on many forms and cyber security those lists for the most part make sense to me for the top 8 best jobs for the future by 2030. 2030 is really less than seven years away but as we've seen these advancements and changes that have happened this year alone we know that there will probably be jobs on that list that do not exist today which is really exciting the best thing you can do though to prepare for the future of work is being open-minded it's not a skill set it's not a specific thing you need to learn just open your mind to what is to come question things don't just jump on every single Trend I know AI is trending right now maybe it will be kind of like the web three where it's high and then it has its fall but at the end of the day be open to learning new things stay on your Pat your track though of of what your goals are don't completely go off path every time a new tech hype comes up is super important work looking ahead will continue to be more flexible working from anywhere Global Citizens you might work for a company you might be based out of India working for an American company or vice versa working with I mean even right now for me a lot of my colleagues work in Israel some of them work in Ukraine some of them work in different places in Europe it's really interesting and I think it's a beautiful thing because you learn about others cultures you get to connect with people have an agile schedule which means you can also on the side when you're not working be creating be building a business whatever you are passionate about learning something completely different that is what I think the future work will look like all right I hope you enjoyed this video and found it not only educational but also to inspire relational in the sense of don't worry about is my job going to be in demand tomorrow worry about what you are doing to prepare yourself for the future meaning don't worry about I get so many messages tiffs try get into data science will it be to match I even study computer science will be in demand yes if it is your passion study it because you need that foundation and then once you have that you will continue to evolve past where AI or automation is as technology advances you need to start from somewhere all right leave any questions down below as I mentioned earlier in this video I do my best to answer every single one of them and I will see you all soon I think I've had too much coffee now okay bye everyone foreign [Music]
