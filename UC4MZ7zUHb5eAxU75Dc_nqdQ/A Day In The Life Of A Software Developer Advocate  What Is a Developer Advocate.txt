Hello friends can we check out the Tiffin Tech 
March the merch that isn't merch because I'm not   selling it right now anyways maybe one day but 
for now just internally high energy Tiffany okay take two take three take four I don't know today 
we are going to be talking about my journey into   developer advocacy and developer relations 
this is a question I've been getting asked a   lot recently is what exactly is a developer 
Advocate what do you do and today I want to   talk to you about what I do coming from five 
years of strictly software development into   developer relations I'm going to share with you 
about what I do on a day-to-day basis uh what it   really entails to be a developer Advocate and 
hopefully give you kind of more insight into   to what I do but also to to the role itself 
and if I seem a little confused when I say   that it's because giving you insight into the 
role itself really varies uh company to company   person to person and I'll get more into that 
throughout this video but hopefully you will   leave this video with knowledge on what the heck 
do I do and also what a developer Advocate is to   maybe see if it's right for you maybe you're 
a software developer right now maybe you're in   Tech in another area or maybe you're just getting 
into Tech and want to know about it also before   we get into it make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more Tech coding career life videos   leave in the comments other topics you want 
me to cover as you know this is how I make my   videos is based on what questions you have what 
you want to hear from me okay let's get started but I'll go somewhere else okay when I started 
making this video I was going to do a vlog style   and I promise you more Vlogs are coming to Tiffin 
Tech about my day-to-day routine but as many days   they're crazy busy so rather than vlogging I'm 
just going to walk you through my day the first   thing I've been doing recently in the morning 
actually before we get into developer relations   and that just to tell you a little bit about 
my morning is I've been going to work out in   the morning so I get up at six every day leave 
the house by around 6 30 and go to Pilates and   this has really helped me gain Focus throughout 
the day I felt like my days were often so fuzzy   and I was tired and I just needed that boost of 
energy and honestly working out in the morning   has been a huge Savior for that I feel like then 
now throughout my days I'm more productive more   focused and honestly more happy when I get back 
from my workout I always take some time to do some   Tiff and Tech emails and focus on that for the 
first part from I would say about eight to nine   my workout's from seven to seven fifty get back 
do Tiffin Tech content and emails and then at 9   I start my day now there are really three main 
areas that I focus on in developer advocacy one   being developer education another being content 
and the last being community and a lot of times   these three pillars overlap of course you know 
with content being for developers with Community   intertwining with developer experience so it's 
all kind of intertwined in a way or oftentimes   it is but then there are times where the content 
is on its own the community is on its own focus   and the developer education is as well and 
why at the beginning of this video I was like   kind of looking confused or laughing to myself is 
because from company to company developer advocacy   or developer relations can really vary and what I 
mean by that is I was actually just looking at job   postings for developer Advocates not because I'm 
looking for a job at all but because I just like   to see what other companies are looking for what 
they're doing in that space I just find it really   interesting and good to ensure that the skills 
I am building and where working towards aligned   with what is in demand of course and at the end 
of the day the most important thing is serving   the company and working at and ensuring that we're 
meeting our goals and finding ways to do that that   I'm growing as well too so one of the things I 
noticed though is there's a lot of variety that   can happen in these job postings so for example 
I saw a company hiring for a developer Advocate   and half of the time it said 50 of the time you 
will be coding and then there's some developer   Advocates where they work under the marketing team 
so they actually don't code that much but you have   to have a very strong knowledge of Technology of 
coding depending on what the product is that you   you are advocating for so what is a developer 
Advocate I'm actually going to get my phone and   see what it says on here on the on the internet 
the internet knows uh what is a developer this   is what says the first thing that comes up for 
me anyways a developer Advocate accessibility   the liaison between an organization station and 
its relevant developer Community or communities   the main responsibilities are to help the 
developer Community do better work faster   and more efficiently and yeah I would agree 
with that for the most part I think that sums   it up in a pretty nice nutshell okay my camera 
just died let me though go back a little bit I   was thinking well I was charging actually but how 
to frame this so I want to share with you exactly   why I ended up going into developer relations 
and leaving software development on its own   I have been doing software development full-time 
both front and back end for five years and it was   great I got promoted at my last company to senior 
developer very quickly I started to lead a team of   developers it was great I was working in angular 
at the time really enjoying it and everything was   going good so many skills that I wasn't utilizing 
doing purely software development and I think one   of the main things was I really wanted to start 
connecting with others talking to other people   sharing basically doing what I do at Tiffin Tech 
but with a company and why I chose to go down   that path is I love doing coding and technical 
things but I also love the community building   and teaching aspect and I just felt like in my 
career if I looked a long term how I wanted it   to progress it wasn't going purely the technical 
way it wasn't purely code encoding coding software   development I was progressing my career in that 
way and I just wasn't feeling fulfilled I felt   like there was so much more I could offer into 
what my skill sets were and that's not to say   you can't have an amazing career being a software 
developer and growing it that way it just I knew I   wanted to really find the mix between soft skills 
and technical skills now to get into developer   relations and developer advocacy what skills do 
you need this is a question I get asked a lot   if you don't have developer experience can you 
become one and I think yes you could definitely   become a developer Advocate without the technical 
experience but it'd be very difficult meaning you   are speaking to developers you're often building 
tutorials for developers showing code on screen   solving their technical problems no you have 
to you have to be a developer before I think   at least to some degree or at least have very 
strong skills to develop maybe you only were   a developer for a year or two years but you need 
something there and that goes to the next question   is well do you code in this role and once again 
that can vary company to company some developer   Advocates as I mentioned they code all the time 
others don't and for me I when I'm how I like to   look at it is you aren't building for production 
you're building for other developers so this might   be through doing demos getting on webinars with 
other developer Advocates and building a project   with them making video tutorials answering 
questions in Discord different things like   that so you get to still flex your coding skills 
to varying degrees but you're quoting knowledge   in this role and one of the things though that 
I was nervous about getting into this role is   am I going to lose my technical skills and I 
think that's a huge fear that a lot of people   have if they're considering going into this role 
for me it wasn't a long-lived it was a short-lived   fear I guess you could say mainly because I have 
Tiffin Tech where I do different code with me's   I build cool things cool technology cool coding 
projects with you so I knew it wasn't something   that I would lose but rather just find other ways 
to do it and to me that was really exciting so   I absolutely love what I do it is a combination 
of as I mentioned those three pillars so working   directly with the community if people who are 
using your product have questions like developers   have questions around it also to sharing and 
educating about our tool that we make and how it   can be integrated into other projects the really 
good thing the company I work for is called stack   bit and the really good thing about it is it works 
with many many different Frameworks so it's not as   though I am honed in on one specific technology 
it can allow for many different Technologies to   work with which I really love and get excited 
about because then you're speaking to people who   are using many different Technologies as well 
and I think my favorite part of this role is   getting to flex men wear many hats Flex different 
skill sets and one of the challenging things I   would say about this role is around Community 
you're working towards building a community   but a quality Community I should say and what I 
mean by that is quality essentially meaning people   who are using your product are excited about your 
product maybe you're targeting A specific group   of people meaning people who work at large 
Enterprises or individual developers who are   Freelancers whatever the case may be that's what I 
mean when I say quality is having a very specific   target market and building a community around 
that and that is probably one of the biggest   challenges because with that it's you have to be 
authentic and find your voice but also to provide   value it's like it's a very challenging thing 
which is exciting though an exciting challenge   I think and that's really what it is so I'll 
give you a little a little insight as to what   my day today for example uh entailed I started 
my morning when I started work it's now I think   it's almost six here so when I started my day 
I started with a few meetings so I met with the   developer relations engineer we meet once a week 
and kind of talk about what he is working on here   for focuses a lot on documentation and then we 
it's really great when we connect because we can   talk about how the documentation can be turned 
into content and shared and also to I give him   updates on what I'm working on and focusing on for 
the week then after that meeting I had an outbound   meeting I think that's what it's called upon 
meaning I met with another developer relations   individual at another company and we are working 
on building out a demo project that will be we'll   be doing a webinar around using his technology at 
his company and mine at my company which is going   to be really cool and exciting and that was they 
had those two meetings and then I took some time   to work on a video I have been creating around 
how our product works at a high level so this is   a video that is for Developers for a developers 
page we are working on and it goes a little bit   into how to integrate the tool initially with a 
product project I should say then after that I had   lunch I had two more meetings one with a design 
individual one with the developer experience   person who we connect with as well he is always 
building really cool projects and I always connect   with him on what he is working on too then after 
that what did I do today after that I continued   on the video I was working on the how it works 
video and then I did research For an upcoming   webinar that we were doing another demo one so 
it's a lot of media things research building   content oh and then I didn't and then making sure 
Discord is functioning well meaning if anyone has   a question around it but this could vary day to 
day once again it might be more so preparing for   a webinar a few days ago I gave a demo and it was 
not targeted towards just developers so it had to   be more higher level but it's really cool I just I 
absolutely love this role I think it's a great way   to really grow your career I'm super passionate 
about growing my career and continuing to   level up step up and this just seems like a 
great balance between getting to interact with   leadership and a lot of wonderful individuals not 
only within the company I work for but externally   and build that network but also to keep your 
technical skills up and yeah I I don't know if   I did a good job of this I'm gonna do vlogs 
of day in the life of a developer Advocate   it's just today this week has been nuts but a 
vlog will come soon and in the meantime if you   have any questions I didn't answer around it 
leave in the comments and I will answer them   as you know I answer every single comment and 
okay it's been a day I love you all and I will   see you all soon thanks everyone hit that
