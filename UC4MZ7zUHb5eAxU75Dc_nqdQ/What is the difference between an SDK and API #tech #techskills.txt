what is the difference between an SDK and an API to be honest with you even as a developer when I first started out for too long I couldn't really understanding what the difference is at the time I was just working with apis I thought SDK I'll deal with it later let's start with an SDK because I feel like more people are familiar with apis and sdks you can think of as a collection of software tools documentation code samples and sometimes even includes apis whereas an API enables different communication between software components or systems that's super simplified but you get the point okay let's do a real world exam though so we're building a weather app with an API in this example the API will give you the data to use in the weather app whereas the SDK will provide a set of tools to use within the specific platform
