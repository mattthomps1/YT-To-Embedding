if you are thinking of starting a career in Tech but wondering am I too old you are definitely not alone with the tech industry changing so rapidly new Innovations continuing to come up people seem to be getting younger and younger did you did you just call me old no I'm I'm not calling you old I'm just I'm saying it can be more intimidating the older you get for example you might feel like you can't keep up there is so much to know also with age comes a lot more responsibility family bills the appeal to take a risk especially from breaking into a new industry when it really focuses on you know are you going to be leaving a job are you going to be leaving a different industry all of that it's a lot of pressure so the risk factor goes up immensely or it feels that way in reality though your life experience is much more valuable than you realize I remember when I went from Fashion to Tech I at first thought I have no experience in this industry no one is going going to hire me but when I started talking to people talking to mentors talking to experts in the industry I quickly realized that my unique background my unique experience is so valuable in the tech industry and it's all about how you spin it it really is never too late to break into Tech and you know you can stop the video at this point you've got your answer but more importantly today we are going to be talking about some tips when you are breaking into Tech at a I use this with quotes older age whatever that may mean to you okay okay I can actually really relate to that okay good I'm glad we got this sorted out here foreign first it's important to keep in mind that Tech is an all-encompassing industry it doesn't just mean that you have to code 24 whoa it got really orange I'm at my parents house this week filming and this was my childhood bedroom I was really into the sunset that's what we were going for here okay we need to go a different room this is a little too orange we're getting off track here okay that's much better also check out the cool staircase behind me it was one of my favorite things growing up essentially every industry when you really sit down and think about whether it be Fashion sports media beauty they all have a tech component so what does this really mean what this means is that whatever industry you are coming from whatever experience you have you have relevant experience it might not be directed into the tech industry per se that you're working on the tech side of things also side note working on the tech side of things doesn't mean coding again it could be working in marketing it could be working in HR but focused on the technical side of things focus on working with technical people uh focused on working on the tech product that is what it means actually really fun fact according to the Computing technology Association in 2021 there were 3.6 million 3.6 million job openings in North America or I think it's the United States actually I'm just looking at my phone here with the stats United States alone that opportunity those numbers are massive but I know what you're probably thinking even with all this data all this information to if I still feel really intimidated to break into Tech at my age and once again that could be whatever age you're at oh geez it's so bright don't be surprised but where does this fear come from I stayed at the beginning of this video that it's often in many cases and my mind included was coming from a place of questioning yourself of self-doubt of self-worth and it keeps on getting more intense the older we get because as I mentioned the the risk factor continues to go up and that's a huge thing so I think the most important thing is to recognize if you are wondering am I too old to break into Tech is this for me to really understand why you're having these insecure feelings why you're having these feelings and I think if we want to take it one step further let's look a little bit about the history of the tech industry as far as at least things that are popular go and what I mean by that is if you really look at you know social media when it comes to Instagram when it comes to Facebook even when it comes to you know Microsoft all these large companies the founder started when they were very young and that has been so hyped so praised in the media and in these articles because it makes a good headline Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook when he was 20 years old I'm not actually sure how old he was but you get the point when they're starting when they're so young it's really glorified that these young people are starting these successful companies and becoming quote unquote billionaires what seems like overnight and I really think that is why this question of am I too old to get into the tech industry has really become so such a big topic the other side of things which I think is why this question has become such a big topic is because Tech is probably the most in-demand industry or one of them definitely and I think with that there are so many job openings coming up many of we just spoke about 3.6 million that it comes that there's this demand for people but people have this hesitation am I too old to break into this industry am I going to be working with 19 year olds because honestly maybe you don't want to just work with a bunch of kids and that's another thing too I really want to touch on is that going to be the case and for me I started I wasn't I I wasn't quote unquote older when I started in my career in Tech but I was still later than the average person but I was still older than the average person and I think one thing that I had to overcome was ego meaning when I was in my first company first startup I had a manager who was a bit younger than me and I mean very I think like two years younger so not a lot but when you're in your 20s that difference age difference seems like a really big deal and for me I really had to let go of my ego when it came to well I should be where that person is because I'm older than them and I think that's something that you really have to let go when you are starting in Tech then the flip side of this which is a really promising thing I guess you could say is you can grow very quickly in your career so although I started out behind that person I would say now where I am today I am on par if not head and that's not a Breaking Point or a look at me point but it's really to highlight that however much work you want to put into your career and you your career grows you can get that very quickly if you do it strategically okay we are going to get very personal you know we always we just we connect on I think it's so important to be very personal so let me share with you my age I don't know if that's personal but let me share it through my age so I've just turned 30 this summer and I'm someone who really is excited about well another bright spot I'm someone who's very excited about you know aging and growing I think it's something to be celebrated because you know it's it's great you made it another year but that being said I was thinking before making this video when I make this video what would I do different if I as a 30 year old was to break into Tech today what kind of tips would I take that would be helpful what kind of process would I follow and I want to share with you that today so for me one of the first things I would do if I was breaking into Tech today at 30 years of age I would definitely start networking and be strategic in who I'm networking with I would go on LinkedIn and this is what I do today even as someone who recently got into software development Advocate role and what I did is go on LinkedIn and just cold call meaning just reach out to people whose careers you admire because and what that will do is two things one it will show that you're taking initiative and you really want to get out there the other thing it will do is even if the person that you connect with might just be good for a coffee chat or some information they might know someone who you can connect with and why I think networking is even more important as you get into the tech industry at an older age than say 19 is because you're going to be networking oftentimes with people with your peers with people your age typically especially if you're going into leadership or asking people about leadership and you might not be starting in leadership but you know you want to connect with other leaders and this might not always be the case that they are older but most the time it will be and what this does is it puts you on their radar and it makes them aware of you it really shows initiative too if you are someone who's like hey I'm not in this industry but I want to get in it this is what I've done and this is where I'm going that is huge huge the other thing I would do aside from networking is be very strategic in the companies I am looking to get on board with I would be very strategic in that because if you are someone and this might not apply to everyone but if you are someone who's breaking to Tech at an older age and you don't want to work with just a bunch of 19 or 20 year olds which if you do that's great there's nothing wrong with that but if you are a bit older being strategic in the companies you look for seeing the members on their team because sometimes it's nice not to feel like a complete lone fish in the pond and have people surrounded by you who are similar in age maybe they are further along in their career but they can relate to more personable things with you another thing I think is absolutely key when you're breaking into Tech at an older age still kind of feeling unsure about yourself is to go to conferences and meetups and I know this kind of relates to networking but it's so important because once again you're getting out there you're showing initiative and I think why I keep harping on this networking thing is because you'll quickly realize as you start going to these things that there are a lot of people who did it just like you who started out later in life you know maybe they were in a completely different industry very successful found coding or found designing found product management whatever it is and thought this is where I need to be so you're definitely not alone and I think one of the best ways to really boost your confidence in not feeling alone is to surround yourself by people by doing that okay to wrap it up to sum up this conversation at the end of the day you are never too old to break into Tech now don't come at me with this well too can a 90 year old break into Tech sure if that's what they want to do and they want to work why not but I'm talking realistically if you are thinking of making a career step or switch use these tactics use these tips the biggest thing at the end of the day I think is to be your own biggest cheerleader meaning put yourself out there advocate for yourself know your self-worth and you have more experience than you realize doesn't mean it's easy it's going to be scary but you can definitely do it and I have so much admiration for people who do do that and I think a lot of employers will as well so stay focused keep on going and you will get there also if you haven't already hit that subscribe button for
