[Music] 4am already you want to study while working full-time while doing so many other things you gotta get up at like 3 30 a.m like me that's what all the hustlers are doing it let's try that again take two let's do a realistic how I study and learn new things while having a full-time job and also running a business and I really wanted to make that Meme or parody at the beginning because I see a lot of these videos and they're completely unrealistic and as someone who has a lot a lot on the go as I'm sure like many of you do but it's so imperative so crucial that I keep up my technical skills learn new things keep on building different things because it's relative to my day job but also my business and my interests how I want to advance my career you get the idea learning is very important but as we take on more responsibilities it seems to get pushed to the side in today's video I'm going to share with you how I manage to maintain studying and learning new things consistently with everything else going on okay let's go foreign first things first though as we uh go through my day we need to get some substance we need to get some food so let's create a smoothie and of course [Music] we have the Smoothie which probably made my mouth purple already and we have the coffee okay let's get really into this video though on how I managed to have a full-time job uh actually not just a full-time job but also to a very busy business through Tiffin Tech through making content for you uh working with different Partnerships educating you um I hope I'm educating you we're helping you and it's that alone those two things running a business and then also having a full-time job is a lot to manage so it's very important for me to keep up to date with all the tech Trends or keep on learning new things not just keep him to date with tech Trends but learning new things and the first thing that is the biggest thing my biggest piece of advice to you is to understand how how you best function throughout the day and what I mean by that is throughout the day there are different parts of our day where we have energy fluctuations so for me in the morning I am extraordinarily productive that is my time but as the day goes on so does my energy levels now some people more have graphs like this where it goes up and down throughout the day some people are night owls and work really well at night for me I know that I work best in the morning so much so that by 5 PM I pretty much shut everything down because I won't get anything done anyways or it'll take me a long time now with that information once you identify when you are most productive I always focus on my hardest or things I really want to do the least uh during my time of productivity and although learning isn't necessarily something I want to do the least it's one of the things that gets pushed off the fastest if I don't do it first thing because it's not a priority in the sense that direct learning isn't going to you know bring me more money or pay my paycheck I'm not going to get fired if I don't do it any of those things now long term speaking there is massive benefits in continuous learning so I understand the importance of it but that being said it's easy to push it off okay we are back in Action we have a coffee um it's too hot it's too hot going from smoothie to Coffee not good okay the other thing I want to talk about once you have figured and identified when you are most productive throughout the day and decide to make that your time to learn you need to actually make out a plan so I'll show you on screen here a little example calendar I guess you could call it that goes through how I plan out my learning so as you can see I don't learn every single day because it's not realistic based on everything else I have to do in my days but in the mornings I always allocate one to two hours for learning time not sorry not every morning but every second morning and I only do this throughout the work days the weekends I completely take off and this is because for me I find it best when I have one or two days usually it's one day on Sunday to completely recharge versus working a little bit in increments this is not something that's completely unrealistic to be learning every day or every second day whatever it is but you need to prioritize that and for me in order to prioritize something I have to have a reason why am I going to prioritize this why does this matter so for example for me right now at work I need to learn nexjs I don't need to but it's something that we use a lot at work and if I'm speaking to other developers and educating other developers about this about next.js I want to be able to be proficient in it I want to have built projects in it really understand it the fundamentals and so that gives me a purpose as to why I am learning this now this could also be probably allocated into some of my work time that being said I work at a startup so it's is as we say we're building as we're flying the plane like it's very very hectic so I choose to learn prior to starting my day and if you this might be a different case for you depending on why you are learning well with a full-time job but have a purpose as to why you are learning that isn't to say just learn something for fun but I do think it makes it easier and you will be more disciplined if you have a reason to your learning maybe it is to get a promotion maybe it's to get a new job but have that purpose write it down and I literally have it on my desk as to what I'm learning it's like a little commitment to yourself okay now another thing you really need to do when you're starting to study with a full-time job is you need to have a place to work and this doesn't have to be you know in like a dedicated office or this massive home office whatever it is but have a space that is just dedicated for studying and or working and what this does is it really tricks your mind or your body that during this time when you sit down in this specific area it's solely for working you're not going to you're not your body's not used to going on social media during this time looking at the computer or sorry TV but rather it's like okay this environment it is for Learning and that is a little trick a little psychological trick that will help set you up for Success when learning as well now let's talk a little bit about time blocking and also too a bit more about finding the time in a day to learn so as I mentioned I really prioritize my mornings for learning that being said there is other Alternatives that I've tried in the past that work pretty well too one of the things being is learning on your slow time so maybe it's your lunch time maybe it's right after lunch or maybe a breaks throughout the day now I have tried this breaking up my learning throughout the day into say 15 minute increments where it's like in the morning I'll learn for 15 minutes then I'll take a coffee break and learn and continues throughout the day for me this completely does not work I really need to sit down and be focused for a period of Time Versus just kind of blips of information now everyone's different so I definitely think it's worth trying out for you but from me it's something that I really need to get into the zone and focus maybe it's because I usually learn technical things that I need to spend more time on it than just a few minutes but I would say for me as I've shown you in my calendar it's usually between one to two hours I try for two because a lot of the courses I take or what I am reading is quite a few hours in length and I like to you know in the period of a month complete something that actually brings me to my next point which is what how do you decide what course to take or what material to utilize when you are learning something I think now we're entering an era which is really interesting it's getting to the point where there is so much information online on the internet that's not the problem the problem now is what resources to trust where do you find accurate information where do you trust these courses and that on its own is very challenging how I usually utilize this or navigate this is depends on what I am learning but for a lot of things I'll go back to my next JS example for that one I got some advice from people who who are very familiar with next and a lot of them were like Tiff don't even take a course or a tutorial just you know you're very familiar with react just read the documentation on next and you'll be fine and I started doing that and and that's not typically my normal learning pattern my normal learning pattern is watch a video read the documentation then build on my own and I found when I broke that learning pattern and tried what they were suggesting it completely did not work for me it really messed me up and I just felt confused and just like flustered I didn't know where things were going and anyways it just what that really taught me was that whatever way works best for you for learning whether it be through Visual through reading the documentation through building through all the above make sure you stick with that and if you don't know how you learn best that's something that you need to try over time try different methods whether it be reading the documentation video format Etc not only try different formats but kind of as I alluded to try them in different uh orders so for me having the video first watching tutorial first really helps me and when I started then when I flipped the script and went back to learning xjs through learning through video first and then documentation's like oh this is my sense okay we got it here the other thing that is super important to note is to have realistic expectations I think a lot of times the problems that I spoke about a lot in these videos is that people get so worried about or so they put so much pressure on themselves to I need to learn this by this day and yes you should have an end date in mind or an end goal in mind but be kind to yourself because life happens you know you're working a full-time job maybe like my case you're also running a business on the side and you have a family or personal life like I think sometimes we put this unrealistic pressure on ourselves and if we don't deliver and reach that pressure or meet those potentials that we're trying to anyways it just in turn we don't do anything we freeze or we give up so one of my biggest things that my biggest takeaways I guess for me from this past year is really to be kind to myself speak to myself how I would speak to others and if you've been watching my videos for a while I'm sure you have heard me say this but it's really because it is so important to do so when you start treating yourself like you treat others and giving yourself the space that hey maybe there's a day you just don't feel like it that's okay so those are really my biggest tips and pieces of advice for anyone who really wants to study with a full-time job it's not easy but you need to be consistent and you need to think big picture long term how this will help you what you are doing the purpose of it what is the purpose of your learning and how it will help you in the future I've actually heard of some people who carry around or put on their dad ask a little photo of themselves as a child this is something that's interesting to me all right I just got cut off I think that means Tiff it's time to wrap it up I hope you found this video very helpful and valuable though as far as how you can study with a full-time job when you are learning something new take these tips into consideration the biggest thing for me the biggest takeaway though is really to not only prioritize it but also to have a purpose have an understanding as to why you are learning speaking of learning I'm gonna go do just that bye everyone oh and if you haven't hit that subscribe button and leave in the comments questions you have because a I will literally go through all these comments and answer each and every one of them you can hold me to that and the second thing is that's how I make these videos so let me know what other topics you want me to cover bye everyone [Music] hold on [Music]
