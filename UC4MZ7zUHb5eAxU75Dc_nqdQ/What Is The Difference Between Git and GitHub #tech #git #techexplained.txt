ever wonder what the difference is between git and GitHub or at least how to explain it listen up git is installed and maintained on your local system rather than in the cloud it is focused on Version Control and co-chairing there are no user management tools okay now GitHub GitHub is a hosting service for git repositories and it's cloud-based and of course why we love GitHub is you can share your code with others giving them the power to make edits and revisions
