how are chat applications like Facebook Messenger Discord or Whatsapp designs like what actually goes on behind the scenes okay here's how I would explain it to someone who might not understand it at a high level let's use my dogs in this example Harry and Mr mugs when Harry sent a message to Mr mugs it's first sent to chat service a let's call it then the message goes through a sequencing service which gives it a unique ID and saves it in the message store next it's sent in the message thank you to make sure it reaches Mr Mug's chat service if Mr mugs the receiver is already online the message is sent directly to his chat service service beat but if Mr mugs is offline the message is sent to a push server and sent to its device through a notification once the message reaches Mr mugs whether he's online or not it is pushed to him via a websocket for a real-time chatting experience
