okay you know one of the things that I am terrible at probably makes me a horrible person I always forget to send happy birthday text messages to my friends I love my friends you know and I mean well even if I write in Google Calendar it's something that my mind my brain doesn't have space for for whatever reason so naturally like we do with everything in our lives I'm like why do I not have this automated why do I not have a python script running that will check yearly to see when it's January 29th or when it's February 15th whatever the day is for my friend's birthdays and send out happy birthday text message so of course I got to work and did just this I'm using chat GPT really enabling or trying out to use chat GPT to build this for me I mean we're talking about automation here let's see how much we can automate with our code now there are a lot of alternatives to chat GPT I'm not saying it's the best one to use out there I'll list some down here but because it's so hyped up right now and everyone's talking to them like I gotta use chat GPT for this so in this video we are going to be building a python script that will run creating a job that will run and check for a certain date you can put whatever date you want in there a specific time and then we're also going to be using twilio I love twilio it's so much fun to automate the process of sending out text messages and in this case sending out happy birthday but we can really alter this code for whatever reason you want all right let's get into it oh if you haven't already hit that subscribe button I love making these videos for you around Tech coding career leave in the comments other questions you have what topics you want me to cover I answer every single one of your comments if you want to put me to the test leave down below and I'll make sure to answer okay let's get into it [Music] okay you can see here I have chat GPT chat GPT why is it so hard to say open and let's just get right into it so the more specific of course you can be the better and this is something where I think there's always that argument of our programmers going to be replaced no we're going to be working on more difficult and complex tasks and thanks to chat GPT or other AIS we can actually use them as assistants to do some of the simple things and in this case let's tell it to write a script for us in Python to send text messages to our friends on their birthday and whatever the date is obviously I'm going to choose today's date because I want to see the results today just test out so let's get into it right a python script we're gonna have to sign up for twilio but let's just do this first write a python script for me to that sends out a happy birthday text message to my friend every year on January 29th using twilio let's see what happens I actually have never typed this in before so let's see what happens all right let's speed this up one thing I really like though about chat GPT is it does provide you comments as to what it's doing and the whys it's doing it so uh you know this is where you're gonna put this this is where you're going to put your ID it gets very specific which is really nice all right so as expected we need to set up a twilio account let's go ahead and do that and it also didn't create a job for us so you can see here you can schedule the script to run using a task scheduler which we will get it to create a job for us as well but let's first do twilio and go here to twilio and create a free account I forget if I have one I think I have one give me a sec here if you already have one login if you don't create one okay so I got my twilio account set up which I'm not going to share with you at this time but just make sure you are logged into a twilio account and also to create a new project with BS code create a new file in that project I just did main.pi now first things first let's get our python virtual environment setup I always forget this I don't know why I think because I'm a JavaScript person at heart so let me scroll here and I have Visual Studio code I'll link these docs down below because they're so helpful no matter what stage you're at with python and you can actually just go to well I'll just link it down below but basically it shares to you how to create a virtual environment in the terminal so I'm on Mac so I can just simply copy this and this is obviously assuming you follow the steps prior so you have python installed on your computer now let's go back to there and there we go perfect the back what's next and I think we can just start installing after this installing projects that's why we need to create a virtual environment is I need to be able to install some of these packages that chat GPT was telling us to install so if I go back to chat GPT let's copy this code here and as it's telling us we need to replace account Sid and auth token and then also to schedule a script to run so I'm going to get this code working first to test out and then I'm going to come back to chat GPT and give it more commands to create a job for us so it will run yearly okay let's go I don't know why I get so excited about the stuff that I do okay let's go back into vs code [Music] paste and we need to do Sid and your off token so let's go to your twilio I'm using my test credentials here and then enter in the recipient's phone number for me I'm going to enter in my phone number just to test it out kind of thing and then from this is just twilio's phone number okay so first things first let's see what happens when we run this actually we've got to install these packages here [Music] so let's go back to vs code and do this we want date time to be installed perfect and we also want I believe it was client to be installed let's go back to here perfect client or sorry that wasn't fine it was import client from twilio rest oopsies foreign I think we're good all right so what happens if we run this let's just test it out no module named twilio while it's installed twilio [Music] now I must type something in wrong there we go now what happens if we run this mm-hmm maybe it's because I was using the test account okay hold on a sec here okay you know I didn't do I didn't update the uh from number twilio phone number so make sure you update it to whatever twilio phone number they are giving you so I just did that there let's go ahead and run this you hear people walking above me it's it's kind of getting loud in here we got this we're doing this run python file in terminal and you can see here that's what it says and I actually get the message for it on my phone so let's pull up my phone here okay I've been trying to do it a little bit before I showed you well you can see here maybe I'll you know what I'm gonna send I will insert an image actually so you can't see how bright it is but basically it said happy birthday sent from your twilio trial account so obviously if you pay this Cent from your twilio trial account will be gone but it's so cool how you can automate all of these things like this is so useful for anyone who genuinely forgets to send happy birthday messages okay so we got it working to this point but obviously the next point is we need this to be a job that runs yearly so let's go back to chat DPT here and let's go copy this code again and go using write a job for this code that [Music] continue to run to check if it is January that will let you know what let's take their writing that can every year write a job for this code that will that will schedule the scripts around okay let's see what they say you know what I'm going to do instead I know what's going to do it's going to write yeah I don't really want to do that so here's what we're going to do let's search up python job scheduler let's see what it says here some ways to X scheduled jobs and python okay API scheduler I think that's like what I've used before which is really good I'm going to use contacts okay let's try doing the first one API scheduler okay let's go back to here write it use API scheduler for this code to schedule the text message to go out every year on January 29th okay I'm just gonna copy the code again see what it says okay while it's writing that I wanted to highlight here this is just something really fun to do and you can really think though of the different use cases that you can use chat gbt for from writing code from scratch like we are doing to then debugging it like we are doing uh we can also use it for documentation to comment on what the code is doing the use cases for it are really infinite in the sense of you can use it to whatever way suits you the best and I really like that we're doing this project because I feel like we're showing many different ways to be productive in your code and how to utilize this tools the best of its ability it's not going anywhere it's here to stay why not rather than fighting it and pushing this tool away embrace it and just make your coding experience even better by having some fun with it okay or writing it out still I'm going to speed this up and it also does a great job too of explaining like honestly chat GPT does a better job of explaining the answer it's giving than a lot of resources and stack Overflow to be honest with you Justin okay so we can see here our code's definitely been updated a bit uh to scheduler add jobs and message month one day 29. I've used this API for other python jobs and it's just like chef's kiss it works so easy it's so easy to use and it just takes all the stress away for you I find hours zero minute zero no we gotta run this the right time but first we gotta uh install background scheduler let's go back in here [Music] this is building together in real time no one's perfect or I'm not anyways if you are good for you congratulations must be boring okay so let's update this code now also it's kind of a pain in the butt because we need to transfer over our account Sid token and auth token but that's okay and also make sure to update your twilio phone number and uh recipient's number recipient's number put in your own to start with okay I'm going to paste it down here actually because then I'm going to transfer over my ID and token which I'm not going to show you so give me a minute will you do that as well okay there's one other thing we need to do before we run this job I want it to run I want to test it out now and right now for my time it is 125 do this for whatever time it is for you like minute in advance so let's go to wait where is the message I'm sending I don't want to send that I want a message.body first of all I want to say happy birthday then let's go back to chatgpt and say schedule the above code to run at 1 27 PM January 29th see if I'm giving myself enough time obviously you just changed the hour in a minute I'm assuming it's like 13 29. see could it just look at the documentation but we're already in chat GPT [Music] hour 13 minute so whatever it is for you if it's 2 p.m then do hour as 14 Etc and then same with minute okay let's go back in the code let's do hour 13 and then the minute I'm going to do 28 just because it's already 27. now let's go run python file in terminal hmm what are we going here [Music] the localized method is no longer necessary let's see go to here the above code is giving me this error solve it [Music] now let's see are we using the localized method I didn't think we were we are not so to fix the warning can remove the localized method but we didn't use it did we I'm looking here okay this isn't very smart because it's giving us the same freaking code okay we got it to run this is amazing actually you know what let me show you on screen here see it okay it's pretty bright let me add an image here of a screenshot this is a really fun project to do a really simple project to do I'll share the code down below essentially why it wasn't running is because we didn't have time zone uh part of the code so I asked chat gbt why is this code not running out in the time zone it did that very quickly and there we go this is just the what's going on with the hair here this is just the power of chat GPT though we use this for so many things as I mentioned from debugging creating the code documenting and understanding the comments for it to automating our life I mean who doesn't want to send out happy birthday message not even think about it it's so stressful I always forget people's birthdays I'm like I feel so bad so this is a huge a huge relief to me anyways make sure to give this video a thumbs up I hope you enjoyed going along with it let me know what other crazy things I should automate with my life with python with our lives and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button and I'll see you all soon thanks everyone on [Music]
