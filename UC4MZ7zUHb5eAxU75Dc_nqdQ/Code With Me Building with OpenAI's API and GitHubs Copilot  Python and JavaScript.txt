I look like a highlighter like a bright orange highlighter hey friends today we are going to be building with some trending technology one being open AIS API a lot of AI and apis I've been tinkering around with their API it is so fascinating what you can build in such a quick amount of time so simple and straightforward we also are going to be using GitHub co-pilot today I just paid for it paid for the subscription just for you so we are going to be using that as well all right let's get into it also if you can hear in the background it is like diamond ring out there is a ton of rain so if you hear any weird noise that's what that's what it is let's get to it [Music] all right I feel like I'm going to keep you here for this video it's a little different than usual I'm recording this screen this one will stay the same if you're wondering why is it not changing but it is in the video and right now as you can see I have up here open ai's home page introducing chat GPT yeah thanks we've heard of it before and also to whisper apis so I what I did and where I want to start with is let's go through the documentation now you might be thinking Tiff that's not that exciting but honestly it's pretty incredible and I feel like the best place to start when using any new piece of technology is honestly following the dots I know as developers or as Builders we often think ah the dogs are so boring let's just get into it but it usually is the right place to go so in the documentation here let's go into quick start this is always a good one to go to so as we can see here um let's scroll down openai has trained language models that are very good at understanding and generating text so their API provides access to these models and can be used to virtually solve any task that involves processing language so this we are going to build a simple application so let's scroll down to an example so if you see here introduction prompt write a tagline for an ice cream shop and it will complete with different prompts so it's pretty cool that you are able to interact with their language models once you have the basics down you can build like your own mini chat GPT essentially or whatever you want to build so let's scroll down here and let's get into where are we going here build your application let's use node for this and let's start by cloning the repository copy pull up a terminal that's what happens when I have too many things open I was playing uh snake let's just terminate that I did that the painful way that's okay all right so as you can see my terminal is here I'll try and zoom in just so you can see the terminal more clearly and let's see let's decide where are we let's go to our desktop always dangerous putting stuff in our desktop and do git clone all right and then we can see here navigate into the project record directory and make a copy of the example environment variables file all right perfect so let's open up our vs code because that is where we'll be going to do all right I think what I'm going to do is put this as half can I make this half and half come on student instructions is half and the other part of the screen will be vs code I think that makes sense right all right so then if we see here what are they saying they are saying to add our API key so let's go into oh yeah we have environment here and let's just change this to EnV we can take out the example now from here we're going to need to find our open API key and you can see here I have a few secret keys that I've made in the past I'm going to go ahead and create a new secret key which is secret all right now when you have your secret key in your environment file let's carry on so wait let's start by running all or installing all of our dependencies so let's open up a new terminal make sure you're in your project and go npm install perfect now npm run Dev and let's see what we get this should open up Logan localhost 3000 okay name my pet so enter an animal let's name as it says here let's name a dog generate names oh do I have to I think I have to pay okay we're back we have input our credit card which is always dangerous because sometimes it goes too much but I really wanted to build with this and show you the power of it if you haven't tinkered around with it already so let's go ahead and enter dog generate names Super Spot Mighty mutt the amazing Rover Mighty mutt but isn't that so cool so if we go back to the tutorial let's look at exactly what we did and they go through understanding the code so you can see here if we go into generate JS let's go and generate close this and they're going through this code now so you can see here please enter a valid animal uh where is it generate prompt specifically so suggest three names for an animal that is a superhero animal and then we have cat dog and then uh capitalization and we'll come up with other ones so what else do they say here do another prompt so this is pretty cool you can see here already with this prompt you could change it to say cow or whatever animal you want and it will interact with your users let's do try this translate natural language to SQL queries right okay so we are in node I wonder if we can do it directly and here still hmm this is all about the animal configuration we have here let's just try it copy and let's go here open AI configuration so let's take everything from here down delete take these out because we already have them right prompt postgres SQL tables with our properties employee employee ID name Department give me a second idea all right okay we're back to the name My Pet Project the SQL one was giving me a really hard time so what I did when I was looking into it is something's going on with our API right now there's so many people using their API and working with it that at sometimes it's very slow or down it's just not it's not perfect so let's stick with this example and one thing I wanted to really dive into is let's talk about how to use copilot so I have copilot installed you can see here on in my vs code it's right down in the corner but you can see copilot is there and there's a ton of different things you can do with copilot whether it be to write a function so for example if I wanted to say um this is for a path you could say right a function that generates prompt and then you need to have the function kind of written out to start with so say generate prompt and then tab and then it would continue so that is one way okay interjection in this video here this is in the future Tiff in the future and I have on screen here some code I got the code to work I realized what I was doing wrong and honestly this is what happens when you are genuinely learning and building in public so you can see here I have Rebel pulled up I switched from vs code so I'll share as well my Chris microphone I'll share as well the rebel so you can play along with it but essentially what was happening why it wasn't running is I was not giving it a specific prompt so you can see here I'm using the text DaVinci model engine and similar to the examples in openai there is the prompt we are giving it the max tokens you want to use different things like that so down here in response we're calling this function get response and this one was an example that they gave for give me the text or the color based on a mood I am feeling or anything like that so let's go ahead and run this and this should return a hex code here there we go perfect and this returns a really nice blue color by the way and you can do anything here so right let's try this I don't know if this one will work I don't know if this exact prompt but let's try write a SQL query for me that [Music] um yeah sure we'll return a list all the users the ghost The Ghost Writer is working for me let's see this might not work I don't know yeah so this is a very simple example but now you can use it essentially for turning text into SQL to get different uh color scheme different hex codes that you want anything you want really the whole thing is you can prompt anything in here and it will return the response so this is super cool right above this one here get response I am passing in my API key I should put it in its own environment folder but I'll share this link to this Ripple down below so you can play around with it too once again you'll need an openai API key that is free you just might hit your number of uh tokens that you can use for free so that's just a side note anyways just want to share we got it working okay let's dive into using GitHub co-pilot honestly from being totally honest I don't think I've used it enough to really appreciate it because thus far I've been using uh Genie a lot which I was having some troubles with uh because my API key expired on it but I really like it it uses chat or it uses GPT 3 I believe and it's just more user friendly I think it's because I've been having some issues getting GitHub co-pilot to show up in my vs code in this panel here but you can see down here it is installed we have it right down here no I do not want to disable I am paying for it 10.99 a month I think which is kind of crazy but I just wanted to try it out so one thing you can do is you can write comments and it will help suggest code for you so let's do that in the use case of we have say we didn't have this API key or we wanted to put some constraints around it so let's do uh check if API is configured else give an error okay so then it's not going to necessarily just write out code for you right out the gate you still need to be able to code of course so let's do if configuration API key and I just tab here enter and then I kind of just go along through the prompt it's giving me which is pretty cool so we have if there is no configuration API key then please follow instructions else and it will kind of give some hints as well there you go so it is helpful um I think there are so much to uncover still with copilot that I need to do because so far I've been as I mentioned I've been using this one here Genie I like their UI specifically how you can add tests find problems optimize explain it's super user friendly I need to update my API key for it actually though uh which I'm not going to do in this video but anyways it's I think GitHub copilot is the way to go especially for professional developers when you are going to be coding as you are but then want some extra kind of help I also been using Rebels Ghostwriter which is exactly the same as as GitHub co-pilot it is I think about ten dollars a month as well so you do have to pay for it and it's one of those things that the more you use these tools the better you will get and it really honestly is not going to take over developers jobs or anything like that but more so it's going to help you build faster and more efficiently and I think it's a good way to almost think of as a coding assistant or oh what is it you're learning with it meaning if there's something you don't know you can ask it to explain the code to you or different things like that so it is pretty cool I'm not blown away compared to Genie or anything because I I don't know I just I felt Genie was really good but I think it's because I need to spend some more time with co-pilot alright everyone I hope you enjoyed going through that walkthrough with me it is amazing the power that you are going to be able to really harness with these apis and what you can build all right I'll see you all soon make sure to hit that subscribe button for more building sessions together for more uh career advice and insights personal life you know the whole you know my stomach's rambling I gotta go eat bye everyone [Music] oh
