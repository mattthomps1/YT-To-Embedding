AI is going to take over all of our jobs so why even bother have you had this thought recently no just me okay okay I guess we'll just be me moving to Costa Rica then and living and surfing all day and okay I've thought about this dream a little too much until that point comes we still need to get jobs and although AI is not necessarily smarter than humans I do think it is more efficient I'm going to share with you today the top websites that you have probably never heard of that will not only help you with your job search but also in landing that job before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career related content and all right let's just dive into it foreign list is called Google interview warm-up and I'll link all these down below by the way this is such a cool tool especially if you're interviewing or preparing to interview for Fang like companies Fang mang whatever we're calling it today and I'll put it up on screen here as you can see it's interview warm-up and you can actually click on start practicing and then choose the field that you want to start practicing in so data analytics e-commerce project management Etc from there it will actually take you to a series of interview questions in which you will be able to use your microphone and practice your response this is a really interesting way to I think a lot of times what am I trying to say here a lot of times we especially in a technical role we focus on technical questions but we forget how important it is to also practice our soft skill questions and this tool by Google is a great way to really practice out loud especially now that a lot of interviews are done remotely practice speaking to a computer which is strange at first when you're doing an interview next on the list is called resume boarded and this is something that I feel okay I'm not going to say because I feel like I'm going to say it then for every single tool but I wish I had when I was job hunting because it would have saved me a lot of time and what this essentially does is it was designed by top recruiters that built an AI powered platform and it gives you instant feedback on your resume so it will give you scores based on different areas of your resume for example if you included a summary at the top or different bullet points throughout your your resume and what it will do is it will rank that out of 10. so how did you do on this part what could be rewarded how could this be reformatted and based on trending topics and keywords that you are looking for while job hunting and this is really interesting I will put up on screen here they have some examples actually and it's really like the science and psychology behind this is something that I've never even really thought about such as some what are some weak action verbs that you included how could you sound stronger how could you sound X Y and Z meaning whatever kind of your the tone you're trying to set these are things I never thought of this is so interesting and yes they'll go through your resume sift through it and highlight different uh verbs that you could use different if you're repeating yourself spelling errors if there's inconsistency this one is game changer I told you I'm gonna say it for all of them this tool is really cool and something I wish I knew about earlier now this tool before we even get into it it's called Loop CV and you do have to be careful with this because what it essentially does is you upload your CV select a job type you want and press start then Loop will really do the rest meaning it will mass apply on your behalf every single day so there's pros and cons to this the con is what the pro is which is it's Mass applying the con on this side though is that you could be it could be applying to jobs that you really want for you and for those jobs you might want to tailor specifically your resume and CV so that's the downside the major downside the upside is if you're in a position where you've been applying for quite a while and you're just not getting anything you're tired this is a great tool to help you just like blast out your resume and CV so I'll share it on screen here let me just record my screen the first thing you can do is put in the job title job location and for me I like to search just for remote jobs I like the comfort of my home and uh then put in your CV or resume now if we go next how you want to present yourself so for example present yourself Tiffany interested to learn more I'd probably change this but let's just leave this as is for now okay so you can see how it works save Harry Mr mugs actually don't include my email one second here save and then just cut this part out if I don't want to put anyone next and then it goes into do you want to exclude some companies keywords that should be present so we can get pretty specific which is really interesting uh that you can do it quite a bit automatically send emails automatically fill form applications like this will do the heavy lifting for you so it's pretty cool depending on your situation but as I said before there are some pros and cons for this one you need to be careful for talk to books by Google this is something I've been playing around with for a while and it's really great because whether you are focusing on technology computer science whatever it is you can talk to them so as I have up on screen here you can see talked books by Google it's basically a non-traditional search meaning you can say something really interesting like show me books based on the scent Rose or whatever it is if you scroll down a little bit to some examples there's one what is fun about computer programming so if you click on it it will give you a list of books that are related to this topic and this is really interesting because you can get very specific like for example what smell brings back great memories that's so interesting and I thought this would be really good to include in this list because you could really tone you could really structure it to categorize or get books back for you that are really whatever you are focusing on interviewing so if you are focusing on a technical interview if you are focusing on product management interview whatever it is this is a great place to search for specific books and it's really fun I just felt like I had to include it the fifth one on the list is word tune if you haven't used word tune already you are missing out not only is this a great tool for when you are applying to jobs and writing emails but this is a great tool that honestly for me I use all the time I'll pull it up on screen here again and essentially though word tuned a lot of these tools unfortunately have free versions but aren't necessarily free so it depends on what you're looking for if you're looking to use a tool temporarily or long term but let me show you right now on screen word tune I'm getting I'm not going to log into my account so as you can see here I have on screen just a blank and open document and what I'm going to do is type what I would type in an email so I could be doing this in Gmail too as an example but hi there I would like to set up with you an initial initial call please let me know when you are available okay and then if we go here where it says word tune it will rewrite for you and you can see the different options that it gives you this is great if you are like me and do not enjoy to write and it just lets you be able to kind of throw your ideas on the page and it will structure and reformat it for you in a way that is best written so word tune you uh make me sound smarter than I am next on the list is job scan this okay no I'm not gonna say it but it's really cool I have it up on screen here let me show you how it works so I've already uploaded my resume to job scan and next what you need to do is paste a job description or let's in this case use a sample job description and what it will do is it will tailor your resume based on this job description so it's kind of working backwards rather than you you know modifying a job a resume and then submitting it to a job it's actually taking that job description and then modifying your resume to it because as we all know a lot of times our resume when we send it out it doesn't hit a human first it's actually going to the first person no first thing I don't know what you would call that it's not a human that sees it first oftentimes it's another AI or a bot and it's just looking for keywords so this is a great tool to make sure that you get through that stage let's choose front-end developer so you can see here this is just an example of a job description we go to scan [Music] and you can see here match rate is very low the the resume I uploaded was for a developer relations position so very different than front-end developer so even if you look at C hard score in hard skills it's like resume doesn't have any of these job descriptions have X like not quite a few of them soft skills even that's nothing once again this resume was not tailored for a front-end developer but you can see how handy this would be if I was looking for a front-end developer position being able to feel like oh okay I see I need to you know use a few of these keywords I see that I need to use a few of these hard skills and put them in there and it can get really it will help you be able to get really specific especially when you're applying for these jobs at larger companies like Google like Amazon where even smaller companies where the first step first stage is that your resume is just going to be scanned by another AI this will really help you very very interesting of course as you can see there's a lot that you need to either fully sign up for and then pay for of course but once again if you are job hunting you know the power of these tools and how much they can help you even if you have to pay temporarily okay those are some of the top tools I would use when job hunting again getting AI to help me is the key the end of the day let's not try and fight AI but rather you know what it's there let's use it to our best of our abilities but it's very important to note also at the same time not solely rely on AI especially for some of these tools that I have listed yes they are very helpful but it's equally if not more important to do your due diligence to make sure you are adding that human touch you don't want to just automate everything and not stand out in the crowd because you are using AI for everything so that's really important to note as well once again I linked these all down below none of these are sponsored I'm just really obsessed with AI recently and I know it's been trending a lot GPT in the news and I didn't actually include GPT but I could have okay I'm gonna wrap it up there I hope you found this very helpful and useful though not only for your job search but a lot of these tools can be used in your day-to-day especially word tune for example and if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button
