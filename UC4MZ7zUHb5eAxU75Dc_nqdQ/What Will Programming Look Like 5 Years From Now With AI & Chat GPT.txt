AI has made a huge impact on programming over the span of under a year think back to November with chat GPT how this changed the way that programmers learn how to code it completely revolutionized how we think about code the way we code in such a short amount of time and it can't help but bring up the question well if this is all in under a year what does the future hold in five years for programming with AI will there be programmers even around is there a point in me still learning how to code and today we're going to be covering just that what will AI programming look like in five years this is something I spent a ton of time doing research on on the plan so I'm going to share with you in this video not only predictions but also back them up by some interesting facts and data points and so you can have an understanding of is it worth learning how to code and if you are learning how to code where should you start from should you still start from the basics what will this mean in the future will it still be a good job or will it be a very ordinary job this is all really exciting to me and that's why I'm filming it while I'm in the middle of paradise let let's get into it [Music] actually as a side note because I learned how to code about seven eight years ago been coding professionally for six years now I look back at what I started and I feel like Grandma insert like wig here of of gray hair because I go back in my day we didn't have ai to code with we had a code from scratch we used stack Overflow now it's the reality is you don't even have to use stack Overflow typically nowadays AI is being trained with stack Overflow so you can use different AI tools to give you the exact answer you're looking for immediately it's wild it's Bonkers I feel like I'm one of those really old individuals who sometimes are stereotyped by being like we did it the hard way you don't know what it was like for us back then I'm one of them I'm one of them all right let's dive into it okay I don't know about you but I have spent hours not even just hours days like my entire work days just debugging it might be for a feature I'm working on or a different task that I need to complete and I get stuck on about the amount of time that it used to take to solve these bugs that would come up or for example if you needed help from a more senior engineer reaching out to them when they are available they need to clear their schedule like there's this huge trickle effect and impact on what that looks like however now with AI and if you look ahead even five years from now with AI it is going to be doing all the mundane tasks for us I mean it already is and it's going to continue to be able to build at a larger scale so okay Tiff that sounds terrible like where are we going to be needed the reality is we are going to be needed to think bigger picture which is really exciting to have more opportunity to be more in a leadership position programmers will really become thought leaders in the sense of we have to understand the code and what its capabilities are even if we aren't the ones writing or solving these little small bugs but understanding the possibilities the capabilities of it and being able to speak about it those skills are huge huge and yes we still will be writing code but it won't be those mundane tasks and what that will allow us to do is free up our time to think bigger picture I predict in the next five years we will see so many more programmers become founders of companies become CEOs or ctOS of companies well they already do go that path but we'll really see the spike in programmers becoming thought leaders because we aren't spending our time day on and day day in day in and day out working on mundane tasks but rather we can think bigger picture which to me is pretty exciting okay let's do an example of this so when you think big picture or when you think that these programmers become thought leaders and I'm not saying we aren't already please don't take does that but I'm just saying I think we'll see more going in that direction imagine if you can well we already can I mean I was playing around with whisper API yesterday from openai and imagine you can train AI systems to develop more Innovative programs and at a quicker rate than that that allows you to continue to build and iterate and fail see what works and what doesn't work at such a quicker rate and programmers will be really at the heart of that okay this is a really cool spot by the way look at this a little reading Nook here tip number two or Point number two of what the future will look like for programmers what happens when you are not spending your time debugging or working on these smaller tasks what it allows you to do is be able to upskill when you look at the job market there's three main areas that really stand out to me right now that will continue to grow in demand especially in the next five years the first one being cyber security as everything continues to go digital and more businesses are going online the need for cyber Security Experts whether it's Engineers whether it's analysts business people cyber security as a whole is continuing to grow at such a quick rate and I don't know about you but when I'm programming or was programming every single day day in and day out working on these mundane tasks it didn't leave a lot of time for me to upskill I was burnt out by the end of the day I was tired I loved my job but it's tiring even now as a developer relations I I feel like after the end of the day I'm tired I don't want to spend my time learning something new after 5 PM or waking up extra early to do that so now being able to pass on these mundane tassies smaller tasks to AI what it allows us to do is actually become smarter by upskilling leveling up our skills choosing what area interests us that maybe we thought wasn't even possible because of the lack of time which I get super excited about as you can tell cyber security being one I'll put some stats up here on screen around it it's just mind-blowing though how the need the demand for cyber security is continuing to rise also as a side note it's very early in the morning and I'm on I'm on my first cup of coffee so just bear with me okay they haven't programmed AI to inject coffee into me yet but they will suit and I'm sure the other two industries though that are as well very popular and when I was researching are continuing to go in demand of course artificial intelligence is one and I'll put some stats here around it it's continuing to Skyrocket and and will continue in the next five years as more things become automated and start grasping onto Ai and machine learning and the capabilities continue to Skyrocket and the last one being cloud computing cloud computing really start to Skyrocket during the pandemic and as companies are really going online for the first time looking for other Solutions that's when you really see the spike I mean it was already trending this way but then I noticed during 2020 it was like and it's continuing to Skyrocket the mount companies are investing in it I'll once again put some stats here on screen and it's just continuing to go up and I think cloud computing is something that's so interesting so much opportunity for and another great area and now you can actually think about studying or or learning these things online because you're freeing up more time so kind of tying to number one I would say programmers not only are going to become thought leaders but also intellectuals and a lot more of the theory and architecture side of things will continue to grow as well the last thing that is so important to note is it's not going to happen overnight we really did see this boom of AI come along when chat GPT was released in November of last year and since then it's the thing everyone is talking about but the reality is it still has a long way to go it's growing at a much quicker pace and it will continue to as it gets smarter and smarter but it's not going to be instant and I always get this question well Tiff is it still worth learning the basics the fundamentals of programming absolutely just like anything you need to build a foundation and if you are someone who is learning to code or already did learn to code it is not a waste of time it is one of the best things you can invest in yourself it's kind of like a sales but do this it's one of the best things you could do but it's because I'm so passionate about it because it changed my life and I see the impact it has on others lives it doesn't mean you necessarily need to become a full-time programmer for example or whatever but understanding how Tech is built is so powerful as it is literally changing and building our world and what better way to be part of that than understand to some degree at least how it is built and you can do that with code so yes if you are thinking of learning to code I would highly suggest still doing so you need those foundations and then from there you'll continue to grow you'll use AI tools along the way and that's totally okay that's actually great you should embrace and adopt them as well and on that note because AI is going to have such a rapid change or rapid pace for how we code and how we program not only should you keep up with AI tools I think it will become something that you need to almost like when you are learning to code you learn how to install vs code for some people or or you learned how to use the terminal now I think it will become you also learn how to use different AI tools not saying will necessarily be chat GPT but some AI tool that you use for programming assistance they're like your assistance you can think of at the end of the day AI is actually set to create 7.2 million new jobs thanks to its help with productivity freeing up people's time the possibilities are endless and sitting here and making this video I couldn't help but think the things that we there are going to be so many new jobs in the next five years that we literally don't know about yet because they don't exist and that's really exciting so I think the best thing that we can do as technologists is continue to upskill and not be fearful of is this going to take my job but rather thinking of it how can this help me be a better person build better technology for people help others and from there I think we're really secure maybe I'll look back on this video and be like well no one's secure and that's okay but I'd rather be on the optimistic side can continuing to build and learn and grow with AI versus The Other Side what about you thanks everyone I hope you enjoyed this video make sure to hit
