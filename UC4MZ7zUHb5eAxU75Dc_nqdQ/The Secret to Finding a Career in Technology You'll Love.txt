when you are learning something new you spend 
a lot of time investing in that skill whether   it be coding marketing a soft skill whatever case 
may be and as you're investing more and more time   into this skill to either get a new job growing 
your career there's always this worry in our   heads of am I doing the right thing am I going 
to regret it what if I don't even like this in   a few years or a few months from now and this 
is a constant worry that I know so many of us   have had around am I choosing the right career 
how do I find a career that I really love I'm   going to share with you today how I was able to 
discover and find a career that I really love as   someone who's been there firsthand coming from 
the fashion industry and doing complete 180 into   Tech and even in technology growing in different 
roles I'm going to share with you some tips and   insight that I've really learned and how to hone 
in and find my dream career before we get started   though make sure to hit that subscribe button 
for more Tech and coding related content leave   in the comments any questions you have or I'm 
curious to hear even have you found your dream   career are you still working towards 
it all right let's get into it [Music]   I see some of these kind of topics covered and one 
thing that a lot of people say is you know we're   not a lot but some people say is detach yourself 
from your career it doesn't matter you don't need   to love your career it's just a source of income 
but we spend more time in our career in our nine   to five than we do with our families with our 
friends it's probably throughout a large part   of our life the where we spend the majority of our 
time and it's essential in my opinion to actually   enjoy what you do if you don't you're going to 
be miserable you're going to test going into work   every day and if you think that you can completely 
turn that off after 5 PM you can't the energy that   you have through the day and how you feel about 
your work will continue to flow outside of work   that's why it's so important to find a career 
that you actually really enjoy maybe even love   that's up to you to decide as we continue to get 
older time becomes more precious and with the the   time being more of a value you we don't want to 
spend time in places that we are uncertain will   bring us a return or that we will really enjoy 
going back to the coding analogy here if you are   learning how to code and you're hitting some Road 
bumps you might be like is this really for me is   this something I really see myself sticking with 
long term what what if it's just something that's   temporary or it's a fad how do I know there 
are a few ways I can really help you uncover   if you're on the right track to get Landing 
your dream career and how to uncover what areas   to really spend your time focusing in for me one 
of the biggest ways was actually utilizing other   people so whether this be friends uh different 
connections and hearing about their experiences   now everyone's experience is completely unique and 
you can't base your decisions on someone else's   experience but if there is a trend after speaking 
to a few people in a certain industry for example   the tech industry and you're like this sounds 
really something I would like you know there   are cons but the pros definitely are stronger and 
something I'm gravitating towards is a good way   to get a sense of how other people feel about the 
industry that you're considering getting into or   more specifically the job or career path and for 
me this did a really good job of understanding you   go online and you see all of these pros and these 
highlights of the different career paths and it   seems all great but when you actually speak to 
someone who's gone through that process and gone   through that career you not only get the pros and 
the positives but you also get the negatives which   I think is almost more important in the situation 
that you are looking to land or grow into your   dream career because then you know what you're 
really in for yes you know the positives but here   are the negatives and are the negatives are you 
okay with those negatives or is it too much for   you another way that really helped me discover 
my dream career is to try different things where   most of my curiosity lied was around coding but I 
also too was trying other things I was trying the   marketing side of things I was actually trying 
photography for a little bit different kind of   skills to say is this something I enjoy and if 
it is something I enjoy maybe we'll be better   left as a hobby or is it potentially a career 
and for me if you want to learn a new skill or   play around or be curious about different things 
I have kind of a fun little rule that I put on   these which is the 10 minute rule spend 10 minutes 
every day learning this now what does this do we   all have 10 minutes that we can give to learning 
something new so first of all it takes off this   pressure of feeling as though you have to spend 
hours and hours a day to learn something new and   invest all this time only to not be sure if you 
really want to to go there or not and the second   thing this does is it makes you excited for me 
when I'm learning something new or exploring a   different area you know if I'm only spending 10 
minutes a day it just it makes me actually look   forward to it versus dread it because it's a long 
hour or I have to commit so much time and energy   towards it another way that really helped me in 
understanding the career path I wanted and to   understand my dream career was to look back and 
evaluate my past so I actually looked back at at   the time I was working at a large company and I 
I was kind of unhappy I was I was doing software   development work I've been doing it for five 
years I absolutely loved the software developer   work itself but I just there was something 
missing and I couldn't figure out what it was   so rather than just completely Jumping Ship 
thank goodness I didn't and being like I was   going to abandon this and learn a different skill 
completely I thought you know what I'm going to do   is look back over the past few months even years 
at what I really enjoyed about this job and about   other bosses and other career paths I have done 
and then also to most importantly what I have not   enjoyed and through that I quickly discovered that 
for me one of the big things is I like The Best   of Both Worlds I love technology I love code being 
in the weeds with it but then I also love people I   love teaching I love educating can I combine that 
in any way well that's how I ended up in developer   relations and that's my dream career and I am 
so excited about that but it took a lot of time   I mean you've seen me grow so much through this 
YouTube Channel Through Me sharing my honest and   authentic journey in Tech and that even what you 
land your first job your first career maybe it's   the right industry and you're very passionate 
about this industry like I am about technology   but then a few years in you're just like you 
know what this career path this role path is   not for me it doesn't mean completely jump ship 
and abandon the industry but rather take a look   back at your experience and think back as to what 
you enjoyed and didn't enjoy and if it's more   you're not enjoying maybe a big company culture 
or bosses that will give you good insight as to   what the real issue here is is it that you're just 
completely burnt out and over a certain industry   and career path or is it you just need a change 
and something to kind of switch it up another   big thing for me is visualization I know you're 
probably thinking Tiff I don't want to visualize   like what are you talking about but just just 
hear me out on this one if you take a few minutes   and really think about where you want to be in 
five years from now in 10 years from now where   what does that look like to you does it look like 
going into an office every day does it look like   leaving a teen collaborating with people building 
really interesting technology what does that look   like to you and of course through our different 
experiences and as we grow as people this will   change to what we think we want today to what 
we want in the future but it really gives us a   good sense and a good roadmap as to what our wants 
and needs are and where we want to be growing and   that's a huge aspect too for me example when 
I was thinking about what I want in the next   five years I knew I wanted to be remote I knew I 
wanted a high paying salary there's nothing wrong   with that I knew I wanted flexibility those are 
the three things and is there such a world where   you can get all these three things well yes of 
course there is and one of them being the career   path that I chose and I love that I was able to 
tick off all those three boxes that were really   important to me now maybe some of these are less 
important to you and and one or two of them are   more important to you or maybe they're all equal 
but it's really key to understand as to where you   see yourself in the future so you can align your 
learnings and your career goals based on that   for me even if I'm not at my complete dream say 
I wasn't I am but say it was not my complete   Green Path or dream career just knowing that 
you're actually taking the steps to get there   itself is so rewarding and fulfilling I 
think that you can be like you know what   I know I have to make this step or do this role 
for a little bit to get to my dream career and   I think that's really important too is just 
realizing that your first job your second job   your third job might not relate to your your 
biggest dream career but it takes time and I   think the journey is so rewarding on its own just 
being able to know that this is the direction you   want to go into and the last thing I really want 
to highlight here is we evolved we evolve and we   change so what does that mean well for finding 
your dream career it's important to do all the   things I mentioned to really help hone in on 
where interests lies and trying new things   and applying the 10-minute Rule and meeting and 
networking with other people or even if you don't   like networking at the very least just talking to 
under other people to hear about their experiences   the biggest takeaway though is we have I mean I 
have a computer sitting right here we have most   of us do anyways we have the internet at our 
fingertips and with that comes a lot of power   we can literally learn whatever we want whenever 
we want I think the biggest thing for me is the   biggest secret I realized is don't overthink it if 
you are passionate and interested about something   and you have gone through the different steps 
and it just seems to really be a good fit then   just go for it I think we truly live in a time 
where what we do today what we do for the next   decade doesn't have to equate to what we do for 
the following decade meaning I feel like in our   parents generation or you know depending on what 
age you are but for my parents genuine generation   anyways it was like you pick this career and this 
is what you are doing for the rest of your life   maybe at the same company for the rest of your 
life that's not the case anymore you want to be   a coder for 10 years and then you want to go be 
a project manager you can do that it is possible   you can continue to upskill and you and utilize 
those interchangeable skills as you grow in your   career and maybe some of you disagree with me 
maybe somebody like nope we need to become a   specialist and focus in you can 10 years is a long 
time you can become a specialist in something and   then get tired of that and want to change it up 
and that is totally okay don't let your decisions   make smart decisions that you can see yourself 
in this career path for a long time but don't   make decisions thinking about yourself and for 
example 30 years from now because we don't even   know what the workforce will look like it could be 
a completely different set of jobs so I think the   most important takeaway here is just continuing 
to be curious continue to learn and be open to new   things as they come your way because at the end 
of the day your dream job your dream career will   continue to evolve is you do too and that's why 
it's so important to stay open alright I hope you   really enjoyed this video it is a topic I am so 
passionate about having evolved in my career and   getting to a stage where I absolutely love what 
I do but also being aware that that could change   and I'm okay with that because I'm building real 
valuable skills now and that can be transferable   and that's what you can do too thank you both for 
watching I hope you found this video very valuable   and insightful if you do give it that thumbs 
up and I'll see you all soon thanks everyone back
