[Music] you can make seven figures working in Tech according to these articles apparently you can do anything seven figures and a drink you might be asking yourself today I'm going to be sitting down with you and breaking down what exactly are these articles trying to get at not only just that but well actually before I even get there I really want to share this isn't a get rich quick kind of thing or I'm really really against that but rather this video is the opposite I want to inform you and give you the knowledge that you are prepared when you are either entering the tech industry or searching for your next job and what that really consists of so you don't get skewed by these crazy articles I want to break down with you today Tech compensation so what that really entails what to be aware of and I also want to break down with you what exactly these articles are trying to get at at least when it means making a lot of money working in Tech and where I would say the majority of people do make a lot of money in Tech now listen it's not everyone there's a lot of normal paying jobs in Tech but I really want to kind of break down or demystify is that a word demystify yeah like I need glasses for that word demystify the tech industry and compensation okay let's get to it [Music] all right let's get to compensation and what it really entails I'm outside because it's one of the last nice days before it snows here in Toronto well no I shouldn't say that it won't snow for a while but it gets cold quickly as a Canadian all right if you want more information as well on compensation total compensation I definitely suggest you check out levels FYI you've probably heard me mention this quite a few times and it's because I absolutely love the resource mainly because they break down total compensation by location by company and by years of experience and by different roles so you can get really exact as to what you should expect all right let's jump into base salary base salary is a fixed amount of salary that you get for showing up at work well maybe you have to do a little bit more than just show up but it's something that is consistent that you get you know you are starting with when you are hired you know the exact amount and it's something that doesn't change now when I say it doesn't change of course as you grow with the company and in your role or to a new role your base salary typically will go up and it's also important to note that base salary isn't affected by how well the company is doing if a company is doing really well your base salary typically doesn't go up and if they start not doing so well it's not going to go down also something that's really important to note here is you will never become rich and I use that in quotations because it depends on your definition of rich but you will never become rich I guess you could say off of base salary typically you know you're not going to typically people don't make a seven figure base salary I'm not saying it's impossible of course there are companies where the c-level people will make that but on average don't count on your base salary for what makes you Rich it's gonna it can pay a lot high high six figures but it's not going to take you to that next level now let's talk about bonuses bonuses are usually paid on a semi-annual basis and this can vary company to company bonuses also can change based on what role you are in I would say there are typically three things that can really affect your bonus so one is level of seniority uh usually is taken into account for how much bonus you are getting of course the more senior you are typically the bigger bonus you get another thing is of course performance bonus is really closely related to Performance how well are you performing within the company what results are you showing and once again that can vary role to roll of course if you are in something like sales your bonus is probably going to be very important whereas if you're in engineering it's still important but it might not look the same the structure might be different and then the third one is company performance and once again doesn't mean for every company but a lot of companies include that in for the bonus as well to really help employees kind of believe in the company okay let's talk equity in stocks and equity in stocks especially Equity is something that really differentiates I would say most Industries and the tech industry now that's not to say always I feel like for everything I have to put a disclaimer and I'm going to stop doing that of course there's always butts and ifs and all of that but at the end of the day we're talking about tech here and I think more important than not is there's always different use cases I'm talking in general definitely Equity though is something that really sets the tech industry apart it's something that's a huge part of the tech industry and I think it's really because there are so many startups that really include Equity so what exactly does Equity even mean to be honest it's something that when I was getting into Tech I really had no idea what it meant and I was like just kind of living life really irresponsibly not knowing how compensation was broken down what it really entailed what I should be asking for and what I should expect and that's why I think this video is so important by the way so what does Equity really mean well it means a share of the company it signifies ownership and really motivates employees to work in the best interest of the company and how Equity works is it usually vests over a period of time so typically I would say four to five years and it can vests equally every month quarter or year so what does that even mean well think of it like this a vesting Cliff means the minimum period of time before your vestings Begins for example if you are granted 4 800 shares over a four year schedule with a one-year cliff and monthly investing you will get 1200 shares at the end of your first year and 100 shares every month thereafter for three years okay that was a lot to digest and I had to write that down in order to speak it but I guess what I'm trying to say is not all Equity is treated the same and it's not distributed the same this timelines are all different what I would suggest you to do and what I did when I started looking into equity and stocks and what does that all really mean is well I was kind of lucky because my partner is really good friends with a very very high up stock broker so they were able to really help guide me through the difficult questions and what questions to ask a company but if you don't have that resource I would suggest you spend some time really looking into equity and what it means and and what the averages are and I'll link some resources down below that really will help as well okay let's talk stock options are typically given by mid-stage companies stock options are usually the option or write or slash right to purchase stocks at a given price and it's not free it's not something that's just handed to you and I found some companies kind try and sell it to you that way and then you get in the contract stage or a reading contract whether it's been in my case or I've had friends that this happened to and they're like no no no it's not for free you're not just giving me something but they really sometimes try and work it in as though they are giving you the stock it's not the case so what it really means is you are guaranteed to be able to purchase the stock at the price regardless of the future increases so of course if you're working at a company that you really believe in you can purchase x amount of stock and you know that it's going to go up no you never know but you really believe it will you really hope it will that's what it comes down to a stock and then we have signing bonuses signing bonuses aren't with every company but they're with a lot and what they really entail is a one-time lump sum that you get when you are signing on with a company now the funny thing about signing bonuses is more often than not you don't get them on your first paycheck or second paycheck they are distributed I would say either throughout the year throughout first six months it's not just like a one lump sum kind of thing sometimes people or companies do signing bonuses that once you are off probation then you get the signing bonus so it's not as though you signed the contract and then you get the bonus and of course that is because I'm sure at one point in time people were signing contracts getting the signing bonus and then being like bye okay Tiffany this is not helping me get my seven figures you're teaching me about compensation which is great and it's very needed but let's go back to the Articles how am I gonna make a million dollars as an employee I'm so glad you asked well the reality is you're probably not definitely not in the short term I think if you are someone who is really interested in really uh acquiring a lot of money when you are working in tech one of the best ways to do it that I have seen people do it successfully is you have to play the game play the long game I think that's what it is play the long game well what does that mean as I mentioned earlier your base salary whether you jump around companies every year two years yes it will go up if you x amount whether it be ten thousand twenty thousand thirty thousand but it's not going to be life altering typically where you do have the opportunity to make quite a bit of money I would say is through stock and Equity now the thing is if you are going to be jumping around company to company a lot it's going to be hard to really acquire a lot of that in a short period of time one of my friends who is a cyber security engineer she was I think employee number 49 or 50 she was under the first 100 employees to get hired at Shopify and she was with them grew with them for many many years and by the time she left everything that she had invested in the company she was able to buy a gorgeous home with it and do a ton of other things so stories like that go back to my example that it's not about your base salary it's about other factors it's about the stock it's about the equity and what you choose to do with that now the thing is some companies that you are at you're kind of taking a bet in a way you have to really believe in the company you're at and that they will succeed in turn you will succeed because if you're with a company like this is not going to go anywhere or this is just not for me then you're gonna a hate your life and B you're not going to see your Roi on it as far as you know obviously your base salary you will or you might but in other ways you might not so my best advice to you if you are someone who really wants to reflect what these articles are saying or anything like that is to play the long game meaning pick a company that you really believe in that you truly want to grow with invest in it not just I'm not talking financially but I'm talking just like with something that you really believe in with yourself with your work with growing the company and this doesn't have to be necessarily a startup this could be a medium-sized company it could be even a large company that you just want to grow within and through that that is where the other part of this financial side that people keep on talking about you will find and once again this is not a get rich quick kind of video or look how much money you can make it's kind of the opposite I just want to be very clear here that you're not going to become this billionaire by having a really high base salary you're just not it's great to have a good base salary and whatnot but there's so much more to it than that and that's why I want to spend time really breaking down what compensation can entail and I say can because different companies incorporate different parts of it maybe one company doesn't offer a signing bonus Maybe one company doesn't offer stock different things like that but it's important to understand and be aware of it so when you are going into the situation of a getting your first job or your 10th job but you haven't done the research then it's gonna be really hard for you to be able to ask these questions and understand what it all entails whereas if you have done your research you understand each part you can confidently go into these interviews or conversations knowing what questions you should be asking okay I think that's a a day's a day's work for me all in a day all in a day is that what they say I'm really bad with these things anyways thank you all for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and found it very helpful and useful uh it's something that I wish I would have had someone connect with me on when I was first getting into the tech industry and I had to do a lot of research on my own to get there and it's it's complex and it's complicated and and it seems overwhelming at first when when someone breaks it down for you and it really relaxed and easy to understand way I hope you will it will click for you I like it did for me if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career videos leave in the comments what other videos do you want me to make because how I truly make my videos is based on what you want to see based on your questions and your feedback and I'll see you all soon bye everyone [Music]
