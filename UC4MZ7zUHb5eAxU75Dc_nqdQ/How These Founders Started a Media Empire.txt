sitting down with industry professionals to hear   about their career journeys and current roles 
i created this series to hear from people who   are established in the tech industry so that we 
can all learn what these individuals do in their   day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities 
that are out there okay let's get started   hi nora hi kate how's it going we're good going 
well thanks for having us thanks for being here   i'm really excited to hear about your journey and 
how you founded bank media and and hear more about   it but before we get into it i'd love to hear 
more about yourselves nora i'll start with you   yeah sure um so my name is nora i am co-founder at 
bank and um yeah i moved to toronto when i was 17.   originally i moved the first time when i was 
three my parents and i immigrated here and we   became canadian moved back home until i finished 
high school and then i moved here when i was 17.   um from there was just like a bunch of different 
experience in social media that kind of stuff   different agencies and then everything was like 
a stepping stone and it feels like it all led to   meeting this girl and starting our business 
together wow two years ago two years ago yeah   kate what about yourself um i'm kate the other 
half of bank and i'm just from outside of toronto   i've been here for almost eight years now which 
is crazy went to school here and it feels like i   kind of grew up in the city even but um nur and i 
met i feel like five years ago now and that's how   we first started like working together got to know 
each other and it just like really spiraled from   there into this but it's been such a crazy few 
years especially of bank and like the years before   that even i feel like they've gone by so fast i 
bet i bet well you know we keep on mentioning bank   now let's talk about bank what exactly is bank for 
those of that are not as familiar with it and uh   how did it come to life yeah so bank is a social 
media digital creative agency um we even hate the   word agency it feels like a little bit outdated 
for what we do we we kind of offer everything   that a e-commerce digital business would need 
in the space so we offer social media management   content creation photo shoot production influencer 
marketing email marketing everything that's kind   of organic and and not on the paid side but we 
really focus into the like kind of fast-paced   day-to-day execution tick tock really is a crazy 
space we focus on right now because not a lot of   agencies can create content on the go match the 
trends keep up to date you really need someone   either in-house or on the ground to kind of create 
that stuff and we have been able to put together   a solid team that can really like keep up with it 
that's huge and you mentioned tick tock it's one   of those things that yeah trend is something that 
is comes and goes so quick that if you're not able   to keep up with it you're just going to miss it 
exactly it's crazy how fast things happen and i   think that like we said from like an agency side 
it's really hard to keep up with that if you're   not like on the ground actually executing getting 
it done because it's when you're having to like   outsource and go to different people that by the 
time you get it it's it's past so being able to   act fast i feel like it's like such a huge thing 
in the industry especially as someone who's like   representing brands you have to be able to keep 
them up to date with it exactly exactly going back   five years ago when you first met how did you meet 
and and what was your journey together like we met   at a startup um very fitting i feel like for where 
we are now but uh when we first started there nura   was the first hire i was the second hire and 
because of that we were in the ground running   like you're doing a million different roles you 
get to see all sides of the business and we really   quickly realized that we have very complementary 
skills and did different sides of it so we   worked at the startup for a few years we did like 
freelance on the side together and we just saw how   well we worked together and like that we had what 
the other didn't so it was great it definitely i'd   say started as a work relationship turned into a 
friendship um but i think like her when we first   met she was she didn't know me when we first 
met sometimes that's how the best relationships   though are formed you know what i mean yeah yeah i 
think it was needed yeah we say that we joke about   it now because the funny thing is how big started 
was entering the pandemic we moved in together um   it was you remember toronto had the worst 
lockdown ever and we couldn't go to each   other's homes you couldn't really leave your house 
there's so much that you couldn't do and we wanted   to start a business and we couldn't like work 
would take so much longer to do it on zoom and   kate's an incredible designer and i am not at all 
i don't design i'm more on the strategy side but   i would send ideas back and forth and like the 
communication just wasn't working so she calls me   and she's like look my roommate just left like do 
you want to move in and i was like hell yeah yeah   dude we had no separation from each other 
it was like coveted lockdown we're forced   to live with each other we're working together 
non-stop like we literally shared forks like   we were just like inseparable for months i 
almost gave her covid in the very beginning   and you're still here together today so clearly 
it works it works yeah that's great um well   that's another question i had for you is a lot 
of people who are looking to start a business   or getting into more of an entrepreneurship type 
role some of them well most of them want to do it   with a partner with someone that they know like 
a business partner so how did you know that it   sounds like a dating question almost but how 
did you know that you two were right for each   other for creating a business like was it kind 
of nerve-wracking going into it with a friendship   uh were you was there any kind of fears of that 
or absolutely not i think that because of our   background and where we came from we started off 
working together we freelanced together we also   seen different relationships we knew exactly what 
we wanted and what we didn't want and we were on   the same page about it and like kate mentioned 
earlier our skill sets are so complementary   so it just was it went hand in hand and then 
we're also super chill people so it wasn't like   complicated it didn't feel like someone was out of 
line or like someone was in each other's like lane   it just it was like a puzzle piece it fit it made 
sense and i feel like it's rare you know we don't   always recommend friends doing business together 
but i think it just really like worked hand in   hand for us and we were lucky that way yeah yeah 
and i feel like we both even say that like there   isn't somebody else that we could see each other 
doing it with just because it is really hard   with a friend like if you don't have the same 
work ethic or the same like work style even so   i feel like the fact that we did start in a work 
relationship it's like we know how the other works   we know what we're bringing to the table from both 
sides and i definitely get the appeal of wanting a   co-founder because we say countless times so like 
i couldn't do this on my own just because like   the highs the lows you have to go through them 
on your own it's a lot more challenging so being   able to have somebody with it that has the same 
like intentions and has the same like passions   about it i feel like is so much better it makes 
a huge difference it's funny because our moms   say we look alike and we don't see it we don't 
think our features are like at all but my mom will   screenshot videos of kate and send it to me and 
be like you look so good here in nura and i'm like   you gave birth to me that's not your daughter like 
you should know that's hilarious i love it's your   mom's too like you better people who know you 
the most that's awesome that's great okay let   me scroll down here for some other questions i 
have um what was the first moment you felt [ __ ]   was successful you know you've been in it now for 
two years so relatively new but what was that aha   moment um i mean i feel like we we feel the same 
way about this we talk about it all the time but   most entrepreneurs you'll meet most business 
owners they're never going to tell you like oh   i feel successful we made it yeah anyone we ask 
or any mentor anyone we're just like like where   are you at how are you feeling as soon as you hit 
your goal you're looking at another one it feels   like you've already passed it but for us it's kind 
of like we have this like list of things that we   wanted to achieve and and have achieved some have 
not but haven't ever felt like oh my god we made   it i think the first time that we looked at each 
other and we were like yeah we did that was just   at our two year we were we're having lunch with 
our team and um one major thing that kate and i   we like really wanted when we first started was to 
create a space that felt safe to work at a place   that people wanted to be a place that people felt 
valued our we were first and second higher ones   you know so we wanted we know what it felt like 
and we know what we wanted to create and sitting   at lunch we had our team walk around the table and 
everyone shared their like rose bud and thorn and   rose is like you know like your peak your 
highlight yeah thorin is like the least thing you   enjoy or but is something you look forward to and 
it was so great listening to everyone but i feel   like the consistent theme on everyone was just 
that they just feel hurt and they feel valued and   they are they were just thanking us for creating 
this place and we just kind of like looked at   each other like yeah we did that that's huge that 
gives me chills yeah it's the most important thing   as you know when you are an employee to feel heard 
to feel valued because that's missing in a lot of   a lot of places we were just so proud i think that 
was like our main goal at the beginning we're like   we're so proud that we hit that two years in and 
we haven't had high turnover everyone that's been   with us has either been with us from the beginning 
or joined in the last few months and it's like   just means the world that that's something we 
were able to create that is congratulations   thank you that's huge i feel like our team is 
like such a huge part of our success and like   where we are even and it's obviously only been two 
years and there's now 11 of us including nur and   myself and it's crazy to be able to like look at 
that and see so many other people like having that   same intention as us and like feeling the same way 
about it i think that [ __ ] has given us such an   opportunity to not only like bring out what we 
want to life but also like give our team that   opportunity and like bring them in that sense and 
everybody's been growing into their own roles so   well in the beginning similar to when we started 
it's like you wear every hat and you do everything   whereas we've gotten to more of like a stable 
place now that each individual can do what they   really love and like focus on and i think that's 
just been like a huge part being able to see like   how happy they are and excited about like coming 
into work so i think that was like the biggest   moment for us but definitely agree with nara that 
there's never gonna be a time when you're like   i made it i'm successful it's like always thinking 
about what's coming next and like what more you   can be doing to get there yeah exactly exactly 
if you're yeah you're right if you're thinking   i've made it i'm so successful then you're you're 
putting too low of a ceiling on yourself or too   low of goals you always have to be continuing to 
to reach for more and if you're like comfortable   in the position you're in it's it's not going to 
stay you know things are going to consistently   change and i think especially the industry that 
we're in it changes like we said so fast that   if you're not keeping up with that and you're 
just like content with where you're sitting   you're going to fall behind so it's a matter of 
like constantly having to look at what's next   and try and get there exactly i'm really curious 
about this because it's something that i always   we are speaking earlier i always go back and 
forth about but how did you find the courage or   i don't know what the right word is but going from 
having a nine to five and i know you mentioned   you were freelancing together but still having 
that stable income and when i say stable i mean   you know secure when you're just starting versus 
when you're just starting a business how did you   find the courage or when did you know it was the 
right time to just be like okay i'm done the nine   to five we're starting this business fully and 
immersing ourselves in it well i mean that's where   it really goes into timing and faith like the 
pandemic was such a key moment in our story um the   world stopped for a second you know it was like 
everything that was so fast-paced we it was kind   of pushed us into a corner where we're like it's 
now or never like if there was ever a better time   the industry needs what we do so much right now 
so many businesses can't be in real life everyone   is digital everyone needs content we can do that 
and we can help all of these businesses locally   and that's where we started we built a list of 
all local businesses that we love and we wanted   to work with and we started taking them off as we 
got to start to work with them create content just   we started like money was never a thing budgets 
were never a thing we just wanted to work work   work work and and get our names out there and show 
what we could do as a pairing and not just as a   as freelancers and i think it was just the timing 
so it was i know how daunting it can be to like   pull the plug on like security and a nice paycheck 
um but i think it was just really the fact that it   was like now or never you know we can circle back 
later in the future we can get another job but   it's not like we're going out to dinners anytime 
soon exactly exactly yeah and i think it was just   also like we realized we were at a point that if 
we wanted to take this full time and this is like   truly what we wanted to do you can't rely on that 
nine to five and yeah to be honest neither of us   really loved that as like a structure i feel like 
coming from a startup is obviously very different   um we both had experience in like corporate jobs 
as well that we did not love it didn't have like   the creative freedom you want but we were doing 
our jobs and then doing this as a secondary thing   and it was just like you're sitting there 
with like multiple computers oops sorry   you're sitting there with multiple computers open 
in front of you all day long because it's like   all right my work computer and then my bank 
computer and like it was just non-stop so it got   to a point where we both looked at each other and 
we're just like we know what we're building here   we know what we're going to be able to do with 
this so if we want to actually take this full time   you just have to make that leap and it wasn't 
that big of a jump for us we were like ready   to do it so it was really exciting moment but not 
something that was too challenging for us to like   make that decision on we spoke about this a minute 
ago but i think it's the biggest thing that we   say to any of our friends or anyone that's like 
what's the biggest mistake you know founders   make early on and we're like one foot in one 
foot out yeah if you're going in just jump you   know there's no point in starting a business if 
you're not eating breathing sleeping your business   just don't do it because it's your baby it needs 
all of you and it just makes no sense like you're   going to invest everything and you'll be like 
it didn't work you didn't put it all in exactly   exactly that's that's really kind of how our 
mindset was we're just gonna just go for it i   love it what was it like landing your first client 
yeah um so it's funny actually because one of our   our first official client as bank because we did 
freelance together was um was the startup that we   worked together at so that was a full circle 
moment for us that that meant the world because   um it was just kind of like a 
testament testament is that the right it was a testament to our work and that um 
it carried through into our next business so   that was huge and then the next moment that i 
feel like we kind of were like okay pinch me   was when gwen's team reached out and we supported 
in the launch and continued to work with them on   their on their social and influencer and that 
moment that we flew to la we flew our team out   and we got to produce the shoot and then 
we also got to kind of work with gwen   we were working so hard that we didn't get to like 
lift our heads up and just like be like wait what   the hell is happening and then we were you know 
it was one day that we were in her makeup room   with her and she was telling us how um she used to 
work at a makeup counter and that's what led the   road to her launching a makeup brand which is what 
we talk about when we say the authenticity and not   just another celebrity brand like it made sense 
like when you think red lips who do you think of   her of course right like icon um so i think it 
was that moment that like we walked out of that   room and we just looked at each other and we're 
like is this real what the [ __ ] yeah it's like   a moment that you actually feel like you're like 
not in it because in the moment you're not going   to be freaking out or like oh my god it's gwen 
stefani and when we left we're just like side   eyes to each other like that that's happening like 
this is real yeah wow yeah so that's incredible   her team is absolutely like amazing to work 
with her internal team at give and and um yeah   it's just been one of the things that we're like 
okay that was really cool a pinch me moment yeah   how did you okay one last question around that 
then is because that's it's huge it's huge and   did you face any kind of imposter syndrome 
or doubts obviously you knew in your heart   of hearts and that you were more than capable of 
of course but just that impostor syndrome of like   nerve nerves or feeling like oh my gosh like i 
think this was one of the moments that we actually   didn't like i think this it was one of the moments 
that we got the we got the referral from another   client that we did great work for so it was just 
earned and it was at a later stage in our business   where we had a solid team that could handle the 
work could support and from the beginning we were   just you know blowing it out of the water like 
it was just a great great experience and yeah i   would say like coming a long way i feel like 
we were more nervous about our first project   yeah because it was still us figuring out our 
system and our routine but this was this wasn't   in more than a year in so i think it was one 
of those moments that we're like we got this   we got this yeah and like we went into it feeling 
really confident in what we did and like we had   our team already at that point that knew what they 
were doing and it was like we didn't feel like we   were jumping in over our heads we were like we 
know exactly how to approach this exactly what   we're going to do to like make this successful 
and i think that going in with like that behind   us made it feel so much more confident and like so 
much easier to just jump into it let's talk about   funding so for people who are looking to start a 
business or make that leap what is some advice you   would give around finding if someone is looking to 
find funding did you have to find funding if you   don't mind me asking or what was that process like 
you know you're starting a new business we have no   funding to start but we're also very good at being 
lean and i think that'd be our best advice for   like anybody no matter what industry you're trying 
to get into whatever business try and be as lean   as you can in the beginning i think it's like kate 
said we haven't had we didn't have any funding to   start we didn't have any funding period ever today 
to clarify i think it was literally just like   again two girls in their apartment doing the best 
possible work we could do but thank you pandemic   it was normal to be out of our apartment everyone 
was out of there we were we were camouflaged we   were competing with major agencies but they also 
were on zoom so it was like it just like worked   and um the other piece was whatever we made we 
put back it you know it was just kind of all   funneled in and like allowed us to hire allowed 
us to keep moving so it was like that that lean   mechanism that kate mentioned yeah invest back 
into your business i think it's huge and now   your team of 11 just opened up an office like yes 
yes it's been exciting that is really exciting   what how has your definition of success changed 
over the past two years um i think that kate just   kind of mentioned it we originally the idea the 
successful mission was to fund a product-based   business we launched bank as a way to generate 
capital for us to be the investors that launch   our product because obviously launching a product 
for a service base you need a lot more capital and   it was like one thing led to the next and we just 
we're like wait a second we're on to something   and from there um i think our goals just pivoted 
and shifted into okay now we want to scale   now we need to understand how to build the 
best place to work how to develop a team that's   motivated um and just keep growing that direction 
it became like how do we land this client how   do we grow into this space and and yeah just 
figuring out the next milestone we want to hit   it's amazing yeah it's so true it's great that you 
didn't have blinders on you know when you went in   as you mentioned starting this the service part 
of it and thinking okay we're going to use it to   fund the product part but you weren't so obsessed 
or with blinders on i say like that you had to do   it you're flexible you're like okay agile i'm 
going to i know that's such a trendy word but   it's true you know you're like agile as far 
as hey this is working this is really growing   let's explore this instead and see what happens 
trust it trust the universe and this is another   thing for all business owners like sometimes 
you have an idea and like the world wants you   somewhere else and if it's working trust it pivot 
don't be afraid to it doesn't mean you failed   does not mean you failed your original mission 
it just meant that that was a stepping stone to   lead you to where you're meant to be i love 
that i totally agree okay let's talk about   the influencer marketing industry a little bit 
so it is so saturated now and in your opinion   how has it changed since you first started even 
two years ago yeah i'll take this so just so you   know kate does our social she's our creative 
director she manages our social management and   i lead more of the influencer side and like the 
business development so for influencers it's a   different world entirely different i remember 
when i first started i was at another agency   um much more like structured very traditional 
media this was like a few years back   and i remember influencer marketing wasn't a thing 
like there was no name for it yeah you couldn't   like say i wanted to influence your marketing it 
was just like i know a couple girls on instagram   i think that we should invite them to this event 
and i would pitch that to like the founders i'd   pitch it to my managers and i would just be like i 
know that this could work yeah and they would just   be like all right and i'm sitting there being like 
i know that this is not conventional but just like   i am shopping what they're wearing 
yes you're appealing to a younger   demographic this is where they're at and this 
was like brick wall cute photo era of instagram   um so that's that's kind of where it was and now 
you're it's like evolved into this place that if   businesses it used to be like an add-on like you 
maybe do some influencer marketing but now it's   like part of the marketing strategy yeah and it 
needs to be so like specific because you can't   just like randomly gift people you can't randomly 
select budgets like it has become a whole business   and a whole like sector that you can't sleep 
on because if you don't you're behind yeah yeah   businesses solely rely on it right now i know it's 
it's crazy i um when i was i was looking at uh   because vidcon's going on right now and i was 
scrolling through social media and i saw someone   i followed was going to the talk where uh duolingo 
duolingo am i saying that we're obsessed we're   upset they're so really nice do an amazing amazing 
job on socials we talk about it non-stop with our   team and it's just like every day we'll send a 
new tick tock from them or something their social   manager has done such an amazing job with like the 
community side of it or anyone that doesn't know   it's an app yeah and it's something that we would 
not normally be interested in what is it teaches   you to learn languages learn languages but they 
are they have the most incredible tik tok it's   so entertaining you don't need to be interested 
in the app but they just do an incredible job   and that's like the power of it so we're obsessed 
and i think it's kudos to whoever whomever allowed   initially who was open-minded and initially to 
to the social team being able to to start this   because that could have got shut down so quickly 
like no no not us it's not our eye great great   leadership and they even make jokes about that 
on their tick tock and stuff like sometimes   she'll post a video that like social manager 
and have the caption about like i'm gonna get   fired when my boss sees this yeah and it's like 
they allow them to push those boundaries and i   think that's something that a lot of larger scale 
corporate companies don't allow which is again one   of the biggest like challenges we've seen in our 
experience as well as just like from the outside   if you're not open to these like new ways and like 
gen z man it's taking over you have to be open to   that and you have to be adaptable because you're 
going to fall behind you're not going to be able   to keep up with the current like social marketing 
kind of piece to it yeah yeah it's so true going   back to uh you know speaking of social media and 
influencers what are some things that you look for   i know you mentioned you're more on the influencer 
side nora uh what are some things you look for   in influencers is it followers engagement quality 
of content all of the above what's your the focus   so i think that right now it's like the micro 
and macro influencer there's no there's no   like a macro influencer is better than micro i 
think that's a misconception that you think you   need to have a massive following it's obviously 
fantastic but we build strategies on both sides   so following does not is not something that i look 
at first because if you have a lower following you   could be a great addition to our micro list and if 
you have a larger following you could be a great   addition on the other list i think engagement is 
so key but engagement is an in like direct link to   your authenticity on your page um the best we've 
seen is niched influencers because you're not just   marketing every possible thing that anyone sends 
you you're really speaking to a loyal following   so whenever we're searching we really kind of tie 
it to our client are we looking at someone in the   beauty space in the influencer sorry in the skin 
care space and the tech space like we find kind   of people that appeal to our client and we look at 
their demographic who watches how do they engage   and are you yourself are you just you know pushing 
whatever and i think that's where when we find   influencers we connect with and we believe what 
they're saying that's when we find the biggest   like conversion um within our campaigns that's 
huge and i would even say that there's almost two   sides to it and like from the social side it's 
more like what is your goal so is your goal   selling it and is it like getting the exposure and 
marketing around it or is it the content because   so many brands struggle with content i feel 
like because like we said it happens so fast and   there's so many changes in it that if your goal is 
content um they're technically still influencers   but like we highlight them as content creators 
and so they might not have a huge following   they might not have a crazy engagement but if 
they're creating the content that your brand   needs that's going to be so much more valuable 
for you to be than using on your page so it's   really what the goal of who you're looking for 
is and then trying to find that right person   when brands come to you or companies come to you 
do they usually have do they know what they want   or do they come to you and be like we kind of 
know what we want but can you help us figure it   out almost i don't know if that makes sense it 
depends yeah sometimes yes sometimes no i think   most of the conversations are around what 
the goal is what you're hoping to achieve   sometimes we work with teams and they have 
great um marketing teams internally and we   work with them as an extension so it works hand 
in hand and we're like you know double the power   sometimes we are working with teams that are 
kind of like this is what we hope to achieve   and we don't know how to create it and we present 
you know a full-fledged strategy so it kind of is   depending on the founder the team what scale 
of their business they're at but depends   with all those okay so let's talk a little bit 
about you know kind of what we were speaking   about with content and standing out but especially 
right now i find and really for the past few few   years celebrities uh pushing out beauty brands 
or pushing out different kind of brands and it's   it's noisy out there there's a lot of things 
going on how do you ensure that the brands you   work with stand out maybe the smaller ones 
or you know not the massive brands i guess   you could say i think it's crazy though because 
even from like the large scale brands obviously   um celebrity brands are huge there's so many 
consistently coming out it feels like especially   this year it's like every single week there's a 
new brand and they're all in the same space so   it's a matter of how you're positioning yourself 
to stand out and i think a big part of that is   authenticity especially if you have like 
a huge face of the brand it has to feel   authentic and has to feel like they're 
actually involved in it not just like   slapping their name on it this is my thing and 
i think the validation as well because that's   going to initially sell it and it's going to 
be like oh wow i want to get this product from   whoever i'm obsessed with but once you actually 
try it you need the validation behind the product   and a lot of people are bringing in experts 
to speak to it on their internal teams or   positioning here's how we're different whether 
it's speaking to like the formulation the   ingredients the community aspect but it's really 
having to differentiate yourself in that way   and then from a smaller brand perspective i think 
it's again how you're presenting yourself yeah and   i think content has a huge play in that because 
that's what's going to capture people's attention   and like tension spans are short so you have 
to make sure that you're consistently up on it   and i feel like we're repetitive in what we're 
saying but it's just like making sure you're   staying with these trends making sure that you're 
staying true to yourself as well because if you're   copying somebody you're always going to be one 
step behind and you are going to fall behind   that's so true you know going back to attention 
spans i i uh my my boyfriend in the evening he   sits on the couch and then goes on it drives 
me nuts but he doesn't put his social media   on silent and i'm like can you just please put 
on silent but i found it so interesting because   just as a human behavior it's like it's every 
maybe one to two seconds it's a different noise   it's a different sound it's a different sound and 
i just was watching it and i'm like wow like as a   creator myself i'm like there's no attention span 
it's so little anymore that you have to catch them   in one to two seconds like literally 
just like what what and then he'll   stop and he'll watch for a little bit one and 
then it will be going again and going again   yeah it's really interesting from like a human 
behavioral side of things yeah i watched um a   netflix documentary i'll send it to you later 
i can't remember the name but it was like   it was all about it was from the founding 
team members at facebook at google at snapchat   whatever and they were just talking about how 
turn your notifications off just like trust   us like already we are just our job is to come 
up with ways to keep you in the app internally   longer on the pages longer and obviously this 
is against our job because we're also like   how do we capture people's attention longer but 
as humans and as like individuals like we say this   all the time we need to disconnect from our phones 
like we work all day long that's eight hours that   we need to be on social media like it's not like 
an office space where we're like put your phones   down and work yeah exactly you need to be on the 
outside immerse in it we eat breathe sleep so   sometimes we're just like oh turn it off yeah like 
just shut it all off shut it all off all the noise   so do you think for anyone who's watching this who 
wants to get into who wants to be an influencer or   content creator i know you mentioned uh niching 
down is always a good way to start um do you   think if they're choosing one platform would it 
be tick tock right now or yeah i know definitely   tick tock you can grow on tick tock right now but 
not for long like obviously the app will have it's   a quicker cycle yeah but instagram is it's so 
hard now it's so saturated also instagram is   trying so hard to be tick-tock yes it's sad and 
it's it's like the same features but not as good   right now you scroll your feed you don't even see 
who you follow anymore it's really awkward i'm   like i don't even like scrolling stories are the 
one thing that's kind of relevant right now but   with all that it's just the app doesn't convert 
the same way people don't find you the same way   whereas tick tock the growth is crazy right now 
like you could just and it's the for you page and   it's done so well that everyone's trying to copy 
it but it it will if you create quality content   you will and consistently yeah you will do really 
well on tick tock do you think with instagram it's   going to become i mean you know everyone says it 
will become the next facebook or it is already the   next facebook do you think there will always be a 
space for that will always be used for a space for   marketing still just as we as the demographic on 
instagram ages it's just targeting different you   know products towards that age group i don't know 
what we say now is we kind of use instagram like   our business card like it's your portfolio 
photographers show off their work i network   that's where i meet a lot of people that we end up 
working with so it's it's still necessary and for   businesses it's more it's like transitioning 
into more of like an e-commerce platform you   can shop it you have a great page it's still 
necessary it has not become obsolete yes yet but   um i it really depends on what the updates the 
next coming updates are they gonna listen to   their community are they gonna list and they're 
trying i don't know if you know about the drop   down menu that allows you to like see your feed 
like chronologically or you see your friends like   yes so they they're they're updating things that 
are trying to like listen to the customer base   so it could it could work out but as of right now 
people are spending a lot more time on tick tock   so i think that might especially the younger 
generation it's kind of like everyone's like on   snapchat and tick tock and like ignoring instagram 
so we'll see what happens yeah it's funny actually   too instagram recently had an update where again 
trying to be like tick tock they made your home   page full screen and when you scrolled it was so 
bad and like out of our whole team we were all   just like waiting like no one wanted to get it and 
i got it and i did not use the app for like over a   week almost because it's just like when you're 
scrolling the user like experience was so bad   and it's just like trying so hard to be something 
that it's not it's not giving you the right type   of marketing that you're wanting to be getting 
out of it and within a week it was switched back   and i think it just shows that it's like at least 
instagram is somewhat listening to their community   so they realize like what's working versus 
what isn't but i do think that they need to   somehow update because they're really really 
falling behind the screen time was so down   it was so bad like the difference it made and i'm 
like i have to use it for work so i'm obviously   still in the app but i was not on my personal 
page i was switching to like our business one   because our business page hadn't uh changed and 
i was just like i'm not using my personal account   anymore because it was such a huge difference so i 
think that it's just like looking at instagram as   like your second e-commerce platform more as like 
a website education and like keep the traction of   like engaging with your followers but it's not 
having the same type of reach as a tick-tock   is anymore no yeah i always end on this note which 
is what advice would you give to your younger self um i think that i would just 
say to never question my value   um to kind of believe the ideas that i had and 
continue to have and just make sure that if you're   speaking to someone and they don't understand it 
yet to take it okay because they will eventually   i feel like my answer is similar in a sense but 
don't take no for an answer and with that it's   like you are going to hear it a lot no matter 
what it is that you're trying to do and don't   take that as like well i'm right and i know i'm 
right but take it as like okay what can i learn   from this to be better for next time um there's 
always going to be people that tell you no and   if you know that you have a good idea and you 
know that it's going to work just keep trying   yeah i totally agree i always say the more knows 
you hear the better because it means you're you're   pushing the boundaries you're doing different 
things and people like to stay comfortable they   don't like to think outside the box or what 
could be so they just shut it down with a no   thank you both so much for being here today i feel 
so inspired listening to both of your stories and   where you're at today and i'm so excited 
to see where bank media will go it's just   going to continue to flourish and take 
over the world thank you for having us our instinctness
