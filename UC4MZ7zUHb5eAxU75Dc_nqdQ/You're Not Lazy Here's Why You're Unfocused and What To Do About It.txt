have you ever felt like this before tired lethargic and no energy to do anything even though you know you need to do it if you have felt this way before you are definitely not alone I have felt this way so many times throughout my studies learning something new whether it be a technical thing or a soft skill and then now today in my career this brings up the question are you lazy or are you just unfocused and better yet how to regain focus in this video I'm going to share with you the best tips to really hone in and focus on what you're doing to be productive not for a long period of time but rather quality over quantity okay let's go oh and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button leave down in the comments other topics you want me to cover this is how I make the videos okay now let's go [Music] the green screen I hope it's not bad that I'm wearing green first let's talk a little bit about burnout and when I say burnout I'm really referring to the mental burnout that we feel after a long day have you ever been sitting at your desk wondering wow it's 5 p.m but I don't feel like I've accomplished anything I remember feeling that way all the time and wondering where did the time go what did I actually do today those feelings of not accomplishing something through the day or wondering where the time went first of all they're completely normal second of all the positive news is there are so many ways to really combat these feelings a lot of times these feelings of unaccomplishing anything throughout the day they actually stem from not having a scheduled date and what I mean by that is if you take the time every morning or at the beginning of a week to actually schedule your goals throughout the week it will really help you have a better sense of focus where to put your energy and time now I'm sure you've heard this tip before but here is what a lot of people don't share about it it's not just about setting goals and having goals throughout your week to achieve but it's about ensuring they are are realistic now for me what I will do to ensure I'm setting realistic goals is I will actually set goals that are smaller than what I think is realistic so for example if I want to achieve creating two videos this week working on a project for developers at work and say connecting with three or networking with three individuals for work okay that's my goal for the week or goals for the week now if I was to write them down realistically I think you know what Tiff you can definitely achieve that so just write them down it's going to be good to go as is what I've started to do though is take those goals and actually still minimize them what this does is two things it takes off a lot of pressure takes off that pressure of oh my gosh I have so much to do throughout the week and then the other thing it does is you put the nice to haves down below so it kind of goes back to we spoke about this before the ABC method where the A's are your a priorities things that need to get done throughout the week no matter what the bees are the nice to haves ideally you would do them but if not it's going to be okay and the C's are great they don't need to get done they can wait till the following week but if you get to them and have extra time so be it this list always really helps me stay focused and know what I'm working on throughout the day but even if you have this list and you are super focused here is the other problem that comes in you can have as organized of a task or a day as you would like to have planned but if you have distractions in your home or in your office space you're going to fail so what do I mean by distractions well for one let's State the obvious your phone I don't know about you but the phone is one of the biggest culprits for distractions even if you're not planning on going on social media or messaging your friends getting these notifications on your phone it can't help but be tempting to look at it and then when you do look at it you easily get sucked into that Wormhole of continuing to go on your phone for longer look at different things only to put down your phone and be in this fog unfocused again unmotivated wondering where what do I still have to do so I will actually physically put my phone in a different room versus having it sit next to me and that's a huge thing identifying what causes distractions for you and finding ways to eliminate that alongside though not just finding ways to eliminate it but also finding ways to reward yourself with those distractions at a certain point so for example what I'll do is I will time block I will set say two hours aside where I will focus I will focus on coding focus on building whatever I'm working on and I know after those two hours I would get rewarded by getting to go on my phone which sounds kind of strange I feel like it's like a kid who gets rewarded with an iPhone or an iPad but you get the gist of it we're only human so I will actually set rewards for myself after working for a specific period of time also as a side note do not set these time limits to be working for four hours or five hours without any breaks I've seen these videos where people say how I study for eight hours a day in my opinion that's not really not realistic but it's also not healthy for your brain and you won't retain all that information as much as you would hope to now here's the key thing here is the key thing I really wanted to talk to you about of how I am able to stay focused or feel most I want to I don't want to use the word motivation but it really is that motivation to carry on through the day when you really really just want to relax or you're feeling kind of lazy let's say the biggest one for me that took the longest time for me to learn was actually to take breaks and I remember when I first started out in my Tech Career I often would be like I need to work seven days a week so I'd work Monday to Friday then Saturday and Sunday would be all this work for Tiffin Tech and just it was never ending I would constantly be working because I thought that was what success looked like I thought if I was working all the time putting all this energy towards something I would see results now I'm sure you're not surprised but what happened actually was I got burnt out and instead of seeing results I just saw kind of results but I was really tired what I decided to do after many trial and error and as I actually take the weekends off what they're supposed to be for yeah sometimes I'll have to work on a Saturday or a Sunday to create some content because my week is mainly focused on my day job of course but it does what I do prefer to do is actually work more efficiently for example filming this video at 8am in the morning on Wednesday versus filming it Saturday at 12 pm because what this allows me to do is if I structure my time so that during the week it's a bit more hectic having those two days off to really reset really helps me honestly enjoy life more and it's one of those things that when Monday comes I'm not dreading it I'm not like oh you know I was working Saturday and Sunday I kind of feel like working today don't have a lot of energy no when Monday comes I'm ready for it I'm excited for it those are my main tips on really how to structure and put your energy towards better focusing you're not lazy it's just a lot of us fall into these societal uh habits of feeling or thinking we are lazy just because we aren't motivated but there's so many little tricks and tips that I've shared with you today that you can Implement to not only feel more focused but really switch everything that you don't need to have this burst of energy but if you implement some of these tips you will be better focused for shorter periods of time get more work done so then you can properly rest thank you all for watching this video I hope you found it very helpful and valuable if you haven't already
