okay Mike is on I'm kind of nervous for this video I'm not gonna lie is coding going to remain in demand in 2023 is it still worth to learn how to code if you are having these thoughts you are definitely not alone my DMs have been filled with these comments Tiff do I still learn how to code is it worth it I'm seeing things like chat GPT all these AIS coming out and essentially they can do what I can do but better and faster what am I needed for if you have had these thoughts I am here with you and I've also seen a lot of posts out there a lot of developers being like the only way you're going to die out is if you don't adopt these tools if you adopt them you're going to succeed well I'm here to tell you some jobs regardless of how much you adopt this technology in these AIS some jobs are still going to be overtaken I'm going to explain to you and really get into that very shortly here but before we do that make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career related content leave in the comments any questions you have any thoughts any opinions I want to hear it all and as always I answer every single one of your questions or comments you can challenge me to that by leaving a comment down below a question and I'll do my best to answer it all right let's jump into it thank you one thing I really want to highlight is the term coding itself is such a generic term can mean so many different things what are you coding what are you building what languages are you working with are you working on data science are you working on web development what's the purpose of your coding so when we ask questions like is coding going to remain in demand it's really asking this very generic question that you can't give a specific answer to now that being said of course we are going to try and answer it as I was mentioning I keep on seeing all of these posts about how if you don't adopt the technology or the AI you will become obsolete but if you do you're good easy and good to go the reality is that's not the case a lot of jobs regardless of how much you adopt to the technology and two using these AIS in your everyday life some jobs are still going to be overtaken including a lot of jobs in technology it would be so silly to think that our jobs are somewhat special or they are exempt from technology taking over other Tech workers jobs that's not the reality but it's not all doom and gloom and what I mean by that is I think what will happen if I'm giving my personal my Tiff and Tech opinion is we're going to see coding continue to be in demand but it's going to be looked at more so as a tool in your tool belt I feel like that's a horrible example but what I mean by that is gone are the days where you can get away with being these super crazy developers who you know you're amazing at coding but that's the only skill you have you could be the best coder on the planet or self-proclaimed but you don't have any social skills team building skills collaboration skills you just want to code and maybe there are still some instances where that is fine in different companies but if we are talking about being in demand as a coder at a company those days are pretty much gone you cannot just let the code speak for yourself or get hired just based on being this amazing coder and some of you might be thinking well Tiff actually yes you can they need Specialists they need that yeah they do but guess what you can be a specialist you can be an amazing coder and also have other skills to go alongside it and I really want to bring this up because I think a lot of times especially when I first started to learn how to code I would come across or meet these senior Engineers who were not so personable let's say or didn't seem to have very many other qualities other than their self-proclaimed being amazing at coding skills and what I'm seeing more and more now is because coding is becoming more accessible people are able to learn it quickly with all the resources out there even with the tools thanks to AI what's happening is people are also developing other skills they're learning how to code but they're also public speakers they're also great collab Raiders are also great Educators and what's happening is coding isn't becoming less in demand but people who possess multiple skills not just coding skills are becoming more in demand I hope that makes sense is that clear leave down below if that's clear or not I guess what I'm trying to say is coding itself isn't going anywhere it will continue to be in demand yes certain jobs with encoding will maybe fall to the side and whatnot but if you are someone who is continuing to learn an upskill you're fine as long as you're also someone who's willing to possess other skills to other human skills I think more and more as AI takes over a lot of jobs or a lot of tasks the human skills that we possess will become more important and that sounds so silly but it's really true the human skills around collaborating working together being a good team player showing up on time those are important not just to business people anymore they're important to people who are developers as well on the tech side of things and more and more we will see that collaboration happening that Gap closing closer and closer versus being able to solely rely on just one skill set or being the best at one thing or amazing at one thing but you need to now have many different things many different tools okay so Tiff you're asking yourself give me a recipe give me one two and three step one two and three what should or should I do I'm gonna tell you here yes if you're learning how to code or you're interested in coding still learn it there are so many opportunities out there for you it's expanding and growing so quickly I think sometimes we see the news or articles about all these Tech workers being laid off which is terrible but the reality is Tech is still actually one of the fastest growing Industries and it will continue to be so and Technology isn't going anywhere we're continuing to grow at such a fast pace that having the skills and understanding of coding is so important and not only that but even if you don't want to be a coder for the rest of your life being able to understand what coded does and how it works being able to speak about code in a way that other programmers can understand is so important I mean look at myself I started my career you know completely not in Tech in fashion and modeling switching into learning how to code going to a boot camp becoming a software developer for the past five plus years and then transitioning into a developer Advocate role so focused more on the community and educational side of things but if it wasn't for my understanding of code and my background of technology I wouldn't be able to do this and that continues to trickle in so many areas of my life and I'm using that example because regardless of if you can see yourself coding forever or not it's still such a great skill to learn and I think we need to start looking at coding less like uh only as a career path but more something we should all learn uh and continue to grow our skills into varying degrees I know a lot of high schools now are teaching different coding skills which is amazing and I wish I had that at my time but I didn't but yeah I think to sum it up still learn to code it's extremely in demand it really makes your resume stand out whether you want to be a developer or not and AI is not going to take over your job as long as you do continue to learn an upskill I just really don't like that quote that keeps on coming around of you know if you use AI tools then you're safe it's like not necessarily it's okay like we have to accept that AI will take over some of the smaller tasks and allowing us if we are continuing to learn an upskill to focus on larger ones so I think it's kind of like a that was way too slow it was way too slow kind of like a win-win in my opinion I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this though do you think AI will take over coder's jobs do you think it will enhance them maybe leave down in the comments and I will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]
