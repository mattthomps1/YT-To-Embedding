I don't even know where to fully start with this one where to really be in this conversation [Music] I know okay let's begin with here a disclaimer because we love disclaimers on YouTube uh no I do think they're really important let's today we're going to be talking about tech layoffs hiring phrases you've probably seen some of these articles if not heard it on the news it's everywhere you look especially in the tech world right now it can be kind of terrifying whether you are looking for a job studying or like myself working in the industry and this disclaimer is simply that this video I am making around my thoughts on hiring freezes and Tech layoffs is just exactly that it's just my thoughts so I don't want you coming here I'm not an expert on what the future will hold I do not have a crystal ball I am speaking from my experience also speaking about speaking of my experience my experience with this really started when I decided to quit my job back in the summer without having another job uh lined up at the time and just take a minute to breathe and it was during that time that I did that that a lot of these articles started surfacing and trust me I had days I had moments where I was like what did you just do Tiffany but I want to really talk about how I navigated that a lot of you've been asking questions around these topics so I'm going to cover my thoughts around them today and all right let's just jump right into it also if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related videos and if I don't answer your question in this video around this topic leave it down in the comments I always answer every single one of your questions it might take a day or two but I will get to you okay let's jump into it for a bit more context around my experience with this I it was this past summer I decided to quit my software developer job and at the time I didn't have another one lined up why I did that there was a lot of things going on behind the scenes meaning there was a family member who was dealing with some health issues I knew I wanted to take the summer to just breathe and get more into developer relations which I'm at a job now in developer relations and I love it but the point being it was a risk that I took and while I say that I want to really highlight I wouldn't have been able or wouldn't have felt comfortable taking that risk or that leap if I didn't have a financial plan lined up and what I mean by this is I knew that for X number of months or time that I could still comfortably live my life because of how I had set things up prior so it wasn't as though it was an irresponsible decision by any needs okay feel like I needed to get that out of the way just to do that disclosure because I don't want to mislead anyone through these topics now a lot of you let me pull up the questions here because I did a asked in our community tab questions you have around this one question that I got asked and it got upvoted quite a bit is is a job in text still worth pursuing if I haven't finished my studies yet should I keep studying and my opinion in that is absolutely this too shall pass yes it's not the greatest environment right now Tech is really touching every part of our future and it will continue too so pursuing a degree in it in my opinion is still extraordinarily valuable so don't let the news or the media that is pushing these headlines I mean they're pushing them to the extremes as well because of course that makes them profitable I'm not saying it isn't the reality of what's going on but just keep in mind that this too shall pass okay next question I got asked is what are important steps to take to always be prepared for an unexpected or in this case expected layoff also do you have any advice on how to deal with the stress of job insecurity okay so let's talk about part one of that question because it leads into part two so steps to take for before potentially getting laid off or preparing if you're worried about getting laid off well of course there's a financial aspect ensuring that you are putting away money in your savings that if something does happen you are able to continue to live for a while without a job as you look for a new one this is in my opinion the most important thing you need to have something to fall back on and it really goes into ensuring you are managing your money being aware of your Investments whatever you have set up that's not for me to tell you what to do but whatever you have set up make sure that you can Envision if gosh forbid something was to happen that you could survive for x amount of time while looking for a new job the other part of this is taking money aside something that I think is so important is to not get to how do I say this is to not get too comfortable with in your job you know even if you've been there for a few years I think this whole Tech layoff and hiring freeze has really reinforced that yes Tech is a cushy and high-paying industry and all this wonderful stuff but you still need to utilize skills outside of your job so meaning keep your network fresh keep on interacting with people either at your old company that you had a connection with or others you really admire in the industry keep those doors open keep that conversation open because you don't want to go to them right when you need something you want to keep that relationship ongoing this could be even just a monthly check-in on how hey how are you doing via email or LinkedIn and it's something that I still remind might have to remind myself to do because it's difficult everyone gets so busy so quickly but keeping your connections open is really important the other side of this is keeping your skills fresh so even if you have been a developer or data science whatever industry whatever role you are in keeping your skills fresh by you know either it's just doing a few interview questions on the side once in a while maybe you do an interview with another company even if you're not necessarily really looking but just to explore and practice those interview skills well maybe that's not a good idea because you really don't want to waste anyone's time let's not do that but if you go online and start practicing interview questions it's another way just to make sure you're keeping those skills fresh because that's something as well that when we get into a role yes maybe you're coding or speaking about technical topics but it might be very specific so you want to ensure that other areas of your your skill set are staying strong as well another great question our new grads are early career software engineer positions safe or can they be resigned rescinded before starting work so it varies company to company so I don't want to say yes or no but yes I've heard stories of people who have you know accepted the job offer they're ready to start and then they get an email and unfortunately they are not going to be with working for the company this is absolutely terrible and I can't imagine how that would feel um how devastating that would feel and I can see as a new grad or looking for your first job how terrifying this can feel and I think to really answer your question if you are someone who is studying currently or looking for their first job you just have to be aware of the market right now and then also kind of mentally be prepared for it meaning that it's not something you did wrong or it's not it's not personal it's just the way it is right now and rather than looking at it as beating yourself up or worried about it you just have to put yourself out there hope for the best and if it doesn't go as planned know that some that company wanted to hire you and thought you were so amazing so so many others will too it's just gonna take a bit of time so for anyone who has experiences I cannot imagine how that would feel but it's not you personally and I think that really helps when you take the the personable aspect out of it that they're not rescinding their offer because of who I am they wanted to hire me it's just because of if anything it shows more about that company unfortunately that you know there's a lot going on right now they just can't the budget doesn't allow for it so it's nothing to be really personal I know that's not a perfect answer and it just sucks at the end of the day but I really wanted to that's how I would navigate it so to sum it up yes getting a job in Tech I think is still very exciting and I think there is so much opportunity and once again going back to what I first said this too shall pass it's just kind of this wave we are in but don't let that stop you from going after what you really want you're passion about or you enjoy doing and if that is something that you are studying in Tech keep on doing it because there is still so so many opportunities out there I know for myself when I was looking for a job this past summer it was it felt like there was just so many opportunities and granted I am not someone who is just starting out in the industry so I know it's completely different but I'm telling you this to hopefully share with you that it's not as though there is no one hiring or anything like that and there is opportunity still there I think the most important thing is keeping your networking going keeping your options open and uh keeping your skills strong I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this though and I hope my perspective will help you kind of move forward I know it can be a scary time for many but we got this we have an amazing Community actually on that note if you are with a company that is hiring please leave it down in the comments and there are some amazing amazing individuals part of this community so who knows you might just find your dream job or your dream employee through this all right I hope you enjoyed this and found this perspective valuable and
