hmm I really want to become an iOS Developer and do so as quickly as possible I really want to become an Android developer yeah or what about a database engineer that'd be really cool too it came to the right place I got you covered okay let's do that one more time this is so weird I just feel like it's fun you came to the right place I got you covered hey friends today we are going to be reviewing meta's new courses when it comes to iOS development Android development and database engineering these courses will have you job ready in seven months or less we will be covering what exactly each of these roles and jobs entails what the salary expectations are and also of course reviewing these courses okay let's get into it wait before we get into it if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related content if you have questions I answer all every single question of yours or I do my best to so leave down in the comments okay now let's actually get started here foreign let's start with mobile development mobile development because honestly it's the kind of development that I really wanted to do when I first got into Tech I really haven't had much experience when it comes to Android development but iOS I definitely I would say I'm a tinkerer in I like to Tinker in in Swift and play around with it because it's so visually satisfying when you see your app on screen come to life like wow I made that people can use it it's pretty cool but with mobile development there are really two main paths that people choose from Android and iOS now your next question might be well Tiff how do I know which one to choose which one is more in demand what will be a better career long term and although it's probably not the answer you want to hear or maybe it is the real answer is they are both truly in demand and both will give you a really great career so what my recommendation is to you is play around with both iOS development and Android development and see which one resonates for you because a lot of times when people do that they automatically gravitate towards one now that being said of course there are some obvious differences when it comes to Android and iOS development with Android development you will be developing in kotlin which is a really high in demand programming language at the moment with iOS development also very highly in demand you will be working with swift before we get into each of these courses let's talk about salary as you know I oftentimes refer when it comes to salary and compensation to levels.fyi and I do this because it really is industry standards and it's extremely accurate why is so annoying okay as you can see on screen here the total compensation package the median so the average for an iOS development software engineer is around 185 000 and that is us when it comes to Android development we are looking at 174 000 us and once again this varies greatly based on company based on years of experience so as you can see they're very close paying in pay range and they're they can pretty much be the same just depending on what company you go with okay now that we have salary out of the way let's get into these courses the meat and bones the bones of meat I feel like that's that's not right let's get into the iOS course so meta's iOS course really covers from beginning if you've never even developed an iOS or worked with iOS at all to expert and job ready and how they can do that in such little time well I mean you're learning from experts in this industry so they know what to cover they know what's really important when I look at the course I can see that it starts with an introduction into mobile application development followed by Version Control I love that they cover version control because it's something that so many courses Miss and I see this really affecting people in the interview process not to mention when I went to a boot camp and then went into the interview process with very little experience when it came to Version Control and they were asked questions around it it's an area I completely flopped in so I really give them credit for including Version Control next up is the programming fundamentals in Swift and one thing when I was looking in this course and playing around with it that really stood out to me is yes of course they are focusing on the unique aspects of Swift syntax but also too they cover the fundamentals of programming in general I think it's one thing to be a developer if you know how to code in in Swift or in any language but if you understand the fundamentals of programming as a whole it will really set you apart as a developer so I think it's really great that they do that next up is principles of ux and UI design as I mentioned at the beginning of this video that's one of the things that Drew me to mobile development initially was seeing things come up on screen and just how how in depth really ux and UI is and that's something I didn't know at first was just how much thought needs to be put into it okay I'm going to be honest with you one of the things that I always look for when it comes to courses is are they really zoning in on one thing and promising you the world which will flop or are they actually you know setting you up for success and one of the things that always stands out for me in a course is if you get an Insight or get to have some learnings into the full software development life cycle and I think that's so important because it's one thing as I just mentioned too hone in on your skills and have a good understanding of it but also too if you can understand the full software development life cycle it will make you such a better developer when you are interviewing when you are working with teammates even if you want a freelance I mean it's very important if you want a freelance because you're the one doing everything and with the iOS course they also dive into react and react native and I really love that so not only are you going to be learning about Swift and you know playing around in that playground playing around that playground but you also will be learning about react and react native and that is so important because it's so in demand as well and it kind of gives you a taste of course it's react native it's not just react but it also gives you a taste into the world outside of Swift as well and I think that's really important so you can get kind of a full picture and of course to finish it off the cherry on top is a Capstone project this is great because you're really building something that you can then speak about when you are going for the interview process or networking make sure you make a portfolio or a project for your portfolio something that you're actually interested in not something that you're like yeah I guess I made this but something that has a story that the listener can actually come along along with and I know it sounds kind of cheesy but it's so true even when you're doing an interview you want to Captivate your interviewer you want them to be interested in see that you're genuinely excited in the last part of this course which I think is essential is coding interview prep and this is a final course in the program that will help prep for unique and challenging aspects of the coding interview if you are like me probably a little nervous when it comes to coding interviews they tend to not be that enjoyable I'm not trying to scare you away but they can be very tough and having the support of a course of expert Engineers of meta Engineers teaching you how to Ace the technical interview I mean I wish I had something like this when I was learning how to code all right we finished covering the iOS course not to mention I did not mention this this is a huge highlight you will walk away from this course with a certificate and I think that is a great way when you are networking especially with other meta employees maybe you want to get an interview at meta or one of the other top companies to have the certificate that you went through this program really shows your dedication to it as well all right let's move on to Android not for any reason Android and iOS they're both amazing actually I'm curious which would you prefer or do you want to learn iOS or Android or which one do you already work in and no surprise similar to iOS certification this as well starts with you know the introduction to Android mobile development then of course Version Control that's something that across really all these courses you will see is the emphasis on Version Control included in the courses which I don't want to go on about but it's such an important aspect then we work into the fundamentals in kotlin which I'm so happy they are focusing on kotlin it's completely boomed in the past few years and it just continues to Skyrocket in demand so I'm really glad that you get to focus on kotlin then similar to iOS you also will be focusing on the UI ux design side of things uh create the user interface in an Android Studio fun fact my first job when I was doing QA before I became a software developer the application I was testing in was for was an Android app or one of the apps was and I would run Android Studio on my computer at the time and it would get I honestly am surprised I didn't start a fire like it was just it was crazy hot uh and the fan was going it was just like I felt so important running the most basic tests because of like all the noise it was making anyways Android Studio it's it's an adventure after you have explored Android Studio though uh you will be learning more about software development approaches and after that one thing that Android and iOS both cover is getting back into react Basics and react native and I love that they do this as well for Android because once again it really sets you apart having more skill sets then of course you will be doing your Capstone project as well as coding interview prep now Tiff you might be asking well should I take one the iOS one or the Android or should I take both and my answer to you is it really depends I would suggest focusing on one achieving that and then seeing how you are feeling you definitely can take both and it will also of course add to your resume but it's also not necessary okay let's talk a little bit about database engineering well before we get into it what exactly is a database engineer let's go to Google our our trusted Source because I'm scared if I'm going to tell you something that's wrong I just it's too too risky what does a database engineer do database Engineers create and maintain databases okay well yeah that makes sense they design the database engine processes for sorting and accessing information so they use programming knowledge to build data pipelines and integrate new information into existing databases and this is actually it would be a really fun job I for my first job as a software developer I worked a lot with databases and it was so fun because I mean it depends on what language you are working in or what you are working with but for myself for example I was uh working with mySQL and it was so cool to see for my first time writing queries and how they're kind of singular similar to English but they're so different you feel like you're writing this like secret language I don't know maybe that's me nerding out but I think this would be a really great job okay let's jump into this course so as all the courses in this it's taught by meta uh one thing that stands out for me right away is of course that they teach mySQL database management data creation querying and manipulation so similar to what I was just saying they also teach you how to code and use Python syntax and how to prepare for technical interviews for database engineered roles and I really like that because there's not a lot of database engineering courses out there that I'm familiar with anyways and it's really great as well that they have in the preparation for technical interview Parts because yeah the resources are not as as much as I would say the other two we spoke about okay introduction to database yes that's amazing Version Control we know that's with all of them database structures and management with mySQL this is a great way I really like how they added this in first because my sequel is pretty user friendly it can get complex fast but pretty friendly to learn with first so I really like that that's kind of your first introduction into this and then it goes into advanced MySQL topics uh which is a great way to continue to grow and then they go into programming in Python which is I mean python is a great language it's so in demand that the fact you're learning python in this I think is a huge plus as well and you're probably wondering well I understand I can visually picture what it would look like for a Capstone project for iOS or Android but what about for a database engineer so for this Capstone project it's a really great idea what they do is you'll demonstrate your new skill set by designing and composing a database solution so this is something that I really think especially with this course will really help you stand out because I just I've never seen courses like this before especially for database engineers and I think this is a really great way to go then of course there is as I mentioned the coding interview preparation finally for all of these courses I listed once you complete one of them or all of them depending on your level of eagerness you will get access to the meta career programs job board so what this means is it's essentially I think it's around 200 employers that have committed to sourcing Talent through meta certificate program so they are looking for specifically people who have completed these programs which is I mean it's a win-win I don't know what what more you would need as far as a straight path into meta and it's a great way to network with employers they want you to succeed and they want to hire you so this is something you will get once you have completed a course and okay the next question is well how long am I going to have to dedicate to this well for example if you were to do approximately seven hours a week which is an hour a day which really is nothing the program will take approximately eight months to complete and that varies program to program but that's on average so of course if there's some keeners out there you can do that even faster and it's crazy to think your life your career your income everything could be transformed in under a year or just over six months okay we have oh I got my hair in there we have reviewed the three courses I was so excited to review meta's new courses because I did a review a while ago on some of them and I truly believe in them I got so many messages from you who have taken them and uh it's really transformed your career so I was super excited to sit down and go through these today if you have any other questions around it though leave down in the comments and as I mentioned I will make sure to answer every single one of them thank you all for watching this video make sure to hit that subscribe button and I will see you soon thanks everyone thank you [Music]
