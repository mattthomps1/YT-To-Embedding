[Music] okay I'm gonna be the one to break really bad news to you there are things that some of you are learning and studying and working with right now in technology that is going to stop being in demand very soon soon that we probably expect and this isn't to scare you or to worry you about the future and do you have a future but to equip you with if you are headed in a direction where you are focused on technology and skills that might not be in demand in the near future how to kind of shift your gears and focus on skills that will be in demand let's get into it [Music] the first one being single language development so what do I mean by this if you are a developer learning how to code or really any technology understanding just that Soul language or that Soul technology isn't going to become In Demand anymore now this might not become necessarily obsolete but it definitely isn't going to be what stands out to someone or gets you hired now there's difference here being a specialist at something and really diving into understanding a subject whether it be a programming language whether it be a specific technology that's a different topic what I'm talking about is not being open to learn other languages to learn other Technologies as they come up we're living in a time now where even if you want to get hired as a developer you need to know maybe one programming language with multiple Frameworks with a framework you need to know multiple Technologies at the end of the day gone are the days where it's good enough to just know I know python or I know JavaScript you need to have a bit more willingness to learn new technologies as they arise and as we know they are coming quickly the next one on the list one that is a kind of sad reality for a lot of people who relied just on their hard skills meaning technical skills is hard skills without technical skills is kind of becoming obsolete nowadays if you really want to be in demand and get high layered with a nice salary grow your career you can't just have your technical skills even if your heart getting hired for a technical role and I know this is a hard Truth for a lot of us to hear but gone are those days nowadays when you are getting hired you even if it's for a technical role you need to have the soft skills that go alongside it you need to communicate with a team you need to be collaborative you need to be able to present some soft skills as well now I'm not saying you have to be this amazing speaker or have a ton of different soft skills but being willing to work together work in a team-like setting versus gone are the days where you can just go in your basement program and you know still be super in demand those days are coming becoming less and less and the reality is hard skills without soft skills is no longer something that is in demand okay let's go into some other roles that this article on Forbes is saying will become less in demand actually they're saying obsolete the first one being quality assurance now I don't really fully agree with this I think quality assurance will remain a job that is needed for quite a long time however you do see it shifting to a different kind of role meaning if you look at the article here which I will pull up on screen you can see generally quality assurance roles are being actively merged with developer roles which I agree with nowadays when you are a developer a lot of your responsibility before you even submit a PR you you know you are expected to write tests you're expected to test your software test your code to make sure it functions accordingly now that being said a lot of times as a developer you are biased or I'll speak for myself anyways and if I kind of see a bug but I'm really tired of working on that ticket let it slide and that's where QA comes in so I do think QA will remain in demand to a degree but I don't think it's going up in demand let's say that another one here on the Forbes article that they list is systems Administration and I needed a second to really understand what they were referring to with this as far as how it would become obsolete so they are arguing that with the cloud and software as a service becoming normalized software delivery Platforms in businesses the need for administrators and system experts is lessened they go on to say well technical support will continue to be a growing field high level admins who operate Within These systems themselves will need to shift to other areas and I kind of agree with this I don't think it's going to become obsolete maybe tomorrow but it's definitely not coming in further in demand and another one this article says will not be in demand or actually they say obsolete again is single software expertise and this is something we spoke about a bit earlier in this video and it's something that I agree with no longer can you be an expert in just one software well sorry let me rephrase that yes of course you can but is it going to be in demand will it continue to grow in your career probably not you need to be open to learning these new softwares new programs that come out even if you're not a developer but not being scared of touching technology working with programs even if you're a project manager being able to use different tools as they come up that are more in demand or more popular and being open-minded essentially or a forever learner is going to be so key so this brings us to the question these rules that we're talking about or these skills we're talking about are becoming less and less in demand how do you ensure that what you are doing the skills that you have will stay in demand that you are actually on a direction that will continue to grow and not become obsolete I think the trend that I'm hoping you see throughout this entire video is you just need to be open-minded and a forever learner and I keep on saying that I know it probably sounds cliche after a while but it's so true jobs are going to continue to change as AI continues to evolve and grow and a lot of the jobs we see today we will not have in the future and that's okay it doesn't need to be something we're scared of or worried about rather excited about and look at it as a positive that frankly We're All in This Together it doesn't just affect Tech roles it affects you know for example even with chat gbt you hear stories now of how it can pass the bar exam it can do all these different things in all of these different areas it's not just technology and I think that's really important to note too it makes me feel a bit better when I sleep at night knowing that if my job's taking over probably everyone else's job's taken over too and we've already moved on to figuring out a new way of life maybe it involves it's not working at all on that note of dreamy if not working ever again AI is doing everything for us I don't know let me know down below other comments or other ideas of you that you have or you see trends of of skills that are not near as in demand as they used to be in Tech or maybe they are on the way of becoming obsolete it doesn't have to be negative it has to be something we are aware of and take action on thank you all for watching and I will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music] foreign [Music]
