why is coding so hard to learn and does it 
get easier all these amazing engineering   leaders seem to have it all figured out are 
they just Geniuses or what is the secret   today oh geez okay let's just you know today 
I'm going to be covering with you why exactly   when you are first learning how to code it 
can feel so difficult so challenging and of   course learning anything new comes with a lot 
of challenges but for some reason when we are   learning how to code whether it be your first 
programming language or even if you've been a   software engineer for quite some time I mean 
it definitely gets easier with time there is   hope for you that is just starting out but why 
is it so hard to grasp and I want to share with   you today my thoughts around it okay also can you 
believe in literally less than one week less than   one week actually in a few days the interact 
conference is happening which I am so excited   about I'm curious to know who has signed up for 
it as you know it's a completely free virtual   conference that is happening on October 25th this 
is a conference I went to last year and I still   keep in touch with a lot of the speakers that were 
there they are engineering leaders they have some   amazing advice to give I felt like I took away 
from the conference a lot of insight a lot of   knowledge but honestly most importantly in my 
opinion is a lot of inspiration in how I can   grow my career so whether you are just starting 
out in your Tech Career or you are an engineering   leader yourself there is so much value that 
you will gain from this conference some of the   panel topics include connecting your Dev teams 
work to the business bottom line being a leader   in uncertain times how to treat devs like human 
beings and the science of building products for   emerging Industries also you know we all love this 
part of conferences which is giveaways there are   going to be a ton of different giveaways here lots 
of prizes and also too there's going to be a live   event chat so you can connect with others that 
are attending the conference or other speakers and   make sure to come say hi to me there are going to 
be some incredible engineering leaders speaking at   this event some of them include ruckmany Reddy who 
is the SVP of platform engineering Smooty Patel   who is the head of engineering and charity Majors 
who is the CTO and co-founder now this is just   listing a few there are so many others that you 
can connect with which is really exciting so if   you haven't already click the link down below my 
bio it's completely free happening in a few days   and leave a comment if you will be attending so I 
can look out for you okay let's get back into it   okay we are back now back in action and it's way 
more peaceful and quiet just the way I like it   let's get back to it though why is coding so hard 
to learn I want to share with you a little story   on this when I first started learning how to 
code there are really different I discovered   there are different kind of waves you go through 
throughout the learning to code process at first   there's this Terror there's a sphere am I going 
to be able to do it and you question yourself a   lot then comes this almost honeymoon phase where 
you're taking coding tutorials you're like wow   this is amazing thinking of all the projects 
you can build how you are going to be the next   Mark Zuckerberg and just take over the world 
and it's just like this euphoric moment when   you first start learning to code and are taking 
tutorials and everything's going pretty smoothly   you're telling your friends about it and they're 
all really impressed that you're gonna be a coder   it's really cool and then you think you know 
what I've taken a few coding tutorials let me try   building something on my own this is where that 
that Peak hits of that honeymoon and you start   going downhill very quickly meaning you start 
building a project on your own and you quickly   realize that wow this is a lot harder than when 
I was following a tutorial and it's one of those   things that you realize I don't know as much as I 
thought I did so then you start Google searching   searching for other topics searching for other 
ideas maybe you even end up in what is called maybe you even end up in what is known as tutorial 
hell which essentially is you just keep on doing   tutorial after tutorial this point usually 
comes after the honeymoon phase when you should   be focusing on building your own projects but you 
just have that fear of the what if and the unknown   and maybe you've even tried to build projects on 
your own and just gone in stock and didn't know   where to go long story short there is definitely 
highs and lows and very high highs and very low   lows when you are learning to code the funny thing 
is it's not just when you are starting to learn to   code it does get better as you get more experience 
because you have the toolkit to learn new things   and learn them quicker however there definitely is 
times where you will still face imposter syndrome   even 10 20 years in and you pick up something new 
it's way easier because you had that toolkit but   you still have those feelings so going back to it 
why is coding so hard to learn I'm going to break   it down to you as far as some of the reasons 
behind why is the first one is it's a new way   of thinking for many people and I can attest to 
myself who didn't pay attention in high school   really to math or Sciences I just didn't seem 
quote unquote cool at the time now I wish I did   and no one really pushed me to so in turn I didn't 
have to I didn't have that side of my brain that   logic side of my brain that is used in programming 
that wasn't a strong suit of mine to begin with so   as much as I was learning how to code I was 
also learning how to think in a new way how   to problem solve in a new way and I think that is 
something that a lot of people discover when they   are starting out in their coding journey is that 
this is a whole new way of thinking and problem   solving another thing that happens way more often 
than not is that feeling of overwhelmed kind of   like I am in this rain right now trying to walk 
the dogs but when you start learning to code or   learning something new in Tech the first thing you 
will quickly realize is there is a lot to learn   there are so many resources out there so much out 
there and it's overwhelming for me I remember I   would start learning you know react and then view 
came out and I was like or it was the hot thing   at the time it's like oh my gosh I need a switch 
and you know then something else came out and it's   that feeling that you're never learning enough and 
you are first of all learning enough it's just you   need to take it day by day and I think one of 
the most important things is whatever you pick   just stick to it until you feel pretty proficient 
in it it's easy to jump around and then in turn   not really learn anything okay another reason why 
coding can be really difficult to learn is coding   is hard to teach and a lot of times you will be 
taking coding tutorials and maybe you really look   up to these people but they're not teaching it 
in the best way possible let me rewind that a bit   maybe they're teaching it in the best way possible 
but not in the way that works best for you and I   think half the battle is really finding someone an 
instructor or a mentor that can speak the way you   understand if that makes sense everyone learns so 
differently some more visually than others and at   first it takes a while getting used to what works 
best for you for example for me when I started I   completely ignored the documentation I was more a 
visual person I wanted to see tutorials see things   moving on screen and I do not recommend at all 
ignoring the documentation that came to bite me   in the butt later on but the point is whatever 
way that works best for you to start learning   do that even if it might not be the quote-unquote 
correct way or the way people are suggesting   sometimes in order just to start something new 
you need to do what you are comfortable with or   what you know works best for you and if you don't 
know what works best for you that's also a part of   the reason I think that a lot of people struggle 
with learning to code is because they're learning   how to learn which sounds kind of funny but it 
really is a skill in itself another thing that   happens more often than not is we learn too fast 
when you go online you see all these articles of   how I became a full stack engineer in you know 
two months or how I landed my first job in two   weeks or I don't know just ridiculous things like 
that and it puts subconsciously a lot of pressure   on ourselves that we need to learn everything so 
quickly but what that really does is we end up not   learning anything because we don't learn anything 
well another thing that really didn't work well   for me when I was first learning and still to this 
day I need to have I'm someone who needs to have   support and everyone's different a lot of people 
I've seen some incredible programmers who are   self-taught and never had to ask another human 
a question but just you know went on stackable   they asked another human but they just went on 
stack Overflow and asked that way I am someone   who gives me all of the support you got let me 
you know take all your advice and insight and   when I was learning to code I actually hired a 
mentor I hired someone a tutor to sit down with   me once a week I was building a react project and 
I was actually working at the time as a software   developer very early on in my career but I was 
still learning react I was working more in the   back end side of things and I was like I just want 
someone who is an expert in the front end expert   with react to sit down with me once a week and 
just like soak up all their knowledge now maybe   this isn't feasible for you know some people 
I'm not saying to have to you have to go and   spend your money on a mentor or a tutor for me 
it was completely an amazing investment because   I learned so quickly so much information because 
I was able to have that one-on-one with someone   who's an expert all right let's talk about it 
you know it's coming this word that's so overused   imposters but it's true it really can slow down 
your learning A lot of times we question are we   good enough are we worth it am I skilled enough 
to learn this new thing and it can really slow   down your learning to the point where it almost 
freezes you that you stop learning for a while   because you think maybe this isn't for me this 
is for you if you want it and it takes time as   I mentioned earlier it takes a lot of time and 
it's one of those things that you just have to   keep on repeating it's like a muscle I always say 
the more you practice the stronger you will get   okay those are some things that I think really 
some insights into what makes coding difficult   to learn but at the end of the day it's one of 
those things that I really believe anyone can   do it and maybe to varying degrees depending 
on your background and things but at least   learn the basics build some really interesting 
projects and get a lot of value out of it also   if you haven't already hit that subscribe button 
show me some love and support I love you all so   much and genuinely I am so passionate about 
making videos to help you and on that note if   there are videos you want me to cover topics 
you want me to cover leave in the comments   it's how I get my my ideas of what you want to 
see and I'll see you all soon thanks everyone
