okay when I was first getting into Tech a term that was so difficult for me to wrap my head around was continuous integration and continuous deployment CI CD so I'm going to explain to you in very simple terms what it is in a way I wish someone would have just explained it to me it let's use a real world example to start with so say you want to make something with Legos but before you share it with your friends or your family you want to make sure it's really perfect it's kind of what CI CD does for software development when you are making changes in your code base the ICD will check that these changes don't break the rest of the code base or the program and that it works well with everything else so in simple terms every time a developer makes changes to a code base the code that code is automatically integrated with the rest of the code base and then tests are done to make sure the new code doesn't break any of the existing functionality and if all those tests pass then this code is now deployed to the staging environment where more tests are run then typically if those tests pass and the code meets requirement it's deployed to production save this for your next tech interview
