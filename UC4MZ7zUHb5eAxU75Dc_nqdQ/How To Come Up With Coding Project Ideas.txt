okay I have a confession for you I get asked a lot around where to come up with ideas for coding projects where to find inspiration for coding projects and a lot of the times I just say well just think about things you're interested in it should be that simple this kind of came to bite me in the butt and what I mean by that is recently I've been thinking of different side projects for myself to work on projects that I can share with you as well and I'm struggling I understand the question now where does inspiration come from where do you find ideas for projects to build that you're really interested in so as much as I am making this video for you this video is for me as well and I've really taken time to do research on it of where do you find ideas around different coding projects and for this I'm going to break it down into sections that I've been recently looking into to really find inspiration to build projects that I'm passionate about a little bit of background on me before we dive into it I've been a software developer for five plus years now I started self-teaching went to a coding boot camp and recently took on a role in the developer relations space which I am loving merging both the technical side with the communications and education side of things so it's really really cool to be able to do but with that I've been learning a lot of new technologies recently one for me has been next.js and I've been wanting to build projects with it things that I'm actually passionate about and interested in because it makes a project a lot more fun to do okay let's just get right into it but before we do make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and career related videos leave in the comments any questions you have around this or really anything and I always respond to every single question of yours or I do my best to and this is how the videos come out is based on questions that you have okay enough of me talking let's get into it foreign as I mentioned I'm going to break these down into different kind of subcategories where I'm finding inspiration for projects and the first one no surprise here is something I've spoken about a bit before which is finding inspiration through your hobbies and if you don't have a hobby go and get one you cannot have your whole world of revolve around Tech or your career hobbies are really important and it doesn't have to be this crazy hobby it could be a hobby that you're really interested in collecting cards or okay I'm not gonna list random Hobbies here it's going to fail miserably but anything really that you have an interest in so for me I don't have a hobby in the sense that I don't sit at home and knit or um you know I'm not a baker or anything like that but I do definitely love to I love fashion I love to work out I love healthy eating and so those aren't necessarily Hobbies but they are things I'm really passionate about and I consider a hobby in the sense that with working out you know I do it regularly and I'm always kind of like looking at different fashion trends anyways you get the point it doesn't have to be a direct hobby but something you're really interested in and take that and utilize that into a project okay so then it brings up the question or a question that I faced anyways is so what I still have no inspiration in this and that's something that I've really found recently and one thing that helped me kind of come out of this rut is something I spoke about actually in a recent video which was rapid API rapid API yeah and just like the last one I'm giving a lot of free press here uh just like the last one um this isn't sponsored by them or anything I just kind of am obsessed with them because it's lists so many incredible apis that you can play around with and what I've started to do is structure projects around those apis so for example in my last video actually I did a build a Chrome extension with me and we used an API from Rapid API that was a concert API and I I was sifting through the apis and I saw I'm like this is so cool I can utilize this and make it into a project and really build out your project that way so I started working backwards as far as finding things I'm interested in with my hobbies my interests finding apis that relate to it and reading about the apis through the documentation seeing what others have built and through that finding a lot of inspiration to build small projects all right the next way I've been finding kind of inspiration or ideas around creating projects is playing make-believe and hear me out on this one this is something I actually did early on when I was building my first developer portfolio which is playing make believe meaning I would build projects for people who didn't ask for it and probably didn't need one take I wish I still had it but I don't think I do was one project I built was for my dad and he had a construction company so I built him a website with his logo and I put some houses on there that he has built some information it was terrible but he was so kind about it but it was oh it was bad this is why I don't have it anymore but the point of that being even if someone in your family or friend doesn't need a website at the moment or an app or whatever it is that you are specializing in you can still build something for them and you don't have to consult them on that or even talk to them about it but just be like hmm you know my mom loves baking what if I made her a website that featured all of her you know baking items contact information and start thinking humid that way like she's almost a client and that does two things especially if you are early on in your career your Development Career it really shows that you're taking initiative it looks like you're taking on clients they don't know it's your mom they don't know who this person is that you built the website for so that's another great way as well the third thing that I've been really finding inspiration in is through games I've been tinkering around a lot with python and if you follow me on Tick Tock or other socials you've probably seen me making different projects with python and it's just a really fun language to to make quick and fun projects with and for me I've been really enjoying finding different games especially retro games to build with it so that's another idea as well I know react of course a very popular one is to do the X's and O's game or you can make a chess game there's the games are pretty much unlimited whatever your favorite game is Hangman's another popular one that's really fun and you just make a game whether you play it or not that's not the point but pick a favorite game of yours and build it another thing that is really an interesting way to make projects is to what is the word be like an artist reflect like an artist I'm using the wrong term but the point is be inspired by other people I think it's like steal like an artist that's what it is feel like an artist meaning it's totally fine to take inspiration from others who have built these really great projects I mean maybe don't duplicate them per se but if you see someone building something really awesome why not be like hey I'm really inspired by this these are the portions of it that I really like why don't I build my own project in a different way with my own language but something similar and this isn't copying someone else's project this isn't claiming that you know their project is yours but what it is doing is finding inspiration through others this is done all the time in music in fashion in cooking in every single industry so it's definitely done as well in the tech world and if you have someone you really look up to or admire look at their projects what they're building and see if you can find inspiration through that the last thing that I've been doing a lot and once again if you if you watch my short form videos you will see a lot of these is solving real world problems and this is currently my favorite thing to do I get really passionate quickly about this because it's so fun so for example I a while back I built a react app and I was going to build it out as a purpose-wide built it in react uh that was a taking a food API and randomizing the results so every time I clicked on a button it would output a different type of food and what this would do is tell me what kind of takeout I should order that night because ordering food is so difficult getting deciding on what you want to eat is impossible so I was like let the code do it for me that video is now at 2 million views which is crazy but it just goes to show how fun it can be to build solutions for real life problems and whether it be something that orders food for you whether it be picking out your outfits uh different recipes to cook with different drinks to make the list is endless but it's a really great way to get very invested in a project because you know you will use it afterwards it's something that actually solves a real world problem okay I can hear my dogs in the background they're shaking out meaning they want to eat I hope this video was really helpful and valuable to you though on providing inspiration or places to look for inspiration on different projects to make and I can completely relate and have a lot of empathy right now for people who are struggling to find projects to make or ideas to have because for the longest time I was super inspired and I didn't have this problem and it was recent I've been like where where is this inspiration going to come from so these are the ways that I am looking for them and finding inspiration and I hope you do too and on that note I'm going to be sharing more of my projects on my GitHub Tiffin Tech it's I created it only a few months ago because my old one had projects on there since I like started which was they were just they were terrible but I probably should have left it up because it shows progress over years and years and years that being said it just it was not going to be in a public I was not putting it out in the world but yeah so follow me on GitHub if you want to see more of the project I'm creating link down your githubs down below I'd love to see what you are working on and if you haven't hit that subscribe button I'll see you soon thanks everyone [Music]
