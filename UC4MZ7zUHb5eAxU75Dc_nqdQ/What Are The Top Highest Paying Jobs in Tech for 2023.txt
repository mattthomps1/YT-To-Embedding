did you know that Tech employees can make up to 85 
percent more than employees in other Industries I   know when I first heard the stat I was pretty much 
mind blown now let's back up a sec the stat also   is dependent on different locations so if you are 
in you know middle of America versus if you are   in San Francisco this debt will vary and it will 
change but I still think it's very interesting   to think about in this video we are going to be 
speaking about some of the top highest paying   tech jobs for 2023 and I thought this was a 
very interesting video to film and research   about because Tech right now no surprise to many 
of us is in a very strange Place let's say strange   Place meaning there's a lot of hiring freezes 
going on there's a lot of layoffs going on so   why would you even consider pursuing a career in 
Tech a lot of people are asking and then there's   others who are already in Tech wondering is my 
job is my role valuable enough to the company   that they will keep me and this got me thinking 
what is the research saying what are the stats   saying regarding what are the highest demand 
jobs or roles in Tech and does this align to for   me personally where I'm at and I'm sure if you're 
watching this video you are curious as to digital   line with where you're at now I want to know I'm 
going to go through the top in demand highest   paying jobs in tech for 2023 but there is still 
some that I'm not going to list that of course   are still high in demand there's I mean this video 
can only be so long but I just wanted to note that   foreign there is no surprise here this made 
on the list which is data scientist in simple   terms what exactly does a data scientist do 
a data scientist's job is to analyze data for   actionable insights so specific tasks that include 
identifying data analytics problems that offer the   greatest opportunities to the organization now 
the next question you might be asking is well   what are some skills and requirements to become a 
data scientist first off I want to say for a lot   of these rules you don't need to go back to school 
to get a degree to get a master's but rather a lot   of them can be through self-study through going to 
different programs so I really wanted to highlight   that because I think it's one of the coolest 
things about tech and what it has to offer is   there are so many ways to get into the industry so 
some skills and requirements for a data scientist   often include the knowledge of R python or other 
database programming languages you need to have   experience or an understanding at least in 
statistical analysis and pattern recognition   so what are some primary duties well actually I 
was speaking to a data scientist in my talk Tech   with Tiff series and one thing that I really love 
she highlighted is that it's not just she said it   really well she's like I don't just sit there and 
look at data or analyze data or code all day but   I actually have to talk to the stakeholders I have 
to present this data to them as well so it's a job   that I think a lot of people would find surprising 
to say it's not just you speaking to the computer   but you also are speaking to stakeholders as well 
which I really like so it's kind of The Best of   Both Worlds you still get to work on your soft 
skills and improve those while also working on   your technical skills so primary duties include 
analyzing sorting and sanitizing data to yield   actionable actionable I can't speak today sorry 
it's okay to you actionable or meaningful results   also find better ways of collecting data to get 
meaningful information and create reports that   are human friendly and readable kind of going 
back to presenting this to the stakeholders now   what let's get to the most important part how much 
does a data scientist make now I just want to give   a little side note here these numbers this total 
compensation that I am doing is just at its total   compensation so it's base it's Equity it's stock 
Etc and I'm referencing them from levels FYI I'll   link it down below they have a ton of different 
roles I'm on there right now and based from a   ton of different locations levels of your career 
Etc so for data scientists the medium this means   if you're taking into account the Juniors as well 
the very high seniors as well but on average it's   around 125 000. so you can see how as this 
is the medium as you grow in your career it   will go quite higher than this and also too as 
you're starting on your career you can still   expect a great salary to begin with now next 
on the list is cloud architect and once again   I'm sure this is not surprising to many of you 
a cloud architect puts an organization's cloud   computing strategy into action so they come up 
with a strategy and then also to implement it   okay I'm on vacation as you know and it's getting 
a little noisy outside let's go back inside okay   this is what happens when you go on vacation and 
decide to continue to work you gotta get creative   especially when it comes to filming but anyways 
next on the list as I was mentioning is cloud   architect a cloud architect designs optimizes 
and analyzes Cloud networks the stats for cloud   and the jobs that are in demand for cloud 
is skyrocketing let me actually check it out   because I'm not sure the exact stats Cloud across 
just the industry itself because I was thinking   of specializing in the cloud at one point and I 
kind of still am I think it's really interesting um cloud services is to is forecast to grow 
20 in 2022 yeah the stats around it is just   crazy like it's continuing to grow and grow so 
although I'm speaking about Cloud architect I   think any job within the cloud is such a 
great way to go it's so interesting and   I always say that I always think to myself that 
it would be either Cloud for me or web3 and maybe   you know those two intertwined but I think it's 
interesting just to see those two industries   really growing okay back to Cloud architect as 
we were saying some skills and requirements for   a cloud architect include extensive knowledge of 
cloud infrastructure and Cloud architecture you   also have to be competent in programming knowing 
python JavaScript and you also have to have   knowledge in Cloud infrastructures platforms and 
applications also for this role in the architect   role you have to have soft skills in communication 
people skills leadership skills because you will   be working with clients as well so some duties and 
this can vary based on company include evaluating   an organization's Cloud network monitoring Cloud 
security and privacy and proactively reacting to   potential threats and creating and maintaining 
a comprehensive Cloud strategy now when I said   you might be working with clients because 
sometimes especially in a Consulting world   you will be Consulting other businesses and their 
Cloud strategy or their how their architecture   looks so it can go both ways as well okay let's 
get to the good part the money part for this one   it's not on levels FYI so I actually just typed 
it in and found from salary.com so it's a range   in the US from 143 000 to 165 000. so I think 
that number definitely can go up especially when   you start talking about total compensation as 
well because I believe this is just salary just   based salary yeah I believe this is base salary 
uh but yeah so it does definitely go up when you   start talking about equity and stocks as well 
next on the list is blockchain engineer and I'm   sure you've seen news articles on this or read 
articles or blog posts online on just how well   paid these blockchain Engineers are and how in 
demand they are now my next thing I get asked a   lot is well Tiff they're so high in demand how 
do I become one and I had this question too as   a developer as an engineer how do you get into 
the blockchain world and the good news is if   you're already a developer or software engineer 
the path to becoming a blockchain engineer is   much more there's less hurdles you will have to 
overcome versus if you are just starting out and   that is because you already know programming you 
think like a programmer you are a programmer so in   order to learn uh to become a blockchain developer 
you really just need to level up your skills focus   in on that area which I think is really exciting 
uh because it's not something that you have to   go back to school for for another four years 
or anything like that and even if you aren't   a developer already but you want to become one it 
definitely is a great path that you can focus on   as well also as a side note if you are looking to 
learn more about web3 and building web 3 I am this   isn't a sponsored anything but I am a huge fan 
of buildspace.so and it just has I'll put up on   screen here because it has some amazing resources 
to build different products and also too it has   a huge community so that is just a little side 
tip from me do you okay let's talk about salary   for blockchain engineers this one is a tough one 
because it still is pretty new that I find there   is so much when I was researching this there's 
so much research out there that varies so when   I was speaking to some friends who are in the 
industry who focus on blockchain engineering   they kind of helped me come up with an accurate or 
more so accurate uh range so what I did was when I   was searching blockchain engineer initially I 
came across this article on hired.com and the   salaries of candidates typically range from on the 
low side 150 000 to on the high side 200 000. so   the medium would be around 180 000 and from what 
I have spoken to in the industry this is pretty   accurate so that's a really high paying job if you 
ask me and you get to build really cool Tech next   on the list is devops engineer devops engineer is 
something a role that I feel like is often hidden   or within the company isn't spoke about as much 
as it should be this is like the star of the show   in the back end and running so many things making 
sure everything's functioning okay yet it doesn't   get the recognition in my opinion that it really 
deserves so if you are a devops engineer you are   the star of the show in my opinion okay but what 
exactly is a devops engineer for those of you who   might not be as familiar with it essentially a 
devops engineer is kind of what I just summed   it up to be they are responsible to ensure smooth 
operation for the company's I.T infrastructure so   they work with developers to deploy and manage 
code changes operation staff to ensure systems   are up and running smoothly they work with a 
few different departments but at the end of   the day their priority is to make everything 
is smooth it's peaceful and to be successful   in a devops career you not only need to have 
a strong understanding of development but also   to operational processes some of the skills for 
devops engineer they need coding they also need   to be able to write scripts and knowing how 
to set up and run a network git and Jenkins   now the average yearly salary we have this on 
levels FYI let's look it up for devops okay so   devops can make a lot of money I have one here 
after eight years in the industry at instacart   apparently this is according to levels fii 
that the total comp is 250 000 U.S which that's um okay so more accurately though actually that 
is accurate but what I mean is the medium would   be closer to let's see here for a median salary 
not total compensation for devops it's around 140   000 us per year last but definitely not least 
on the list is cyber security and this I'm going   to speak about a cyber security engineer but I 
really want to highlight cyber security as a whole   it needs so much more people in the industry 
so even if you are not an engineer this in part   this uh niche in the industry of cyber security 
is so in demand it's continuing to grow there's   no it's not going to slow down and you don't need 
to be an engineer to work in cyber security they   need product managers they need everything that 
everyone else does in the tech industry they need   but you just need to have a strong understanding 
of what cyber security is and the good thing is   that's all available online that you can take 
courses you can read up on it but it's a very   growing industry now let's get back to cyber 
security engineer cyber security Engineers are   in charge of security functions that can include 
designing developing and implementing High   securely Network Solutions this also sometimes 
can include good hacking which essentially is you   are hacking into your own company's applications 
to see where the vulnerabilities lie it's a very   interesting career and I had a good friend 
of mine who is a cyber security engineer and   getting to hear her stories not only about 
the the apps she was testing at work too   but external ones and what's kind of going on 
behind the scenes it was really exciting but   it also is very terrifying just how vulnerable 
I think a lot of applications are some other   responsibilities for cyber security Engineers 
can include penetration testing so this means   evaluating an organization's computer networks 
applications and data systems for vulnerability   so pretty much what I just said also to network 
maintenance so you might need to install test and   configure some networks and I.T system security 
so spending time defining protocols and installing   and configuring security devices okay that's a 
lot so you can see it's a very diverse job in   the sense that you get to work on a lot of very 
interesting problems now what is with such an   important uh job what is the salary for this okay 
for this I went on ZipRecruiter and I can see here   they say for salary not total compensation and I 
always really highlight those differences because   it's easy to get the two uh mixed up when you 
were speaking to people or speaking to friends   or whoever you're speaking to and I want to 
really highlight this because a lot of times if   someone says oh I make 250 000 a year you need 
to clarify okay that's great but is that total   comp or is that base salary because that's a big 
difference so that's why I always try and do that   in these videos is ensure I am clarifying what 
I'm speaking to so this is for base salary and   the average national average is around 120 000 U.S 
so this definitely can go up extremely as you grow   in your cyber security career but also too you are 
starting with a very not 120 000 typically but you   are starting with a very good salary as well okay 
those are some of the top in-demand jobs or fields   in the tech industry that are going to continue to 
really grow in 2023 and I'm really excited to see   where they go because a lot of these industries 
or Fields I guess you could say within the tech   industry are just at the tip just starting out 
when you think about cyber security when you think   about blockchain these fields yes they've been 
around for a while but they have so much potential   and they're going to unlock so many other things 
that being a part of that is really exciting I'm   curious to know what specific field in Tech are 
you working in or are you passionate about or   want to get in leave down in the comments okay 
the sun is calling me I can see it from behind   you I need to go relax on a chair now thank you
