your mind is going to be blown when we start 
talking about some of the jobs that don't exist   today but will in the future now these are 
jobs that you might think oh that will never   happen in my lifetime or oh that is so far out 
from the future as we've seen even since the   release of chat GPT how many more AI generated 
tools have come out how far we have gotten with   media and video and generated art coming out 
it's going to be in your lifetime or if not   in your lifetime very close after in my opinion 
maybe I'm an opportunity no what is the word an   optimist thinking that Tech is evolving but Tech 
is according to research evolving at a very quick   rate quicker than it was even a few years ago and 
that is continuing to speed up so naturally I'm   curious to hear if you think these jobs will be 
around in our lifetime your lifetime my lifetime   depending on the age these are some future jobs 
that are speculative of course and I got them   through talking to chat GPT through looking online 
and just hearing what some experts are saying   let's jump into it oh if you haven't already 
hit that subscribe button give this video a like   comment down below what are some of the wildest 
jobs that don't exist today that you think will   in the future let's get into it foreign first on 
the list is cyber security human security officer   why would cyber security need human officers or 
human Chief officers well for the reason of as we   become closer to more implants more chips getting 
used in humans we will need someone to maintain   that and ensure things don't go well frankly 
sideways having a cyber security specialist for   human humans that have chips in them or different 
Tools in them is going to be needed because the   reality is with this also comes the ability for 
hackers to hack into humans this sounds so strange   as I say it out loud but yes this is something 
that might potentially be needed in the future   if we end up going the way that Elon Musk and 
others are really pushing for with implanting   chips in our brain once again I feel like I'm such 
a crazy person for making this video but it's so   fascinating thinking about what the implications 
are what the pros are so many Pros having access   to AI information right in our brains and 24 7. 
I'm sure there'll be more Geniuses so many more   Innovations but on the flip side it does come 
with the risk of having technology part of us   and the ability to be hack cyber security human 
specialist officer that is a title next up is one   that if you've watched my short form videos you've 
heard me talk about which is space tourism guide   this one gets me really excited I'd love to be a 
space tourism guide with different companies like   SpaceX and blue origin making specifically really 
large improvements in the world of space when it   comes to getting normal citizens to be able to 
go into space and putting normal citizens into   space that will continue to grow and evolve at a 
quick rate and now this isn't something that's the   future this is happening now but having a tourism 
guide where you can imagine people are loading   onto spacecraft going into space and the tourism 
guide can guide them along their Journey that's   pretty cool if you ask me and we're definitely 
making steps to go in that direction so I'm really   curious to see how that one evolves next one on 
the list comes from chatgpt and I kind of think it   already exists but let me know your thoughts which 
is augmented reality architect so essentially what   it says this person will do is it will be another 
rapidly evolving technology that has the potential   to create new job opportunities an AR reality 
architect could design and create AR experiences   that blend the virtual and physical world I feel 
like that's already here today but I've seen this   trend over and over again after really diving into 
future tech tech talk Tech topics recently of AR   and the possibilities it brings to us in our daily 
lives so I definitely think there is a lot of   opportunity in the world of AR and it looks like 
chat GPT does too who's smarter Tiff or chat GPT   that's the real question next on the list is smart 
city data analysts this individual is someone who   is able to look at a city as a whole similar 
to when you think of city planners nowadays but   for smart cities smart cities are happening today 
already you see especially in areas I know Dubai   has a lot of features around smart cities I know 
there are so many others that I'll list here that   I'm missing but there are so many smart cities 
that are continuing to pop up or trying to evolve   as smart cities as much as possible and with that 
comes a lot of data that is going to be collected   the reality is as everything is automated and 
technology is intertwined further in these   cities data analysts or companies have the ability 
to frankly track what's going on where humans are   going what are they doing what decisions are they 
making now that on its own is a whole other topic   we are not going to get into in this video but the 
reality is just like companies have data analysts   to analyze how people are using their products 
or their apps and what data they can gather there   is the possibility of data analysts specific for 
smart cities this is a really interesting job if   you ask me or could be an interesting job merging 
both city planners Architects but then also to   technologists actually let me pause in some of 
these updates here I really want to highlight   one thing we are talking about jobs of the future 
and for the most part they all are really closely   intertwined with tech do you notice a trend 
here although there are a lot of conversations   happening online right now around how Tech is 
going to become obsolete or Tech workers are going   to become obsolete or or should you even learn 
how to code more everything I just listed I think   well maybe not space tour guide but for the most 
part everything I've listed you need to be pretty   technical or understanding of tech or passionate 
or or be involved in Tech to some degree and I   think that will become closer and closer or 
closely knit together as technology continues   to evolve in our daily lives the need for people 
who understand technology understand code even if   they're not coders per se but understand how Tech 
is built and how it operates is going to become   more and more in demand that's just my personal 
take based on the way things are going and what   we have seen thus far so I guess the point of 
that ramble is if you are worried about should   you still break into Tech or should you learn 
how to code now is a better time than ever if   you ask me I know the jog Market is not ideal now 
where we're not going to cover that but if you are   looking long term I think Now's the Time actually 
this is completely impromptu but I was just doing   doing a video on this extension for chat GPT and I 
just thought why not add it in this video speaking   of future Tech let me show you okay you can see 
my screen here this is very candid I'm doing this   and I just installed this plugin it's called 
Genie by openai it's open source and what it   does is it gives you some shortcuts for your 
code so you can see here there is tests find   problems optimize explain complete code so what 
I have here is a super super simple script it's   really basic but even if you do something where 
it's like let's do add tests and then you can   see here how quickly it is generating the test 
this isn't sponsored or anything I just found   this plugin I thought was really cool and it's 
connected right to open AI I had to put an API   key in from openai to use it and so that's how 
fast it just generated some tests you can also   do say I want to understand these tests I guess 
maybe so highlight it and then go down to explain should explain this code is a unit test oh it's 
not focusing very well but anyways it explains the   code so anyways it's called Genie AP or Genie 
extension for vs code completely free from my   understanding of just installing it and playing 
around with it and yeah if you want to check it   out last on the list I really want to talk about 
is climate reverse specialist and this kind of   already is starting to pop up now as climate 
continues to become such an important topic of   discussion and what climate reverse Specialists 
will do according to online is someone who is   using technology using this data to find ways to 
if not reverse the climate and what we have done   thus far to it at least protect it moving forward 
and Tech is going to be an integral part of that   from understanding the data finding new ways 
with technology to build better Tech to build   better ways to live that aren't having such 
a negative impact on our climate all right I   need to sit down here those are some areas some 
future jobs that don't necessarily exist today   but potentially will in the future and I really 
wanted to make this video because I've done some   short form content on jobs of the future and 
I think it's fascinating just to even start   thinking or looking up some potential jobs for the 
reason of I don't know about you but I always like   to know potentially where I could things I could 
get into things of interest I'm just trying to   understand what the future holds and I think based 
on patterns and data of how Tech has evolved thus   far we have a pretty good sense of where and 
when it will evolve and these roles honestly   if you would have told me a few years about them 
I would have thought you're crazy there's no way   these are going to be a thing and now living in 
today I'm like of course A lot of these make a   lot of sense so I'm curious to hear what do you 
think are some jobs of the future what are some   skills you will need for these jobs data seems to 
be a big Trend cyber security there's different   Trends in each of these jobs that are still coming 
through the reality is though once again if you're   just starting out and I want to know where to to 
begin I would just start out immersing yourself   in technology whether it be in a specific area or 
maybe you don't know a specific area of Interest   yet I would just start out learning some code 
or speaking to people in the industry anyways   leave down below other jobs you think will be 
coming out of tech in the next few years and   that was very slow editor can you speed 
that up I'll see you all soon bye everyone
