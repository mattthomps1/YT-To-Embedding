okay this video is kind of spontaneous 
and the real reason behind it is I've   been getting asked a lot of questions around 
Landing a job in Tech or your career in Tech   navigating it and I'm seeing you make a lot 
of the mistakes that I've made and it brought   up the question Tiff why not share some of 
the biggest mistakes I've made in my Tech   Career thus far some of the biggest failures 
including some really embarrassing moments that   I've had to face so hopefully you don't have 
to that's what we're going to do today also   do you like my new setup if you haven't seen 
that video I'll link it down below where I go   through my desk setup my office setup I'm really 
excited about it anyways let's jump into it as I mentioned I've seen a lot of comments 
recently around careers and navigating your   first job or second job or even maybe you're 
further along in your career and you're like I   just made this massive mistake why didn't someone 
warn me about this so I wanted to really candidly   share with you some of the biggest mistakes I've 
made in my Tech Career and when I say candidly I   mean candid I'm just gonna be very honest with 
you with some of the mistakes that I made along   the way the first one being networking and I share 
this one actually in a short form video recently   and I really want to hone in on it as the first 
Topic in this video because honestly the majority   of us watching this really hate networking and 
if you're one of those anomalies anomalies yeah   anomalies that enjoy never can leave down below 
because I want to know who you are and why do   you enjoy networking actually I don't mind it but 
when I first started out in my career networking   was such a painful thing to do and it was because 
I was so nervous are people going to like me for   who I am are they going to ask me something 
that I'm stumped on you know I'm supposed to   be this technical person what if they ask me a 
question I don't have the answer my I going to   look dumb all these thoughts kept on coming in 
my head and really affecting my ability to put   myself out there to network and it also brings 
up the question well where to network there are   so many places out there do I have to go to in 
person do I do online are people burned out from   going online to network where do I start this 
isn't a question that's just occurred now it is   something that I think has been asked throughout 
time in many different forms so I'm going to share   with you some tips that really helped me with 
networking first being recognize what kind of   person you are and what I mean by that is how you 
communicate best for me when I get in very large   settings especially around people that I'm not as 
familiar with I get really nervous my face gets a   little bit red or a lot red and I stumble on my 
words I feel myself get more nervous and then   in turn I get more nervous and I recognized early 
on that I don't do well in big crowds now this is   something that throughout the years with practice 
I am now much better at but initially when I was   first starting to push myself to network it was 
a big struggle for me and how I overcame that   was recognizing okay there's other people like me 
I'm not alone I'm not the only one who feels this   way so why not try and network and meet people in 
a way that I feel comfortable with which for me   is one-on-ones which is coffee meetups or coffee 
dates whatever you want to call it and so that's   what I started to do I remember the first person 
I networked with was a cyber security engineer   actually at Shopify here in Toronto at the time 
and I didn't know her at all but I reached out to   her I actually reached out to her via social media 
which I don't advise you to do I would do LinkedIn   instead of social media but she was very active 
on social media and I just said hey you know I'm   going to a boot camp that's located right next to 
Shopify I have a few questions for you about how   you got to become a software or a cyber security 
engineer what your role entails could I take you   out for coffee at a time that's convenient for 
you as simple as that really honing in on your   eagerness to learn that you want to connect 
finding a time and place that's convenient for   them if you're doing just virtually than just a 
day and time that's convenient for them doing all   that heavy lifting you could say so that they 
just have to show up essentially and you carry   the conversation or have the questions prepared 
and I think that's one of the biggest things I   really wanted to hone in on is for networking find 
what style works best for you whether it be in you   thrive in large settings because maybe it's not 
so personable and so one-on-one or maybe you're   like me and you would like that one-on-one and 
kind of more intimate settings now actually I'm   going to move on from this topic of networking 
because there's a lot more mistakes we need to   cover but if you're interested in networking and 
want more advice and insight on that and maybe   you think I should make a separate full video 
for that leave down in the comments another   thing I did a huge probably the biggest mistake 
that I made when I first started job hunting and   it really applies though to regardless of where 
you're at in your career is I settled the first   job I ever took let's get personal here I never 
fully shared this story I don't think the first   job I ever took I was so excited to have a job I 
settled I settled on salary I settled on position   on title on everything now I'm very grateful for 
that job it brought me a ton of opportunity and I   had a really great time there but looking back 
I definitely can see that I settled because I   was so anxious and just wanted a job the first 
thing that came my way I accepted and looking   back that's a huge mistake because before you even 
start job hunting especially when you are looking   for one of your first jobs it's easy to feel like 
I just want a job especially if something hasn't   come around for a few weeks or a month and you 
just are so grateful that you end up taking it   this doesn't have to be a mistake you can look 
at it from many different angles but now looking   back I was extremely underpaid okay I'm gonna be 
really candid here I was paid when I first started   my first job right out of University went to a 
coding boot camp I think I was paid 40 000 dollars   Canadian which would be like 30 000 U.S so it was 
I was very I was underpaid if you look at numbers   where you should be paid when you join a company 
when you start out but I'm so excited again that   I just I just took the job the problem the biggest 
mistake with this though isn't even about taking   money out of the equation take title out of the 
equation it's that if you are going to end up   settling at any point in your career you're going 
to start resenting where you work you're going to   realize hey I'm really underpaid I deserve more or 
why is this person making so much more than me and   this person doing so much more than me and in turn 
you're going to want to leave that company sooner   than expected because you're unhappy and that's a 
huge mistake because you want to be able to grow   and nurture your relationship with that company 
build experience there before moving on to the   next now in my case I stock it out but I gotta 
be honest as much as I enjoyed the work enjoyed   the team and all of that the back of my head it 
was always you know how I made a mistake how I   shouldn't have settled and definitely would 
never do that again and and another mistake   that I made when I was first starting out and I 
sometimes catch myself still doing which is not   good is pretending that I know more than I do now 
this doesn't come up in interviews because it's   very clear I think during interviews as to your 
knowledge and I'm not talking about that what I'm   talking about is when you are talking to people 
or yeah having different conversations with people   pretending you know sometimes everything they're 
talking about when maybe you don't because the   reality is that is okay and you actually sound 
more intelligent asking questions about what   they are speaking about then trying to pretend 
you know everything just because you don't know   something that they are specifically talking about 
doesn't mean you are dumb doesn't mean you are not   as smart as them it means you're not as versed 
in that subject as they are that's all it means   and by asking questions and getting curious it 
means that you want to learn you want to hear   more about what they're talking about and I think 
we often do this or I often did this especially   early on in my career because I was scared that 
people would think oh she's not that technical oh   she's not that smart you know she doesn't deserve 
to be here so in turn I've just nod my head agree   and then spend more time than I probably should 
trying to look up what they were talking about   or making mistakes along the way that didn't 
need to be made because of that and I think   that's one of the biggest things that I hope you 
can get comfortable with is ask asking questions   being honest and upfront with your knowledge in 
a specific subject when they come up throughout   conversations and that's something that it takes 
practice to do especially asking questions and   being vulnerable like that because it puts you in 
a position where you're saying hey I don't know a   ton about this subject but you're also being put 
in a position where you're showing you want to   learn and try and look at it from that perspective 
otherwise it can be a little bit overwhelming   saying I don't know and following up with a very 
specific question or curious uh you know prompt   there's nothing wrong with that it's actually 
a positive thing and if anyone ever ever tries   to make you feel silly for asking a question any 
question it's definitely a huge red flag you don't   ever want to be around people who make learning 
or trying to solve different things not enjoyable   or feel like you're being pushed down and that's 
really important as well those are my three main   areas that I want you to always keep in mind when 
you are looking for a new job or growing in your   career networking more I know it's painful at 
times but it's so so important especially as   more competition continues to come not settling 
not being afraid of saying no or this is not what   I had in mind knowing if it's ego or if you are 
settling that's important line to to understand as   well but not settling especially when it comes to 
your career and the last one being open about your   knowledge when you are having these conversations 
and as I mentioned these typically aren't in   interviews you can't really fake those interviews 
but when you are landing the job and growing your   skills being open to not knowing everything but 
rather looking at it as a standpoint of you are   a curious person Forever Learning and through that 
you are going to excel so much more all right I am   so curious to hear where are you at in your career 
are you starting out are you further along are you   job hunting if you're job hunting leave down below
