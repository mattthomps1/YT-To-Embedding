mixed church my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i am so grateful that you've decided to join with us today i truly do believe that you coming today that god has something special for you he is intentionally setting you up for a blessing for breakthrough he is setting you up for a moment that you can understand everything that he's called you to and so i just believe in this moment this time in in this season that god has something in store for us as a church and i am so grateful that you're here today listen i want to share some bad news with you and i don't mean to break this out after a wonderful praise and worship like that but y'all this is our last sunday as summer with the mix y'all and so i know you're a little sad on it pass it where will i get my egg custard snowballs you're gonna go have to pay for them right now i'm sorry we have been kind in our gifting to you and uh and so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna leave out big this summer so you

mix we're so grateful that you've just taken this time and enjoy yourself and i believe that god has been doing something special knitting hearts together he has been knitting minds together he's had the opportunity to really see people come together and create community because one thing i can tell you is community is not about proximity community is about relationship and so i am grateful that relationships have been born and people have invested in time and people have spent those moments together so we say that to you but we're not sad because on starting on august the 7th somebody say august the 7th we are going into 21 days of prayer and so i call it 21 days of change 21 days of breakthrough 21 days of restoration 21 days of god doing something in our lives like never before and so i'm excited about that listen we have for those of you that don't already have many of you who have been a part with us we have what's called our 21 days of prayer booklet and you have two ways that you can get this you can pick it up in the lobby area for a actual physical copy or if you're like me and you just don't feel like carrying around too many books i put it on my ipad and so we have an e-version for you that you can be able to get through the mix app that you can connect with and read through this oftentimes we're asking how do we understand how do we learn more how are we guided better in our faith our faith i really believe this and y'all know i say this that readers are what leaders so in order to lead your life you have to lead your life through the information that god wants to speak into your life and so you need the word of god you need god's word in you need god's word on the outside of you you need god's word around you and in it it can be for you so you want to pick that up but 21 days of prayer that means we will be online praying every morning and then we will come on saturdays here at dunbar high school and we will pray corporate prayer together in person and you want to be a part of that time together i really believe that if you're in expectation transformation can take place in your life in these 21 days why 21 days somebody say why 21 days because you can really form a great habit in 21 days and we want you to form the habit of praying first praying first that god will use you do something in your life and change your life forevermore so we pray first before we worry we pray first and then we lose our mind and then we go back to jesus amen amen listen we're gonna jump also into the word of god we have growth track step one on next week for people that are becoming new members we are so grateful if you're joining the family join us next week after our experience i can't wait to share with you what god is doing here at the local church can we jump into the word of god amen listen take out your notes take out your paper take out your pens whatever it is that you record if we say note takers or what world changes tell your neighbor real quick you're a world changer so take the notes out no i'm just playing don't don't talk to nobody like that but we're going to talk about what it is today i want to talk about joy anybody anybody could use some joy in your life [Music] anybody with everything that's going around with everything that is pressuring you with everything that is taking place in your life lord knows i can use the joy of the lord nehemiah said in nehemiah 8 and 10 the joy of the lord is your strength and i can use some strength and i can use some joy but we're going to jump into galatians chapter 5 and i'm going to read through this and it's important that you understand joy is not a space of emotion joy is not something that comes out of the habit joy does not come out of you being in church joy comes out of this relationship with god and we have to understand how to be able to maintain the relationship that god has given us through truth and understanding not feelings and fiction and so the bible lets us know know if we understand this truth this truth will set us somebody say free i'm calling freedom in the name of jesus galatians chapter 5 starting at verse 16 it says this but i say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh it says for the desires of the flesh are against not for against the spirit it says the desires of the spirit are against the flesh for these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do it says but if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law the bible is letting us know about the old testament the law and which was the commandments that those who were of the law were unable to keep anyway so he said you can't even keep the law but if you would just operate by the spirit you will actually be in accordance with what the law was trying to do it says now the works of the flesh the bible says are evident it says sexual immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy fits of anger rivalries dissensions it says divisions envy drunkenness orgies and things like these i warn you [Music] this is paul speaking to the church he says i want to warn you that these are dangers that come out of operating out of your flesh he says i warn you as i warned you before lord anybody can be honest in here that the lord has told you something once but you needed it repeat it multiple times anybody ever been there before it's like lord i know you told me once but tell me one more time because i really need clarity on what the what we were talking about he said so listen i'm not even just telling you this for the first time i'm bringing this out to you he says again he says that those who do such things he says i want to clarify this it doesn't matter how much you say you love me it doesn't matter how much you have it together he says i want to warn you that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god he says but the fruit somebody say fruit the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness [Music] faithfulness gentleness that's that one right here self control my god it says against such things there is no law and those who belong to christ have crucified the flesh they've not made an excuse for the flesh they've crucified the flesh with its passions and desires it says if we live by the spirit then let us also keep in step with the spirit tell your neighbor real quick say keep up with the spirit it says let us not become conceited provoking one another in being one another i want to talk from the message title that you can write down in your notes real quick a guaranteed outcome a guaranteed out come let's pray father in the name of jesus we declare today in this moment you are with us and you're for us so i pray that our hearts will be opened so that you can be in us speak to our hearts speak to our minds give us this opportunity to know that you are changing the way that we think the way that we live the way that we operate all through your spirit in jesus name somebody say amen thank you so much amazing musicians y'all can you help me give it up for our amazing dream team our volunteers that are in the house can you help me just love on them real quick you might be saying pastor why would you choose that scripture out of all scriptures that you could have chosen to talk about joy you could have went to nehemiah you could have went to hebrews chapter 12 and talked about the joy that was set before christ why would you go through this area of walking us through talking about the deeds of the flesh and the deeds of the spirit because what i want to introduce to you in this space is a joy that god is offering you that does not come according to the set of circumstances of where your life is but it's a joy that's grounded in understanding and knowing who god is i want to get you out of a place where your idea is the only way that i can be happy if things are going the way that i want the time that i want with the people that i want and the space that i want and my happiness is contingent upon what it is that's happening in my life the bible is letting us know that there is something that happens in the spirit that is greater than the joy that we can just have outside of the things that our flesh desires but what he is saying is that a fruit of the spirit of god growing and operating in your life is something called joy somebody say joy see the ups and downs of life get us at a place where we can oftentimes believe that whatever it is that we do can give me joy if my marriage was just a little bit better i could have joy if if if my financial situation was a little bit better i could have joy if i had the right person in my life it would be joy for me but here's what i want to let you know is that god is establishing that there is a joy that comes from him that even in your lowest states of life when the enemy is on your back he is saying there is a joy that is redefined through the idea that it's not about what you have and what you don't have it's about who you have and who is for you there's a joy that goes exceeding there's a joy that is established in your life that's greater than what you could ever expect of yourself there's a joy that when all things seem to be in its most broken place there is a joy that the bible says is greater than what you could ever imagine or think anybody could use a joy in your lowest points of life anybody could use a joy when you don't know what's about to happen next and you don't have the resources to change what you want to change when you want to change how you want to change it could anybody use a joy that even in your most broken state you still feel good i can use a joy like that because life can really get broken and sad we can have some hard trying times even when no one else does stuff to us can we get hard on ourselves anybody know yourself to be hard on your own self anybody know yourself to be like you look at like if i had just done that better if i had been there if i had gotten this together this would be a better place for me but the problem is is that oftentimes i lose joy just by talking to my own self because there are times in my life where i don't feel as confident about myself as god has seen in the way he created me and the way that god created you is greater than what you think about yourself you are god's creation you are the bible says ephesians 2 and 10. you are a masterpiece created in christ jesus to do good work but if you could be honest most of the time i don't always get to see myself in masterpiece form i see myself as a copycat i can see myself as not an original but something that has been mocked off i can see myself as an idea or something being copied but i want to let you know today you are i heard the song say a designer's original you are one of a kind there's something special about you i just want you to look at your hand real quick everybody just put your hand up to your face and i want you to look at it there is nobody else that has a fingerprint like yours you are unique [Applause] but if you looked at yourself in life oftentimes you you would lose joy because your uniqueness you would say still doesn't define the great things that i want to happen in my life and god is saying today what i want to let you know is that you'll never define that unique joy that's on the inside of you if you look for it to be pleased by the desires of your flesh somebody say flesh now you got to say it with disgust flesh because if you don't get that disgust with your flesh what i'm trying to tell you is is that you will look to create opportunities for your flesh to be pleased some of y'all right now think about brunch why because you're hungry pastor i ain't eat today so make sure you wrap it up on time because we got to 12 30 we got to get to the flesh is always calling for us and it's always desiring something from us but the problem is is there are situations in our life where we cannot appease our flesh and we have to just go through where we are right now i'll never forget august 2008 i get married one of the most amazing days of my life outside of accepting jesus i come and i am excited about starting this life with my wife and my children and on november the 13th i'll never forget i'm admitted into the hospital i'm admitted to the hospital because prior to that i had a fainting spell where i passed out on the floor i was with some friends but they didn't know i passed out on the floor and i got dizzy i woke up and didn't know what happened that's a scary thing y'all that's a place to be and i woke up and i and i got myself together and i looked and i was like okay okay maybe i need to get something to eat anybody ever become their own doctor y'all you start diagnosing yourself anybody ever been there you start webmdn oh my god is something on my hand it's blue i don't know what it is you start tripping out it may be the monkey pox it's like no you forgot you had a marker in your hand you're like oh yeah that's what it was like we start tripping we're on a plane we hear people cough we're automatically saying oh god no please not me what i want to tell you is that i'll never forget november 13th two months half later after being married that i pass out and i go to the doctors i say to the doctors hey i don't know what's going on you know could have been some loss of oxygen i'm not sure what's happening but i want to let you know i passed out if you'd asked me as a man i wouldn't have went but i just got married so insurance hadn't kicked in didn't want to leave my wife out there like that y'all know what i'm saying no y'all can smile in church i promise you it's okay they're like that's not funny past that's serious i'm here i made it so you already know the end of the story all right don't get nervous context is when i get into the hospital the doctor says hey i know what happened i said awesome what do we need to do he says we need to have a second heart surgery he said because on the vow that was replaced in your heart four years ago because you were still on dialysis calcification has taken place on this aortic valve and we now need to put a metal valve on the inside of you i looked at and i said are you sure you know what you're talking about he said i'm pretty sure i'm sure this is where it is this is what's taking place let me help you we can get this surgery he says we can get the surgery done really quickly and make it happen the surgery happens all these things that i remember from four years ago start back over again anybody ever went through life once before and you're like i'm never trying to go back through life again but life seems to poke its head one more again as much as you did to avoid it as much as you did to stay away life still pull well i poked his head back again i'll never forget metal wires on the inside of me having to be yanked out i'll never forget a tube helping me to breathe i'll never forget relearning how to walk it was a whole thing y'all you get to this point in life and i'm like thank you lord you brought me up i'm in the recovery room i'm trying to tell you how good my god is [Applause] i'm in a recovery room while i'm standing in the recovery room a nurse walks in she's a nurse practitioner she looks at me and she says mr england we did exams and and we everything is going good with your heart but she said but what she gets me together and she says i gotta tell you some news my wife is sitting with me i'm sitting on the bed she starts crying [Music] i have to console her i say hey it's okay i mean i don't know if it's okay but it's okay at least for you and so i don't know what to do in this moment i didn't know this is how this was about to transpire this is okay she says it's not i said tell us the news she said we found a cancer spot on your kidney i looked i said okay i said god's in control i'll never forget after that a friend came in a friend of the faith and they came in and you ever had a friend come in to encourage you but you want up encouraging them and i'll never forget the friend came in and i'm part of this moment with them and they they say to me what's going on man i was like man we just got news i think they found cancer on my kidney and it just begins to bawl man [Music] i can't believe this is happening he's like seven feet so i'm like this this almost feels like the lord is talking you know like uh-huh and and and he's talking to me and he's crying he's like you shouldn't be going through this it's like you shouldn't be dealing with this in life you just got out of this you just got married you've got a family at home and he's like you shouldn't have to go through this but the truth of the matter is i had to go through it in order to become all that god's called me to be i wish i could have changed it but the bible lets me know that all things will work together for the good and what i started recognizing is i was able to encourage him because there was a supernatural joy that was inside of me i want to talk to you about it because what's really easy to get yourself involved in is to come to christ and lose your joy you'll lose your joy because you believe that the relationship that you have with christ is about you finding yourself in position that nothing will go wrong in life but i'm here today to let you know that the bible lets us know very honestly that you will go through trials of every kind but the bible says he'll never leave you nor forsake you let's get into the good part of this god offers you a joy that is unspeakable and it's full of glory even in the darkest times and most broke times of your life i want to let you know when everything seems to be going opposite you can still have joy just let your neighbor know real quick you can still have joy i don't care what you're going through right now i don't care how bad it looks you can still have joy why because it's a spiritual thing it's not just an emotional peace i need the joy of the lord which nehemiah said is what your strength i need a joy that comes in in the midnight hour when things seem to be broken and all is lost i need joy why do you worship let me talk about real quick why you see me in the front losing my mind during praise and worship and real quick why you need to be here at 10 30 and get here on time so that you can experience it because there's something about the building of my faith that happens when i put myself in position for god to speak and move inside of me through our worship so when our worship team begins to minister and you see me moving or dancing it's not because i feel always like it it's because i have an understanding of that god is doing something even in the midst when i don't feel like it he's changing things he's making things he's moving things he's operating in a way so i begin to lift my hands what in expectation god you're doing something more than i could imagine or even think why cause i'm gonna praise you anyhow i learned a long time ago to stop praising him when it gets good and start praising them even in the seasons where it looks bad to lift my hands and get right there you'll see me tap on this stage and i'll tell my worship team i need a little bit more because what i'm going through i need god to move on my behalf i'm not feeling it today i'm not in the right head space but if you could just allow the anointing that's on your life to minister to me right there god can take me where i need to go he can make me who he needs to make me to be and i'll rejuvenate myself because i'll speak to myself like david said get yourself together that's what my worship is about it's not about waiting for a feeling it's not about for this pansy relationship that you do on sundays when it benefits you it's about i am rooted and grounded and knowing that my joy cannot be moved cause he's with me all right have your seats everybody take your seats we're not done yet we still got more minutes but i want to give you a clarity that if you live your life based on the flesh you will never achieve the purpose and potential that god has for your life because you will be always subject to your desires feel like it today i don't feel like it today it'll require all that i don't need to do all that and that's why your joy becomes circumstantial because it's dependent on the condition of where your mind is that day and if you don't understand that your emotions are due to a chemical issue that's happening in your body that's making you feel different one day than it does the next day then you don't understand the imbalance of what it is to rely on the things that are around you to keep your joy intact that's why it's got to be something of the spirit and if it's of the spirit it means it's not being maintained by me or my condition or my environment it means that when i call on the name of the lord he steps in right on time and when i just say jesus he begins to insert a joy that is unspeakable and full of glory what does it do it gives me a strength that gives me an idea that this thing is not over yet and i've got something on the inside of me that's a little bit of hope that says if i could just hold on a little bit longer something is on the way so that's why i can't give over to every fleshly desire and every broken subject idea that this world gives us because my idea is i live for the spirit not the flesh for those that live by the flesh shall not inherit the kingdom of god i don't want you to leave out of here with a false gospel an unbiblical truth and you're thinking this thing of it's just gonna be i love jesus and he loves me for the bible says those who love the lord he says you'll be obedient to my words so i want to clarify for you biblically we are not living in a loved one relationship that does not have requirements if that was jesus you know jesus loved jesus said his love is understood when you become obedient to his love and it becomes greater than your fleshly feelings it becomes about what we do in the spirit of god so when you live out of that joy you can hear a cancer report and still be able to encourage someone else because it's not dependent on how you feel it's dependent on who you know and who you know tells you what is and because he declares what is i can speak those things that are not as though they are i'm victorious are you why because i'm holding to this great hope and so i don't have to be depressed over every bad news i don't have my mold to change because things don't go the way i want them to i don't have to go into a depression because things are not going the way i want i can still maintain my joy [Applause] how do you smile i made the decision to choose joy not opt for joy i'm choosing it what you gonna do today i'm choosing to make a move i'm choosing to walk in his way i'm choosing to look at his path i'm choosing to deny my flesh i'm choosing that he is the way the truth and the life i am choosing not because there's a law not because the bible says oh you got to it's because he's instilled in me a joy supernaturally that makes me want to follow him the struggle that we have with the bible and our desire is that we have not given up and crucified our flesh as the scripture says so that we can experience supernatural many of us are living on sunday impulse and we dry out we are dead as soon as the announcement's hit y'all see that announcement come on and it'd be like welcome get in the mix i'm out of here i'm out i'm out i'm not doing this cause it's like i'm missing i came for this thing and it got me enough so i'll wait till next week to get it again and the problem is i had it when i came in it just needed a little maintenance so i got into worship i'm all in the front i know my hands and the cameras i'm doing everything pretty sing you better do something i'm yelling at the team they like please we're trying [Applause] the idea behind it is that i'm maintaining my relationship and in maintaining my relationship i maintain my joy that supernatural not that's artificial today it's important that you know that why is it important that you know that and i want to lead you into these very quick points that's going to be important to you point one that i want to give you is that what we tend to do and i'm about to give to you it's killing us and that's the idea of comparison comparison is the thief of joy it's robbing you it's robbing you you're a masterpiece but you're trying to compromise to another identity that fits your liking and the problem is is that they don't match and so you have an issue because it's not pleasing your flesh so your flesh is leaving you at a place of despondent and now you don't have joy because you don't feel it and comparison says if you knew who god called you to be and the identity that he set upon your life you would be so good with where you are now because you would understand you don't know who i'm about to become like if you could just get a little bit above yourself the bible says we are a little too haughty but if you really understood the word of god you would get sure within yourself because you would understand i am of a chosen generation i am of the priesthood of who god is called all my needs are met through christ jesus so you would not waver so much the problem is is anybody like me that you buy things and you never look at the instructions anybody wrestle with that spirit listen what you do you put the box in front of you be like let's go all right i don't need that part that's not on there i don't see that like this is not a 3d model you don't know what's on the other side of that you guessing i think your screw goes here and it comes with y'all said it it comes with what instructions here's what the devil knows like companies know you don't pay attention to the instructions so we'll make it optional you can go online and look at it if you like and we'll give you a real simple version but what we're telling you is is you're not going to look at the instruction man can i get you in here how many of y'all around here looking at these instructions how many of you have had to repent after the ikea assembly if you've ever assembled anything from ikea i promise you you have walked away and said lord forgive me for the things i just said please forgive me because i know what i just said and that screw is supposed to fit to that hole but if you know ikea i don't know somebody would sleep on the job but that screw is up here and that hole is down and you're like some don't match and sometimes you think it's supposed to go a certain way but it doesn't and how many times have you looked at the box but you got it wrong and interpret it wrong and how many of you have heard some christians somewhere on instagram or or some false teacher and they told you this was okay and you started walking along with christianity the way somebody told you instead of looking at the book problem is is we're not good god followers we don't follow instructions well because we don't like to read i have my car book that's right here and it goes to my car i know many of you have a vehicle and have never looked in the glove compartment to see anything about how that 2 000 to 80 000 car even runs it's one of the most costly things that you have and you've never looked at the manual we can do right now but everybody let's go outside and go to your car and you'll be like hold on hold on wait a minute i don't know where the manual is are they putting it in the trunk now like did the dealer even give me a manual i never checked [Applause] because we don't go to the manual until there's a problem we're not preventative christians we're reactive christians well what does the bible say when i feel this way well what does it say when this is happening to me because it shouldn't be happening and the problem is is you've had the instructions all this time but now you're trying to look up the instructions according to the problem and you're misinterpreting bible because you're looking for the problem isolated instead of knowing the entire book you don't understand that the dash is connected to the windows and the windows are connected to the back seat and the back seat is connected to what you don't understand it's a total electrical thing and you're trying to isolate the problem and when you isolate the problem you're out of context of scripture and when you're out of context of scripture you find yourself misinterpreting improperly and now you're justifying your flesh instead of walking in the spirit because you never read the guide well we don't read the guide we don't know how to prevent it and get prevented what maintenance that's oh that's what sunday is it's my prevent why your hands always up man preventive maintenance i'm working against the ego i'm working against the flesh i'm working against the thing that says men don't worship god we don't stand up we don't give god praise that says i don't have to do all that he doesn't require all of me that's how those kind of churches you know those charismatic churches do no no what i understand is that when i begin to praise him out of a place where i don't feel like it anymore and i push my ego i push my pride i push my desires to the side and i begin to lift up the holy god the king of kings and the lord of lords and i begin to establish you are lord you are a king i worship you when i feel like it and when i don't because you are god guess what happens i don't fall into what we talked about last week which is temptation but you're trying to fight off things that you don't have the instructions to fight off and you're looking for solutions and now the solutions have become addictions now you're stuck now you in it now you're like oh man how do i get out of i should have been in my my word and too much of us are getting the word from everyone's opinion instead of going to the book so now you're comparing and it's stealing your joy because your joy is being lost in comparison and the spiritual part of what god wants to do in you you're trying to make it happen through a natural aspect and it's not happening and you're frustrated and god is saying if you could just go to my word if you would stop trying to fill your life with things that would make you happy you would find yourself in a place where you're happy before you get the things you know what half the time impulse buying is impulse buying is buying because you haven't made a decision on what you were going to do and what you want so you just buy you're in the supermarket just like me i'm supposed to get eggs milk toilet paper i got waffles steaks i'm out here shopping seafood i get back home my wife is like did you get the eggs that's what it was that's what it was because i didn't predetermine what i was going to do and some of us with our relationship with jesus we haven't predetermined how we're going to walk because we don't have a standard because we haven't read his word so we're making it up as we go and we add things according to how we feel so we walk in the desire of the flesh aisle right and we just pick up what we want god says i'm the head and not the tail god says you know what i have a standard and you see something you see a state ladies you like my god is that on sale you know how we do look at that because you haven't predetermined what a man of god should look like you'll take a resemblance [Music] and then you'll take one in the season when you're not supposed to have one you are supposed to get eggs [Music] eggs you're supposed to be finding a job how are you dating you ain't got no money you say well you see how we get it backwards and we say but i needed this but it's not the right time well how you know if you would just go into the word of god you will understand that if you wait on the lord and be of good carriage but you can you can't wait for carriage you can't wait for what you need because you're more into your need your wants than what god has for you comparison is the thief of joy is stealing it you're looking at everybody else some of you doing 21 days you just need to shut your phone off stop looking at whatever well you know the church up the street let me ask you about church up the street well you know when i was at the other am i actually that what we're asking you is what is god saying to you now because old seasons cannot bring new revelation in new seasons you need god to bring a new word to you you need god to speak something new because you've never done this before so how are you taking old ways and adding them to new seasons that you've never been a part of because we're creatures of habit and out of habit i do what i used to do and i think it's enough in comparison to what god wants for me but the problem is he's doing exceeding abundantly above what you could ask or think so if you never thought it before then old ways can't compare to new ways god's trying to move you forward you're trying to rely on what you know and god's like i'm trying to do somebody say anew he said i'm trying to do a new thing the old has passed behold all things are new which means i need what instructions not broken examples because they got a lot of likes or they seem deep you know how people seem deep they walk up to you in a very low tone just want to prophesy to you to you excuse me first of all that voice is creepy get away that's just weird [Applause] god i need you to come another way because i'm scared i'm not taking that i don't know i know who you are but i'm not taking that word it's the truth we're asking god like lord i want to hear you guys i got like i got you you like but can you do it another way because that's just that was it i missed the word give me another one your gracious god stop comparing yourself tell your neighbor real quick stop comparing yourself stop you're not like everybody else you're not where everybody else is you where you are so let god do what he wants to do in your life for where you are point number two your joy is beneath the surface i say that to you because many of us are operating out of hurt and pain and our joy is lost in our past scripture says in james chapter one verse two and three says consider it nothing but joy my brothers and sisters whenever you fall into various trials be assured that the testing of your faith through experience produces endurance leading to spiritual maturity and inner peace count it all joy if you're still living in the unforgiveness you can't count it joy if you're still telling people you know i don't like the way this is i don't if you're still only thinking about you you cannot count it all joy you need to dig out from under your broken surface and say god i want real joy today i know i had a broken past i know that last relationship messed me up i know i've had money problems but i need a refreshing start in you today i need to come from under this surface of bitterness unforgiveness can i tell you what the bible don't say but a lot of us do pettiness some of y'all so petty y'all live on pettyville on petty lane and why are you like no i'm good no you're petty because you're doing things that you know are trying to anger and break and build somebody to a place of frustration that you find yourself getting joy out of it and you're living in pettiness because you've got your own brokenness that you haven't gotten healing from some of us need spiritual brokenness uh spiritual healing coupled with professional counseling you are messed up from your past from your last divorce from your last bankruptcy you are jacked up and you need jesus and mr jim because you have not dealt with it what you did was escape from it and if you got out of the environment of it you've convinced yourself that you're okay and the problem is is every time it presses back up in you here's what you say well they make me that way the problem is that it's still inside of you [Music] what's not inside can't come out so it means it's got to be where inside if you blow up it's inside if you have anger issues it's inside if you have trust issues it's inside if you have sexual immorality issues it's inside it's not on your flesh it's in your flesh you didn't wipe it off you need healing so go to god and go to ms wallace and sit down for an hour and say i have never dealt with this from my past [Applause] point number three is joy is an inheritance you inherit joy i want to let you know today you're not working for joy it's an inheritance to what god is offering you as sons and daughters i inherit this joy you gotta say this today joy is mine it's not like did i what did did i do enough today to get no joy is mine i inherit joy what as a son and daughter of jesus christ i inherit supernatural joy that keeps me lifted at the darkest times david told us if i walk through the valley you're there [Music] you're there [Music] and what i inherit i keep it's not because i was able to work for it i was good enough for it i served enough for it i came enough sundays for it i was articulate for it i'm trying to let you know it's an inheritance in your life when you come to know jesus you're just dropping that thing there are supernatural gifts that he says [Music] you're like i get gifts yes anybody like gifts oh my gosh and you don't understand but the fruit of the spirit the fruit what comes from living a spirit-filled life with the holy spirit the bible says you are entitled to love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control it's yours [Applause] [Music] they're gifts of the spirit pastor i don't have it then that means there's something broken in the reciprocity system between you and the spirit and it's not the spirit [Music] if you're asking you're saying listen i need this fruit in my life then you need the spirit you don't need to work harder you don't need to try to be nice because that's what we try to do nice christians everybody's faking when you zap out [Music] you know what i'm saying you zap oh my gosh i know christians listen i want to tell you real quick the world is so confused on christianity because they haven't seen a consistent view of what a christian is because we all seem like we're reading three different types of bibles and we all have our preference and our way and the bible says when we get to heaven jesus is going to say i don't know you [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus i i cast out demons in your name i did all this work in your name that's cool problem is you weren't obedient to my word and you didn't live by the spirit you live by your desires i want to let you know today that you're due for an inheritance [Music] an inheritance comes once somebody dies i want to let you know if you are not a jew in here you are of the inheritance of jesus christ you are a gentile and when christ died and rose again you just started inheriting things i'm going to inherit love i'll inherit patience i inherit joy i'll inherit peace on her kindness our hair self-control how did you get it i didn't work for it it's an inheritance [Applause] but it operates with the spirit it's a guaranteed outcome in your life that you will experience joy unspeakable the bible says and full of glory
