[Music] thank you we're going to jump into the word of God's Genesis it's not hard to find it's really that first book of the Bible you can jump right in there should be page one no I'm just playing that's not how it works in the Bible but you can look at Genesis the first book of the Bible and we're going to start Genesis chapter 12. this has to be one of my favorite this has to be something I declare over my life here's something it's not something just for me it's something for you and I believe God wants to speak if I if if I was being really really cool I think I'm doing a part two to what I just did on last week and so we're going to talk about next today Genesis chapter 12 verse one through three and it reads it says now the Lord said to Abram Abram who becomes Abraham later in scripture is who we know as the father faith he is the father of those in whom we know to be God's people Israel he's also Father to the Arab Nation through Ishmael the Lord has given Abram an opportunity to be a part of his plan his plan to establish a nation a nation that will bring forth a savior a savior that will change the course of the world forever he says now the Lord said to Abram go from your country go from the place of your birth go from where you are familiar and your kindred and your father's house to the land I will show you I need you to pay attention to that verse and the last part of it where it says to the land I will show you Pastor why is that important because I need you to understand while God will call you to a vision he will not make the vision happen for you there is something that God has shown you but it is your responsibility with God to be a conqueror of that in which he has shown you one of the questions I want to ask you today is what has God shown you what has God said that he will give that he will put under your hand what has God shown you and if he's shown you what have you done with what he's shown you my question today if whatever God has shown you you can do of yourself it's not from God because anything that God shows you is greater than what you have the resource the skill set the ability or the network to do by your self he said I will show you verse 2 he says I will make you I want to tell somebody today where you are God is making you I will make you a great nation I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing I will make your name great so that you will be a blessing you want to write that down because the reason for God blessing you is not about you the reason that God wants to bless you is for something greater than what you could ever do on your own he says I will make your name great and I will bless you so that you can be a blessing I'm blessing you to be a blessing I'm blessing you to be a blessing I'm blessing you to be a blessing I'm promoting you to be a blessing I'm giving you increase to be a blessing I didn't give it to you so that you could draw a distance from me I'm blessing you to be a blessing I gave you a child to be a blessing I gave you the house to be a blessing you have your PhD to be a blessing I gave you the business to be a blessing I gave you your mate to be a blessing somebody tell your neighbor it wasn't for you oh my goodness all this time you you were praying God bless Ed territory and you've been a little shy on God fulfilling it because God said you don't understand that when I open this Floodgate open it's not a flood gate for you it's a Floodgate for everybody around you I'm calling you to be a blessing he says I will bless those who bless you and whom him who dishonors you I will curse and in you all the families of the Earth shall be blessed I want to come from the topic positioned for next can we pray today father position me for next amen amen God bless you thank you so much musicians can y'all help me give it up for our Dream Team our worship team our production team our security team our kids team our greeters our hosts our product everybody in their respective places thank you we could not do this without you let's let's just lay this down real quick everything that God has established in your life is not only for your purpose of enjoying for your purpose of sharing to others to view what God has blessed you with is for the purpose of being a blessing and many times I don't understand positionally why God has placed me where I am and I'm trying to tell you today that God wants to use You When God says I want to use you the reason that he really makes this an understanding is he says I I want to bless you but I want to bless you so that you can be a pathway to Future blessings God is not interested in blessing you so that you can take a picture of it with yourself leaned up against it to tell everybody look I got this look everybody in this looking amazing watch how many degrees I got look at where I'm staying look at how I'm living God said I did not bless you for you I bless you for the person next to you tell somebody real quick beside you he blessed me for you if I could get the understanding that the reason God is blessing me so is because that he is trying to make me a blessing for the needs of someone else I would stop finding myself in such a place where I would be praying for God to do for me without understanding that everything God is going to do for me is for someone else the context is is that I've become a pathway for God to use to bless the Earth the Bible says he called Abram and said I'm going to bless you now I can tell you right there that's an opportunity to praise God anytime God tells you I'm going to bless you that's a moment to shout that's a moment to get a skip if I was in an Apostolic church I know non-denominational is right here but there will be an organ pumping me up and putting on a high key right now when God says I'm going to bless you you just start thinking about everything oh God you're gonna give me the car oh God I'm gonna be flying or wait till the shoes that I buy I'm trying to tell you the Rolex is going to be wonderful I'm trying to tell you you ain't gonna know who I am once you see me it's gonna be a blessing here's the problem God has anointed you to be able to receive because God has anointed you to be able to give there cannot be an anointing of receiving without an anointing of giving God has called for you to be a giver not only does the Bible says we need to give but he calls for us to give in the right manner with the right heart the Bible says the lord loves one eight a cheerful Giver there's a difference in understanding that my act or my work of giving just comes at the place of me performing the duty the Bible says there must be some kind of intentionality with it God says you've got to be a cheerful Giver in order to do something cheerfully it means you got to do something for something that means something to you meaning I've got to give out of love I don't know if you understand critically how much that means to us as Christians because if you go back to the scripture in John 3 16 the Bible says for God's so loved the world that he did what he what cave our Salvation is built on a whole monetary system of God doing business on the cross he was conducting business and transacting things for the benefit of your soul and the benefit of your sins he said I'm going to make a transaction take place on Calvary I'm going to do what's called redeemed there's going to be a Redemption for who you are the Bible lets us know that when he got on the cross he had to do what shed his blood there is no greater cause than to be able to shed your blood for someone else and the Bible tells us that Jesus loved us so much that he gave his one and only son here's the thing is that you cannot love and not give anything that you love you give to you y'all you listen so some of us know that we spoil and how do you get spoiled by getting what you what and somebody gives you what you want because they want to see you happy they give you what you want so that you can be happy or they give you what you want so they can get what they want is that a possibility that sometimes that's our deal with God God I'm going to give today but I need you Lord I need you to open that door now I I'm not I'm giving an extra ten dollars in this offer and I know you see me Lord don't play I need that promotion today like not tomorrow today because I got some things I got to do and so I want to give you a little bit extra anybody ever been there before I I've been there before where we didn't have a reservation and and I went into the restaurant and I said can I get a table for a couple and I said sir I'm sorry we don't have any available space and I looked at them I said you have none and they said we have none I said you have none they said we don't have any I looked and went into my wallet and I slid something past them I said you have none they said right this way sir [Applause] because the idea is that oftentimes if you give me what I want I'll give you what you want but the Bible says we have a God that's so amazing that he died before you were even here he considered you before you even got here can I tell you today as amazing as you are and as amazing and gifted as you think you have it together God is saying I don't even need you I died because I loved you he said I want to give you a posture of what giving is all about we give not because we get back we get because we love and he says I want to posture you to understand you need the kind of heart that gives out of love I don't want anything bad for you why did you give it to me because I just wanted to do that well what do you want from me I don't need anything from you God has already given me enough I understand that he has created me as a pathway to get further to create further to do more so here's the understanding the more that I give to you is the more that God blesses me foreign and all the time I've been keeping away because I think I am the controlling Factor on who should receive and who shouldn't receive and God says you don't have anything to do with that all you are is a pathway a pathway means I am something that God uses to flow through the Bible says he will open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing you don't have room to receive the problem is is that some of us have stopped being a pathway and we start being a Dead Sea oh the problem with the Dead Sea if you don't understand is that the Dead Sea does not have an exiting route for things to come in fresh and for things to escape and the problem with it is is that because it is it is not moving water it has no ability to flow some of us have positioned ourselves that we believe we're doing God such a Justice by giving over our gifts to him we come in very high and mighty and saying God I could do other things I don't have to be subjected to this point and God says you don't understand you're blocking your own blessing I am trying to use you as a conduit to be a blessing to bigger things I'll use you to bless others to bless a nation to create a new community if you'll be a pathway just tell your neighbor real quick be a pathway I need to be able to flow but the only way I can flow is if I'm not a barrier to the hindrance and things of God the Lord tells Abram as Abram is coming out of his place as Abram is coming out of this place the Bible says call ER the land of the Chaldeans the Bible says that he pulls them from his family his Kindred his people and he says Abram I want you to go to a place that you've never been before that's how he called them April that's what he did he called him idea behind it is that so many of us have a vision and a word from God but we have a vision in the word without going anywhere because we want got to work Where We Are instead of him taking us and moving us to a place that we can grow to be everything he's called for us to be the broken part about where we are in our thinking is that Comfort is What We crave for and the comfort of What We crave for leaves us at a place where we don't get to see a new land a new land means we don't get to see what God has in store the Bible says he said I will show you I will show you the land that I have for you it was Abram's responsibility to get there and Abram's responsibility to rest and to be wherever God called him to be here's the thing you can have a word from the Lord but if you do not move according to the word of the Lord you will find yourself with a word and no vision to accomplish what he said [Applause] my question today it says God given you a word but you're still in the same place you were because you don't believe he can do the impossible go to a land I'll show you where are we going I'll show you how are we going to get there I'll show you well how long am I going to be gone I'll show you how when we what you want me to take I'll tell you here's what that requires it requires you to trust God along the way for something you don't already have the plans to do for yourself and God is saying I want to position you at a place where because I've anointed you to be a part of something greater than you I have to explain to you along the way because if I gave it to you all at once it would overwhelm you that's why half of us are living in anxiety because we're living with a vision that we're scared to accomplish so we're sitting in place with what God has spoken to us but we have not moved according to where God's called for us to go so we're on Vision overload because we have not trusted God says go to a place go go why is God trying to tell you to go because God is trying to separate you anybody know them lonely days when you when you home by yourself and you you're trying to figure out do You Really Got Friends anybody I've been there before like you you start looking down your do I got I don't feel right now like I got friends because if you live the life where it's just like party party all the time like like I'm not even talking about your part like you always have something going on anybody know about I always got I'm always doing something I'm always like my life is like man what you doing man I'm just busy and God sits you down and immediately the anxiety sets in I'm doing nothing with my life anybody I've been there before [Applause] because you believe that being still means being inactive and you don't know what God is doing in the moments when you're being still because he's separating you and moving you from things that you were never supposed to be a part of because he called you out of I need you to understand God has called you out of some things to put you in something you can't get to where you're going still where you used to be God's gotta call you out of it and put you into it [Applause] this is what I would call Point number one the forsaking stage he's calling you to be set apart set up shut up means what he's he's of to be holy from to get a different mindset here is the thing that happens in the stage of forsaking he's trying to change a way of thinking [Applause] everything that you come to God with that you say you're not that you won't do that you don't have the resources for that's not your gifting that you can't do you've been doing this for a long time my mama said my daddy said I can't go that way I ain't gonna do it that way I'm just trying to tell you this is how we've been doing it this is who I am God says I need you to forsake all others foreign you mean like you mean like my my cousins like my second cousins no no he said I called you from the land of your fathers leave all of it behind your land your Kindred everything bounce wait wait a minute guy you want me to leave my support wait wait a minute ago you you want me to leave my comfort he says I want you to leave what you have control over to take you into something that I'm giving you that you don't have control over because I need to guide every in every path of the way that you're going so that you recognize at the end this was the hand of God I take no credit it's not about me it's not what I had the ability to do but you say to yourself God because I understand where you're taking me this is the separating season of what God is speaking it feels like you're being dis deconstructed in the forsaking stage I promise you this is your stage where you had it all together and then right then when God speaks you don't know nothing about yourself anybody can I mean can we really talk about [Applause] I don't I don't I don't filed a whole LLC I didn't put a whole I got we got a bank account for it I don't got a degree for it God you what do you talk I've been in school for 75 years to get this are you telling me that we walking away all this work I sorry we did and you tell and God says I'm calling you and I'm setting you apart it doesn't mean that I won't use what you have but the problem is is that I probably won't use it like the way you want see the reason I gave it to you and built it for you was out of the idea that I would use it for the way I wanted it to be used not for the way you wanted so that it would bless you and that you would be a benefit to yourself he says I'm calling you out and setting you apart because why 50 000 people have your degree you're going to be the one that breaks chains [Applause] the difference in understanding that God has called me out to create something that's more than I could imagine a thing the Bible says he's calling you to something that no eye is seen and no ear is heard and no mind has conceived you're trying to repeat just do it better God says I'm trying to do somebody say a new thing if you could understand like we talked last week that God is trying to establish you you would recognize that in the forsaking stage I've got to let go of some things that I have built up my mind and perspective to say this is when I do it this is how I do it I do it on this timeline here don't mess up my schedule God says I don't care enough about your schedule [Applause] I'm trying to transform you you're in a transforming stage scripture lets us know in Luke Chapter 14 verse 33 it says this so then any of you who does not forsake renounce surrender claim to give up say goodbye to all that he has cannot be my disciple You Gotta Give It Up no I no because Pastor I hope no no this is there there are certain things I will do and there are certain things I won't do Jesus says then you're not for me because everything that concerns me is about what you're willing to give up for me you lose your life you gain it some of us hold on to things in our lives so tight that we can never be healed because our ideologies Trump God's word you're like well the Bible doesn't say it this way but what does God say well you know the Bible gives me lead like we're not here to talk about the testimony of what he gives the Bible is the testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Bible lets us know what Jesus did how he came and we believe in the resurrection of the word of God so back to the point what did God say because if God said it then it can be fulfilled in your life if it can be fulfilled in your life then it means it's for the impact of others I want to tell you today there is a set apart stage that God wants to get you in here's why this is the most important stage this is the most important stage because most Christians stay at this stage they're coming to Salvation they ask God to forgive them their water baptized and then they say God what's next and he says forsake yourself I'm good um [Music] no I'm not doing that no I'm not forsaken I'm not forsaken anything you know how long I've been in church I'm not forsaken I'm about ready forsake to know I've been doing it for a long time God said nobody asked you about your resume and how long you have been sacrificed I gave you the strength to even do what you're already doing I'm not here to entertain when it is your season I'm here to tell you when your season is we keep thinking that we are a part of harvest time and and I mean a sea time and harvest and God's saying I'm not interested in you letting me know where you are I'm interested in letting you know where I am jump on board or jump off you know I you know Pastor I got it's just been a lot going on and I can't you know I can't do this you know I just I can't you can't do what Jesus because is is because it's it because if you can't be a pathway then here's the thing God can't use you to be a blessing some of you have worked like crazy to get where you are and you get frustrated because you're not always seeing the dividend of where you're going and then you look at someone else who seems like they're easy breezy and you don't know that all they're doing is being obedient to what God has already spoken over their life and you're trying to work hard and every blessing that God has for you to open up the doors for what you need is standing right there and God is saying if you would just follow me I already had the door open but since you're trying to do seven other things to make sure you get in so that you can solidify for yourself who you are I just want to let you know keep working that way that's probably another 10 years God speaks to me and says hey I want to take you somewhere he's like I got you in six months if you really obey me I do it in six weeks and you're trying to figure out why God is taking so long and God is saying because you will not forsake all other things I'm trying to transform your way of thinking because your thinking doesn't allow you to be able to conquer or take in the Harvest that I have for you here's the thing Joseph had a dream the problem is is that in Joseph's stream Joseph was not mature enough in his thinking to be able to fulfill the dream that God has for him David was anointed king but David was not anointed his anointing was enough to mature him to where he needed to be yes you are God's man yes you are God's woman but you need to be positioned where God has for you to be so that you can take in more here I'm going to get in real trouble with this one and I'm just going I'ma say it and then we go after and y'all go after God not me all right the Bible says Harvest is plentiful labor is a few context of a laborer is someone who knows they're going to work and will be tired here's what we do Harvest is plentiful the employers are many not the laborers because laborers understand tiredness is a part of walking through the forsaking stage [Applause] many of us are trying I love it listen listen listen I made a millennial I made the millennial Group by one year so I declare it I'm a millennial and I don't care what you say Wikipedia gave it to me 81 it says it 1981. I'm in there I don't care what you tell me I am in there and for all you Millennials that's trying to keep me out guess what I don't care I'm there so for us millennials [Applause] I don't know about the other groups as Millennials we find ourselves in a state where everything is now about self-care and we have a broken concept of self-care because we're doing self-care for ourself not for ourself to be who God's called for us to be it's like you better take care of you because if you don't take care of you you don't have anything else and once you are gone there's no other you here's the thing you get to heaven and don't have the purpose fulfilled out that God called you to do all your self-care in the world is going to sit you right at the gate and God's gonna be sitting there like so what did you do well I was on self-care time because I had to make sure I was good God said I didn't ask you about being good I called you to this Earth for a purpose hear how I can help you real quick you are here as a part of a plan to solve a problem that's what gives you purpose did you really think God created you so you could live for you there will be so many of us that come before God that is going to be at a broken place that God says what did you do with the life I've given you he was like I was just trying to be as comfortable as I could taking care of myself and he says now now and back then the Harvest is plentiful the laborers a few because no one's expecting to be tired for what God is walking them through everyone's expecting to be at a hey hey hey hey not too much not too much God that's why God is not even asking you to go anymore because he knows you won't leave your comfort [Applause] God let me give you my weeks that I'm available first week in the third week 12 to 1. [Music] I got that if you can't fit in that space it's gonna cost you more God and in order for me to move from that space God's saying I I want to get you out of this world thinking and get you into Kingdom thinking because if I can get you into Kingdom thinking somebody say Kingdom thinking it means that I no longer think the same way of the world which means that there is a wisdom and a Clarity and understanding that we start walking in here is what I'm scared about us as millennials is that while we're going to be some of the most skilled people will be some of the less people that have the least amount of wisdom and understanding here here's what I know what our generation to suffer from this idea that the generation before failed but here's where we're going to get it wrong the next generation won't have any substance to get from you [Applause] so they'll be asking you how do I how do I get into a relationship and hold it oh I don't know girl because I can't get mine well how do I hold a marriage I don't know I can't get married but we've been together 17 years I think y'all I think I think that's common common I think you're married you know I think I think according to the states you're married I think I think that's here's what here's what's going to happen it is going to be a group that has missed the responsibility of what forsaken brings and that is the idea of discipline that is the idea of hearing the voice of God that is the idea of moving in God's favor and that is the idea of not working out of themselves I've seen the miraculous happen in my life because God has moved you've seen things happen in your life because you have made the decision that I'm going to force it to happen and if it doesn't then I'll quit God says I need you to forsake second stage is the forming stage this is the stage where God's got to work you out of you anybody anybody know you got a lot of you in you can anybody like seriously a lot of you got a lot of you you got here's the problem we know it we're so smart in this generation that we know our problems you can ask anybody sitting next to you what's your issue well let me tell you some stuff about me say wait wait a minute let me start walking down the list let me tell you some stuff about me I don't like being with people but the reason I don't like being with people is that because I need time to myself because I'm a Sagittarius excuse me excuse me you're a what I'm a Sagittarius nobody gives about the month that you're in because you know when the stars are line up of the devil of the devil of the hush up hush up that's foolishness and that's what we're allowing to crawl control the way in which we're thinking and we don't have God that's in the front seat we have this idea that I'm in the front seat and my my sign controls me because you know these two signs can't go together and I'm sitting here saying have you ever read your Bible before no the reason we got to uproot this stuff is because this is the stuff we're telling each other and we're living by and we're unwise generation the Bible says they have ears but they cannot hear they have eyes but they cannot see he's like I'm trying to tell you it's getting worse the more you look at it and it's like no no we good this is my opinion God says it's impossible I'm trying to form you Philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says this for it is not your strength but it is God who is effectively at work in you here's what I want you to underline people don't like scripture but I gotta give it both to Will and to work that is strengthening energizing and creating in you the longing and the ability to fulfill your purpose for oh for who no for who for his good pleasure for his good pleasure he's trying to form create make will you to do to grow through strengthening and energizing all of these things that come from him for his good pleasure so how are you allowing God to form you because when he forms you he makes you when he makes you he puts you into place here's what I'm going to tell you real quick some of you got his place right here and he's saying cool I've established some things in this stage of your life to form you to form people to connect you and you're like God I just want to do church I want to do a whole bunch of people right now I got to get me together and self-care God says but but you but you're missing deforming and all you're doing is trying to form yourself and I want to form you what's the best way to form the best way to form is with a little bit of friction with a little bit of force with a little bit of pressure somebody said pressure um it's some pressure anybody know we run from pressure is anybody I like no we do you run from pressure yeah I run from pressure because I don't like pressure why because pressure makes me responsible and accountable for doing something about where I am and if I have pressure then it means I've got to make a change in who I am and where I am and I'm here today to let you know is that the change is for your good but it's the forming stage tell somebody don't leave the forming Sage forming stage is where you got to follow up forming stage is where you got to tell people where you're at the forming stage is where you got to give accountability to the people who don't like rolling with you you know you don't hang with you all the time four mistakes is when you got to make the call say Hey listen real quick I need some prayer is everything all right no it is not the forming stage this is the stage where you really want to quit why because it hurts the most why because it's changing who you are why because it now puts you in position to say God could you possibly use me the forming stage is the stage right before God's about to explode in your life it's that Sage where you like I'm about to quit anybody anybody been there any don't you have to put anybody there anybody anybody feel like you live there you you just constantly in the you're like I'm about to quit every day every day I'm quitting Pastor I quit right now you don't even know it but I've already quit I might start back up but I'm already quit right now I'm quick I've quit you know I don't I ever been there before you just like hey I I gotta get out of this because it's too much God says I want to let you know I didn't just make you a conqueror I made you more than a conqueror I gave you every tool that you need I've given you everything that you could possibly think I'm here to let you know if you could just hold on just a little while longer I would be forming you some of you said I'm at my Breaking Point God said you don't even know what your breaking point is I'm giving you exceeding and abundantly more than you could ask her or think give me more money give me more time give me more responsibility I'll be your flow I'll beat your pathway oh God use me I don't care I'll cry I'll be tired give me a couple hours of sleep but use me I've got too many people saying that because everybody's looking for a comfort place and a larger amount to be able to get you can't handle any more than what you're already doing you're at a Breaking Point and God says I can't do that more with you because you're already a Dead Sea why he get loud wake you up and then just real quick it was a tactic I used you woke up like yes Jesus yes that's all right it's all right it's all right but if you oh it cannot say if you really had to stand against some of the true things that God is holding back just to save your place do you know how many people are hungry for where you are if they could just get an opportunity to get in your day what listen how much they doing it I take zero if you just give me an open door and I'm opportunity you're gonna do what you're going to make me over a nation you're going to bless my Heritage you're going to bless my legacy you'll take God has said I would do it if if I move you out the way you don't know there's seven people already lined up there are folk lined up for you not to perform yes you think you listen I think I'm the special one dude you know how quick gotta be like you don't want to do it no all right cool let me open this up real quick and you and we're taking it granted here's the thing where leadership has gotten broken leadership has gotten broken because we're scared to feel the discomfort of letting some things go that's not just church that's business some of us don't want the new way in which we're going which requires a new transition which requires a reforming to get to where we're supposed to go which means you got to let some people go to get some people that you have that God has coming for you sometimes you gotta open the pathway yeah I want this you know what no that's okay you know what we'll do without that this time and I'd be sitting there like did they do that and that's where people say people hurt me no no I just understand that you're not at a forsaking or forming stage so I can't use you because the next stage that we're coming up to is the stage that's called the fruition stage where God moves abundantly or more than you can even think or ask every time you just begin to walk you don't understand how you're walking through the doors how God is putting you in places that you've never seen you are humble when you first started you know what you you were very grateful when you first started You Had a Heart of Thanksgiving when you first started but now that you're in it you think you all that you think you got it all together you think you're in the place where things are greater than what you got God said I will move you out the way he told them if you don't praise me I'll get the rocks to cry out I just want to tell you today I am great everybody grateful God don't move me don't take me out of position just allow give me one more chance I got this thing I'll be grateful again I'll be humble again I walk in your presence again I'll kneel I'll worship whatever it takes just use me just use me don't you dare get above God don't you dare think your gifting is so skilled and so collected that God will God will take everything you got and shift you right onto the side and say you know what I'll position you right here and you'll stay good where you are and you'll constantly stay good right there just keep going around in the same Circle doing the same thing looks like brand new people but God's like no because you wouldn't forsake other things because you wouldn't lay it down because you couldn't walk away from it and you wouldn't stay with me you wouldn't be like a tree planted by the rivers of water he says guess what then guess what the fruition stage will be right where you are [Music] so some of us have become comfortable with Where We Are we say this is it God said I never intended it that way but all I can do is show you I'll show you where you're going I'll show you where you could be

neighbor real quick stay in position stay in position don't be all over the place don't be doing everything with everybody else don't go everywhere stay in position I'm waiting why are you still standing there I'm just waiting it's coming [Music] I was sitting in the bed last night if I could just share this real quick sin praises the Lord and I told my wife something just something fell on me heavy and I knew the enemy was trying to weigh me nothing was wrong and I wasn't accepting depression I said I just feel awake I said in this moment I don't feel motivated In This Moment I don't feel all together in this moment I don't feel adequate I said that I said In This Moment I just don't have it and I'll never forget the Lord said this is your forming stage I said well God this day's gonna feel good he's like yeah it's not supposed to because if you don't walk through this you'll never know what it feels like to get through something you don't like our desire is to always satisfy the place that we're in without the addiction or the thing or the person or the problem is and here's what I heard the Lord say sit there and feel it I said what he says sit there and feel don't you call a person don't you text don't you tell nobody don't you find somebody to hook up with don't you find a person to call and you'll be like listen a minute he said I need to be your everything so I sat there nothing to fill the void no activity no post [Music] no social media no person he said now watch what my presence will do and I begin to feel the Holy Spirit fill my room and I just begin to worship and let's say I said I know you're here even inwardly I don't feel like you're here and I told the Lord I said in this moment I want you to make me can I can I be real honest real quick y'all I won't end I promise I said to the Lord I won't be no punk I said wait a minute what are you talking about I said I'm tired of being a punk to the enemy always giving in to what I feel in the moment I said if you know what I said if if the holy spirit is real and I got it I need it now you said in my weakness your strength is made perfect then I need you to do it now cause I'm weak and I'm broken and I don't feel it and if this thing is real and you want me to go on stage and tell somebody else that this thing works I need you to do it for me now and immediately the presence of the Lord began to fill the room and my inside didn't change but I knew the outside did because I felt a shift in the atmosphere and I just begin to praise God even though I didn't feel like see I'm trying to get you to a place where you no longer considering what you feel like it's a responsible party to get you where you're going you are truly trusting and depending on the holy spirit so I said holy spirit have your way and the spirit of God began to move in the place and I just begin to sit there I said I don't feel it he said it's not for you to feel it's for you to trust by faith I'm doing this thing that's what passion offering is about it's by faith that I believe in what God said it's already yes and amen so that's what I did and I sat there I sat there and then he brought this to me as I the Lord did not resolve my emotion that night and the scripture said weeping may in door for a night I said what kind of foolishness is this you're not gonna make me feel better he said no cause I'm not the god of your feelings I'm the god over your life I said so I'm gonna make you sit in the feelings why I still have victory in the moment I said what are you so I got the scripture said whipping may endure for a night I didn't feel better all night not all night I woke up this morning [Music] I said what is this [Music] I said wait something changed he said Joy Joy comes in the morning I said what he said Joy comes in the morning I'll take you through and sustain you Joy comes in the morning and the morning I woke up I said hey babe how you doing she said you're doing much better today I said yeah I'm doing good how you feeling and I woke up and I said that's what you did you showed yourself to be true by the way you worked yourself in my life not because you changed the way that I feel now but you sustained me kept me and then took me took me over the Bible says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for you are with me so at night when I was sleeping in the enemy thought he was going to win I could just feel the Lord saying I got you don't you worry about this my rod and my staff they'll comfort you through the night they'll watch over you during the day they'll be with you and I said Lord take me through so I can prove of your testimony it's passion all free it's passion Sunday the work of God will go further in this church because of what he's doing in your life how well I can do what I'm doing it's about how well that people can see the testimony of God over your life I believe this today that your position for next just tell your neighbor you're positioned tell your other neighbor you're positioned tell your third choice you are positioned so don't move because God has something in store for you today I believe that can we thank God for the word today [Music]
