that will remind us about having faith in god while getting us back into the routine of going to school this week we are talking about how we can face our fear when we are scared going back to school can be very scary deciding to follow jesus and do the right thing when our friends don't can also be very scary sometimes i get scared when i go to a new place or meet new people or even start a new activity well let's listen to the story of daniel he knew exactly how it felt to be scared take a look god's story daniel so part of god's story is about a guy named daniel and it goes like this daniel was a jew which means he was part of god's special family but when he was a young man a king called nebuchadnezzar let's call him nezer came in from the city of babylon and took over he chose the smartest strongest most handsome jewish men to leave their home and come work for him in his palace one of those young men was daniel even though most people in babylon didn't follow god daniel and his friends did so they had to figure out how to obey god and serve the king for starters they had to go through a training program where they were fed royal food the problem was king nezer had also offered that food to idols or false gods and since they followed god they wanted nothing to do with idols so daniel had an idea he asked the chief of the king's staff of he and his friends could eat vegetables and water for 10 days instead if they got too weak or skinny they'd eat something else well guess what god made them even stronger than the men who ate royal food god gave daniel extra understanding too in fact a few years later the king had a nightmare nobody knew what it meant daniel told king nezer that he would ask god to show him god did after that king nezu adored daniel he even said god was pretty great which was a big deal because the king didn't even think about god before that but soon he made it hard for daniel to follow god again that's because the king built a huge gold statue of himself 90 feet tall anybody who didn't bow down to it would be thrown into a furnace this time daniel's friends were the ones in trouble their names were shadrach meshach and abednego they told the king the god whom we serve is able to save us but even if he doesn't we will never worship the gold statue you've set up so they got sent into the fire well pretty soon the king looked into the furnace and noticed that there were four men and they were walking around an angel of the lord was protecting daniel's friends they got out alive and didn't even smell like smoke god didn't stop them from getting punished but he did go through it with them the king had never seen a god who would rescue like that afterwards king nezer didn't mind if daniel and his friends worshiped god but the king still worshiped idols too so god sent him another dream and daniel told him what it meant king nezer would live in a field and eat grass like a cow for seven years in other words he'd go crazy until he realized that god is the only one we should worship kids god doesn't want everybody to worship whoever they want he wants everybody to worship him anyway daniel kept working for other kings of babylon even after king nezer god continued to help him understand dreams and visions and even though he had to give a lot of bad news daniel did excellent work and he was really well liked by the kings in fact one king named darius liked daniel so much that others got jealous they tried to get daniel in trouble but they knew the only way to do that was to make a law against god they suggested that everybody pray only to king darius that made the king feel important so he made it a law disobeyed would spend the night in a den of lions daniel kept right on praying though and when king darius found out he was sad he didn't want to punish daniel but now it was the law he said may your god whom you serve faithfully rescue you and guess what god did he sent an angel to shut the lion's mouths daniel served four important kings and he followed god but whenever it came down to obeying god or the king daniel chose god every time no matter what and even though daniel had to do some really hard things god was always with him and that's the story of daniel so in case you missed it here's the quick version daniel was taken to babylon he asked for vegetables god made him strong god gave daniel understanding daniel's friends obeyed god instead of the king they got punished god rescued them daniel understood more dreams he was the king's favorite others got jealous daniel obeyed god instead of the king he got punished god rescued him daniel served god no matter what and that's a part of god's story [Music] daniel had a scary scary slumber party with lions and was thrown into fire but god protected him and he was not hurt that shows us that god wants us to pray when we are scared and that god will help us and get us through scary times deciding to do the right thing in school while others may not can be hard because we don't want to be teased about friends but this is when god wants us to pray and ask him to help us it is also a time to remember that god is always with us we do not have to be afraid the bible tells us that god is our safe place our strength and will help us when we feel scared lonely or hurt now help me with this week's memory
