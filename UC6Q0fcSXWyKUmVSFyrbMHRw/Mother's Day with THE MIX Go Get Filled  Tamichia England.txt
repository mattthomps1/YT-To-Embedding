[Music] well we're here it's mother's day and and i'm eager to get into god's word so if you have your bibles open them if you have your pen and paper let's take some notes we like to say here at the mix that note takers are and readers are i love it i love it so we know exactly what to do and today we're going to come from the book of john and we're going to read john chapter 4 verse 3 verse 13. i'm sorry and it says this jesus answered everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water i give them will never thirst indeed the water i give them will become in them a water a spring of water welling up to eternal life lord thank you for this word lord allow for all of those who can hear my voice god to open up their hearts and open up their minds to be able to receive whatever it is that you're trying to say today god allow for us to be hearers and doers of your word and it's in your name jesus christ that we pray amen i've been a chaser all of my life i've been a chaser of dreams a chaser of goals acceptance money success love good things and to be honest not so good things i was a tree i chased that early on i had a longing desire to be fulfilled but had no clue of what that meant i figured that as long as i fulfilled my desire i would be complete the crazy thing is is that after all of that temporary fulfillment i still had a void thank you lord which kept me in the cycle of seeking fulfilling and feeling empty have you ever felt like that before just been in a cycle of just going and going and going and yet ending up nowhere what i've learned is no earthly longing no amount of chasing or looking for the next best thing no perfect diet the furries-hair relationship or reaching your goals will ever truly satisfy we've all been there we get new things we get bored on to the next and the cycle continues of seeking fulfillment fulfillment and feeling empty and oftentimes those things lead to addiction and obsessive behaviors and so we're there we get there and we're like looking at ourselves in the mirror like how did we get here how did i get here i never meant for it to get this far i never meant to go too far to the left or too far to the right all i wanted was a little something to take the edge off all i wanted was to feel loved all i needed all i wanted in that moment was an opportunity to be seen to feel and then we end up in in destructive relationships we end up with these these habits that we never intended to be a part of our lives and so we remain in a cycle of seeking fulfillment and emptiness and then we the enemy tells us that we're so far away from god because of our cycle that we just stay there and we feel like we're hopeless we feel like we'll never be able to to live up to what god's expectations are and we stay there so far away from god so broken but yet in the same cycle of unfulfillment can i tell you that there's a hole so deep in our lives a longing so great that can only be quenched by one thing and that is god himself a hole that seems to be easily masked and the longing for more of whatever earthly thing you believe will satisfy and sometimes you know we we we're in these cycles and we say things like this i've said it i don't know if you've said it maybe it's just me but i'm like lord if you would just take the desire if you would just take the taste out of my mouth jesus i promise i'll be what you call for me to be like we're literally like pleading and begging and pleading and begging but guess what we don't change we're still stuck in the cycle because although we're saying it we don't believe it we're too far gone right that's what we tell ourselves and then you know we're asking god if you why would you give me this desire why would you give me this longing but can i tell you that the the longing and desires that's not the problem that's not that's not a bad thing god gives us a desire for things that we need for instance i don't know if any of you have asthma have kids with asthma if you um ever had to take a test where you had to hold your breath i know for me i take one once a year and they tell me to breathe and then they snapped the picture and then i'm like oh cause i feel like i'm gonna like pass out right and once i take that breath of fresh air i feel like okay all right i'm alive i can breathe so it's not a bad thing because our bodies long for air that's the way that god desire designed us we long for oxygen i don't know about you but sometimes i get this little monster in my stomach and he's fighting and he's growling right and as soon as i give him what he wants which is some food he calms down so the longing isn't bad the desires aren't bad but it's what we do when we what's the desires and the longings maybe the longing for more isn't a bad feeling but a necessary one designed inside of us to keep us running back to the one who can fill us what if that longing we desperately try to fill is our daily reminder to keep seeking god letting the longing be the reminder to go and get filled so today's the title of today's message is go get filled if you were waiting for one you got it we're gonna bounce around a little bit in the book of john chapter four because i believe that there's a lot of good nuggets left for us in this chapter so the chapter begins with jesus resting at jacob's well in samaria in a town called the car because he had been traveling and he was very very tired from his journey and the bible says that it was about noon i put that in there for for a reason and then here comes a samaritan woman to come she went to the well to draw water and let me say it again it was about new i don't know about you guys but i don't know because samaria was like a desert town which meant it was hot so this woman traveling in the desert at noon to go and fill her water jars the thing about it was that women in that area either they want to fill their jars at sun rise or even sunset they never ever went in the heat of the day so this woman went to the well at 12 noon in the heat of the day now let me pause i love the summer summer is like my favorite season i don't know if you all have children or have looked at the movie frozen right and they had he has the character but it's a curse about the name of olaf and he's a snowman and he loves summer so he's singing his song about all the things that he's going to do in summer not even realizing that in summer your snow you will melt however he loves summer and so at the end of his song he yells it's summer and so for me that's how i feel like i'm a nature watcher so during the spring i'm looking the trees are starting to bud and flowers are coming up and the grass is growing and i'm telling my husband it's almost here summer is almost here and so i have so many things for us to do because that's what we do as women right we plan we're like we're going on a vacation we're gonna have day dates we're gonna go to brunch we're gonna do this we're gonna do that and so i'm planning all of these activities for us to do and then that 90 degree 100 degree day calm and it's saturday and usually my husband is out he's running errands and he's getting a car wash that sort of thing he comes back and he's like well baby it's hot out there i'm like like hot or hot hot he like like you can't breathe hot so i'm like oh so i go to my phone check the weather so it's 100 degrees with a heat index of like one million you know how they do like it's hot so i say this phrase and if you can catch it you can say it with me i'll say babe you know what let's go when the sun goes down yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i love summer but you're not going to catch me doing anything in the desert in the heat of the day i want to be underneath the air conditioning i want to be drinking some ice cold water some lemonade or something but in the heat i will not be and so this woman she went to the well in the heat of the day alone and i was thinking well at least she could have took her good girlfriend with the these they could have been talking chopping it up talking about what's happening in the town something right but she goes to this wow alone on purpose she was avoiding something drawing water alone in the heat of the day could only indicate one thing that she was a social outcast have you ever been there have you ever been so extreme that at avoiding something that you look back at it today and be like why did i even ever do that like i i know i have one of the things that happened to me was that um in church right we all we talk about church hurt and things like that and so one thing that i can remember was somebody saying something to me and they're ignorant that changed my perception of god right i walked away from the church i walked away from god because i equated god to man i didn't separate god being god and man being man can i tell you that we all have imperfections even in church that we're all still on a journey and that we should never ever ever ever equate the god the lord our creator to man his creation it doesn't add up and so i look back at that moment as you know you grow in your relationship with christ and and you mature and you're really just trying to figure out like what is that thing to make me do to make me do this or what happened to make me do that and that was the very moment that thing right there but but i look back at it now and i say to myself i only walked away because i didn't know any better because i didn't have the kind of relationship that i needed with god at that moment you know the kind of relationship with god where he validates you your flaws and all that's the kind of god that we have that we should never ever let man or anything else define us or put us in any kind of box because they are a creation just like we are and they don't know what's best for us only our creator knows that so it's important for us to define what our relationship with god looks like so that we know his characteristics how can we how can we walk and honor and know who we are if we don't know the person that created us the one that created us and we can say it all day but yet and still we're hiding behind filters okay y'all know them snapchat filters they keep right i know i like the one that make you look all yellow and stuff like i like that's my favorite you know we hide behind all of these different things because we don't know who we are i find so many similarities in the story of this woman to my own so many ways i can relate to this samaritan woman who felt like she didn't add up she was lost in a sea of brokenness most likely living under the assumption that there was no fix for her she was too far gone yet jesus the loving father the messiah the savior of the world met her there he was sitting by the well asking for a drink john 4 7 says when a samaritan woman came to draw water jesus said to her will you give me a drink indicating this reality that in god's eyes no one is too far gone that he has purpose for each of us and that he will never ever ever let us be alone regardless of what other people might think that's the kind of god we serve a god that that loves us through our difficult moment a god that cares about those places that you don't even want to talk about those insecurities that we stuff in the bottom of our stomachs that only he knows about he's that kind of god that will be there when nobody else is there when when your good girlfriend or your homeboy reveals all your deepest darkest secrets and your outcasts god will be there right there with you in that moment and i believe that there are four things that we can learn from this woman this outcast this woman who felt like she was so far gone point number one she stayed with jesus john 4 11 and 12 says sir the woman said you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep where can you get this living water are you greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank it or drank from it himself as did his sons and his livestock see it would have been easier for her to leave to be so overwhelmed by her problems that she didn't even understand what jesus was asking she didn't run she didn't tune him out she pursued him and she asked questions she pursued him and she asks questions oftentimes we will sit with god right and we'll just we'll we'll thank him and you know we'll guide your great god and all of those things are good but we don't or ask some god if you could just pay this bill god if you can can just heal and all of those things are good but what about your day-to-day what about god what would you have for me to do today what my purpose what is my purpose today what should i eat today what should i drink today what should i speak out of my mouth today what should i listen to today oftentimes we we we're in this surface relationship with god and we we understand him as the god that heals and we understand him as the god that that provides but what about the the god that wants to be your friend the god that wants to be in every aspect in every area of your life i bet if we did that we will break the cycle of seeking unfulfillment and emptiness point number two she received his feeling john 4 and 15 says the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water she asked for his feeling sometimes we want to will it or wish it into existence you know you're just sitting there if god if only god would if only god could if only god should but we never ever go to him and be like god can you do this for me can you fill me with your spirit if it's speaking in tongues if it's if it's help if it's preaching if it's serving god can you fill me with whatever it is that you have for me can i tell you that he wants you to operate as a 10 today lacking nothing being deficient in nothing jesus offered and she accepted see jesus is always offering that is the one thing that we know that he offers us salvation truth feeling and a place to never thirst again but the question is will you receive it today will you just keep glossing over what your purpose is will you keep living in a cycle because it's so comfortable or will you break the cycle and ask god what would you have for me to do today the giving of jesus is guaranteed the receiving on our end is a stumbling block see receiving is hard especially when you believe you've gone too far perhaps you have had the faith enough to receive salvation but you're struggling to have faith enough to advance it maybe you were in church one day or you were listening to a sarah jake roberts message and and the call of salvation was offered and you was like yeah lord i you know i want to be saved i want your heart and it stopped there and after you gave your heart to god you literally literally something happened that kind of knocked you off your feet and you said oh no no no i thought with god life will be better can i tell you that life of god is better but but life is hard but with god is easier that we don't have to to carry the shame we don't have the car to build like the the um the burden we don't have to carry any of those things that we have a father that loves us and who's waiting to carry what we can't receiving is not a destination it's an action it's in receiving that our satisfaction is quenched we are designed to crave so why not satisfy our desires with the only one who can permanently fulfill and his name is he say that loud enough you act like you don't know what's his name jesus it's something about the name it should should make your inside shape it's not a moment that i i call out his name that i don't feel like some kind of hope being restored in the inside that's a powerful name point number three she was honest john 4 17 and 18 says i have no husband she replied jesus said to her you are right when you say you don't have no husband the fact is you have had five husbands and the one that you have now is not even your husband so what you said is quite true she was faced with the very thing that she had been avoiding the reason why she went to the well in the first place in the heat of the day she was being confronted with her sin yet she was open enough to share her shame with jesus and jesus acknowledged her sin and offered her freedom jesus disregarded social barriers meaning during that time men did not talk to women in public and the fact that she was a samaritan because jews did not talk to samaritans and the third one this woman had a reputation jesus knew but yet he still met her at the well he did this to offer this woman forgiveness redemption and new life see we need to be more like jesus we need to stop worrying about how deep a person is in sin and do everything we can to help them to help lead them to freedom we do things like gossiping about their sin i'm not talking about talking about it to help them toward freedom i'm talking about when you get in your groups and you're talking about what's what has been revealed with the intent to make this person a social outcast i'm talking about passing personal judgment if they do it like this or why would they do it like that and the only reason why we do things like that because we're trying to cover up what we got going on because when you are in a place and you know where you are none of us have arrived and we all have stuff then you'll be so focused on going to god about your stuff that you don't have time worrying about anybody else's stuff when my kids were smaller and they used to tell me about everything that everybody else did i would say and what did you do stop telling me about everybody else because i want to know the part that you played in it and this one can be a like a ouch moment categorizing sin we talk about the one that has children out of wedlock we can see their sin because we see the children and no ring or no commitment or we see those who are an addiction right we we see that in and we're talking about that but what about when we tend to overeat using food is our comfort instead of jesus what about when you make these huge purchases right just to to feel validate validated among those in your circle when we know that validation comes from god or obtaining every certification or every degree known to man so that when you show up in a room you feel accepted it's nothing wrong with degrees there's nothing wrong with eating there's nothing wrong with purchases it's just what we we use those things to replace the things that only god can fulfill point number four she desired to go and do john 4 28 and 29 says and we're also going to jump to verse 39 then leaving her water jar the woman went back to the town and said to the people come see a man who told me everything i ever did did could this be the messiah many of the samaritans from the town believed in him because of the woman's testimony he told me everything i ever did see here's the thing we tell people all kinds of stuff all day us girls you know we sex is having a good sale neiman's nordstrom you know oh you've been watching this this is on sale that's on sale and we'll like you know put it in chats and we'll be sending coupon codes and all kinds of stuff that's just how we roll because everybody like a snail especially us girls because we like a lot of stuff or here's the thing oh you know such and such opened up girl they got the best brunch cause you know we love brunch we love day brunch lunch brunch night brunch we just love the brunch if it's brunch then i may i love me a good brunch we'll share those things that aren't bad things but can i tell you that those things don't bring about life change they bring about temporary fulfillment and yet jesus does something in the inside of us he changes our lives forever and we go into our environments into our communities into our neighborhoods and we're sitting with our mouth closed as if we don't know any better and we say things like well i don't want to be too churchy well we say things like i don't want to offend nobody's religion can i tell you that when the lord of lords the king of kings come into your heart and you have a true encounter with him that relationship with him is something that you can't put on his shelf pick it up and put it down when you when it's convenient for you it doesn't work that way if it's in you it's in you it's going to be in you at church it's going to be in you at work it's going to be in you when you're at brunch it's going to be with you at all times i remember a time when when god i don't know if he was like literally saying this but i remember many of you know that we have an early learning center on the west side of baltimore and i had this family and at our center we are adamant about speaking life over our children we celebrate holidays we celebrate christmas we celebrate easter but with without we tell them the real meaning of these holidays we have to tell them who they are and and who they belong to because don't you know that that children experience ptsd children get sad children have real life stuff going on and so it's our responsibility to make sure that we're speaking life over these children along with their parents so they can grow up to be well-rounded individuals and so this family they were of another religion and and she came and she said can i talk to you for a minute i say yeah you know what's up she said well at night my children they're saying thank you jesus and and at the table before they eat they're saying thank you jesus and everything is thank you jesus and i'm saying okay what's the problem she said well the problem is is that we don't believe in jesus and i would prefer if when you're talking about your jesus you exclude my children i said ma'am i would not be able to do that let me get you discharged papers immediately because i was not willing to to like sacrifice the god in me not when i know how far he's brought me because he's not a god that i should put down and pick up when it's convenient even when finances are involved because you know we get a little touchy about our coins you know when i was sitting in the back of my head as we were talking i was like yeah well you know that's two kids that's gonna be done and underdone it means i'm gonna have to cut it here cut it and god says so what am i not your provider [Applause] and can i tell you that this was on a monday by thursday i had a family calling said saying i have a set of twins and an additional child do you have space [Music] and can i tell you from that point going forward and that has been about six years that our center has been full during covet that we never shut down that we never had a case of covet can i tell you that we have a waiting list and this is without advertisement you never ever have to worry about will god do it he'll do it but you have to open up yourself to be able to receive it this point right here point number four was the most exciting to me because not only was this woman fulfilled she had the desire to go out so that others could experience what she was experiencing that's what god is calling us to do he's calling for us to get healed he's calling for us to be free so that we can go out and free others why would you want to keep your mouth shut so what about a brunch so what about a a bag i mean although i love those things but so what because guess what the new bag is gonna come out the new shoes are gonna come out somebody's gonna open up a bomb brunch spot and we'll be there sharing that but why not share the good news of jesus christ the one that fills the one that saves the one that redeems the one that heals the one that gives purpose the one that validates the one it comforts the woman at the wildling is an example of love truth redemption and acceptance we are not designed to fill from an empty cup for when we run dry we reach for an easy and often temporary source of comfort by choosing to live filled to receive his feeling daily allows for that to overflow in all aspects of our lives creating a well-lived relationship in christ alone let him do the work let him be your healer and your god come back to him daily for he is the living well he alone allows you to live well get filled and may you never thirst again
