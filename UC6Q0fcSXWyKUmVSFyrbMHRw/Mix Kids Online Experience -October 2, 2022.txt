everyone thank you so much for helping me to solve my crossword puzzle Jesus told a parable which is a story about the rich fool let's take a look [Music] stories of the Bible parable of the wealthy man this is Jesus hey oh who is the Son of God and the savior of the world while Jesus was on Earth he taught everyone about God's love he healed many people from their sickness performed many miracles like calming storms and even raised people from the dead wahoo one day a crowd gathered around Jesus to hear him talk the crowd was so big that people were stepping on each other hey watch it Jesus was talking to his disciples when someone called out from the crowd hey Josh teacher tell my brother to divide with me the property Our Father left us ah hold on there she said friend who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that be careful and guard against all kinds of greed a man's life is not measured by the many things he owns huh then he told them a story a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should I do I don't have room for all my crops I got it then he said I know I'll tear down my Barns and build bigger ones then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods and I'll sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come [Music] now take it easy eat drink and be merry but God said to him you fool you will die this very night wait what then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up Earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God [Music] material things of this earth like toys trees houses and cars only are temporary they may last a long time for you or for me but they will never last forever eventually they will be destroyed by water Wind Fire Sun or just age so if we store our Treasures on Earth we are kind of wasting our time because they won't last but by building up our relationship with God and by doing his will here on Earth we are storing about Treasures in Heaven that will last forever before we go let's sing and dance to deep deep deep by happy children [Music] and so much more [Music] Lord show me what you
