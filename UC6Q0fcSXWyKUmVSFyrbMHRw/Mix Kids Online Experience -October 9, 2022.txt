[Music] [Music] thank you [Music] good morning guys welcome to mix kids we are so happy that you are watching with us today we will learn about a rich man who lived to please his sinful nature giving little to any thought to spiritual things or the needs of others upon the rich man's death he is horrified to find himself in a place of Terror torment or distress how often do you drink milk how can we tell if the milk inside the container has gone sour one way to tell if the milk is spoiled will be to open the container to taste it or we could use our nose to sniff the milk the manufacturers decided to help us out and place our expiration date on the container so when you're looking at your milk and you see these numbers these dates that means this is the expiration date so it tells you if the milk is good or not wouldn't it be wasteful to buy a jug of milk and then leave it sitting on the shelf unused until the expiration date has passed things this side of Heaven only last so long this includes us as well as the milk we were just disgusting once we expire or once we leave this herb to be with God in heaven we are no longer useful in the world we need to make sure that we get off the shelf so to speak and diligently use the time God has given us when we use the time God has given us to obtain Earthly treasures and spoil ourselves Treasures that will last just a short time or we use our time here on Earth wisely using the talents God has given us to make an impact on eternity our memory verse for this week says whoever sows to please their flesh from the flesh will reap destruction whoever sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life Galatians 6 and 8. now let's take a look at a story about a man that was rich and selfish welcome to Holy Tales I guess you are all here to listen to another Parable from the Bible you are correct have you decided which Parable you're going to tell us today today I am going to tell you the story about the rich man and Lazarus [Music] sounds interesting go on with the story holy can't wait okay okay once they're left a rich man who wore fine purple colored clothes in those times purple was the most expensive dye and therefore seen mostly on Nobles rich people royalty and sometimes on High level officials every day this rich man would eat Splendid meals wearing his purple robe he never had to worry about anything in life he thought everything could be bought with money and he had everything coming to him very easily outside the rich man's house lived a beggar his name was Lazarus he was hungry and more torn clothes he had sores all over his body he would come there every day hoping to find some leftover food from the rich man but the rich man ignored him and never cared or offered him food one night Lazarus died that same night the rich man died too the angels from heaven took Lazarus to Abraham's side of the heaven while the rich man's Eternal resting place was in hell when the rich man saw Lazarus on Abraham's Side of Heaven he was confused he did not understand what he did in his lifetime to receive such suffering and pain after death he pleaded to Abraham let Lazarus come down and cool me off by dipping his finger in cold water and putting it on my tongue I want to be relieved of all this pain that I am going through Abraham spoke to the rich man during your lifetime you received many good things while on the other hand Lazarus received nothing but suffering this was because of no fault of this but he did and you did nothing to help him out also there's too much distance between Lazarus and you it is impossible for Lazarus to help you in any way the rich man cried and begged please please please help me where were you when you could have helped Lazarus did you ever think of helping him when he sat outside your house every day waiting for you to give him some food and now after death Lazarus deserves all the comfort and love he was ignored of in his life the rich man so he hit Abraham and said please can you send back Lazarus to my five brothers so that he can go warn them to change their lives Abraham was happy that the rich man was finally being unselfish and thinking about others over himself but he also knew that sending back Lazarus would not help his brothers in any way so he said to the rich man you think your brothers would believe Lazarus even if he went back from the dead and told them they are not willing to listen to Moses and the prophets so why do you think they would listen to a simple man like Lazarus the rich man understood what Abraham was trying to say he had no way of redeeming himself or help his brothers who were living a selfish life just as he had so what did Jesus try to tell through the story holy freckles you tell me and I stink what Jesus was trying I know I know Jesus was trying to show people that like the rich man's Brothers even the people would mock God's messenger Jesus himself and even if he died and returned they would still not believe Moses and the prophets well done tubby all right then so I guess all you children have understood the story and I hope you liked it so stay [Music]
