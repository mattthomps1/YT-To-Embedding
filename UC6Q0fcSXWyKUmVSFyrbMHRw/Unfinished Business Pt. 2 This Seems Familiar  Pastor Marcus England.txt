foreign that is tuning in across the world to be with us today we're in our scripture first Samuel chapter 30 first Samuel chapter 30 and it reads this it says now when David and his men came to ziklag on the third day the amalekites had made a raid against the negeb and against ziklag it said they had overcome ziklag and burnt it with fire and taken captive the women and all who were in it both small and great they killed no one but carried them off and went their way and when David and his men came to the city they felt it burnt with fire and their wives and Sons and Daughters taken captive it says then David and the people who are with Him raise their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weed that's somebody in this place today you've been weeping so much that you don't even have any fight left in you but I just want to tell somebody today don't quit now God is up to something verse 5 says David's two wives also had been taken captive a Hino him and Jezreel and Adam Gail the Widow of nabel of Carmel and David was greatly distressed but the people spoke of stoning him because all the people were bitter in soul each for his sons and daughters but somebody say but but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God and David said to abayathar the priests the son of the himelect bring me the ephod so abayathon brought the ephod to David and David inquired of the Lord and this is what he acts shall I pursue after this ban shall I overtake them he answered him pursue for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue I want to come from the message title today this seems familiar this seems familiar can we pray father in the name of Jesus we thank you for this moment we thank you for this opportunity and the time that you've given us father I pray that you would use me as an instrument to deliver your forward God let us have open ears to hear but not just to be heroes but doers of your word in Jesus name we declare somebody say Amen in this place come on help me give it up for our amazing dream team in this place hallelujah thank you so much musicians I think about this because I I I I think about this word because there's a connection with the word David memorizing and thinking through his life remembers this season I feel like oftentimes we remember the worst seasons of our life than we do the best seasons I remember oftentimes I think that we we think about the times when things went bad versus the times when things went well and oftentimes we can spend our moments and our days fixated on the things that did not go the way we thought they should go but you must remember there's a moment there's a time there's a there's a there's a season where where even though you were going through a lot God was moving on your behalf anybody ever been there before you remember where things were just all over the place you could not get your mind together you could not understand why God was doing what he was doing but the truth of the matter is is that you understand that even those things were hard God still is in control can anybody ever understand that moment that even in the midst of some of the most Hard Times God is still in control anybody ever been there before anybody know that God is still in control anybody know in anxiety that God is still in control anybody know at the worst moments of your life when you feel inadequate and don't feel like you have it all together air is still a declaration that God is in control can you tell your neighbor real quick God's in control because oftentimes if you forget that God is in control all you can see is what's not in control and you lose the focus of understanding that what God has been setting up it's all for the purpose of his good now I can tell you something today is that life can be hard can I get an amen the Lord knows life can have its moments Lord knows that life can be life oh it knows that people can be people and Lord knows situations can be situations but in the midst of everything I want to let you know that God is always fully in control here's how I know because of growth in time has taught me that God is still in control here's where you question God's control when you are still in the same place you were a couple years ago you ever been there before you you find yourself doing the same thing operating the same way still living out the same things and you're wondering to yourself is God moving or not the truth of the matter is God's moving you're just not and so many times God's moving but we're not connected with the movement we're too consumed in our own time consumed in our own ways think we're killing it at life anybody ever been there before you're killing it so bad at life but the whole time you're missing God's move God's moving your life is about him using you to make an impact in the world and the only thing you've done in the last couple of years if I could just be honest sometimes the only thing we've done is moved our bank account or we have moved our residence or we have moved our living situation but we have not found ourselves moving any further than where we were last year we can have as many opportunities to do to go to hear we've heard every message sermon preached from Genesis to Revelations we have heard every encouraging word of where we are but the problem is is that there's hard possibilities that even though God calls us to be transformed we stay where we are we say doing what we do we say going where we're going and the progression of our life looks like this we progress according to the car that we buy you know last year I had a Kia this year I got a Mercedes God's moving in my life the problem is is that why God's moving in your life no one else is feeling the effect of the move and the effect of the move is supposed to impact so many great people the effect of your life changing it's supposed to impact more than you and your bank account over and over the impact of your life is supposed to affect the community but when you turn and look around with your eyes everything around you is still the same and it is a very much visible evidence that you are still to say Pastor I don't I don't need you telling me that I'm aware I was saying was placed last year well you're not at the same place you were last year you might be at the same place you were three years ago and I could be a hard one to swallow if you're just trying to figure out well why am I at the same place doing the same thing the reason being is because often times life seems like it's playing the same piece over and over again anybody ever going through a problem and say to yourself this seems familiar [Music] you ever been there before you looked at like I am back here again you ever told somebody I'm not going back to where I was I'm not listen I'm telling you I'm free I'm out of that space I'm out of that moment anybody ever been here before to just spend in a place where you say I am different and you look back again and you're looking at some of the same problems can anybody be honest with that stuck in the same way the enemy crippling your mind the same way and you're thinking out things the same way but here is what I want to let you know today there is some business that you have that's been unfinished and it's left you where you are because you haven't made the decision to pick up from where you left off so that you could fulfill the purpose and potential that God has in your life today you just decided I was gonna get a promotion I was just gonna get another car I was just gonna move to another house but the problem is is your potential is still untapped because you won't operate and say yes God to your purpose I'm here today to let you know today is the day that you might want to look at what God has for you and look at where God has you operating and look at where God has you moving because here's the thing your purpose is going to stay where it is until you become subject to God's will over your life you can keep getting promoted as high as the sky can go but in your promotion you will still find there's a sense of unfulfillment you will still find that there's a place that you keep going it doesn't matter who you connect with it doesn't matter how many more networking opportunities you have you will say to yourself why do I feel the same way and God is saying to you today I'm waiting on you let's tell your neighbor real sneaky the Lord's waiting on you you got say slow say it low though don't don't put their business out there just say it real low because idea you believe is that you're waiting on God and God says no I'm waiting on you I'm waiting on you to get it together to believe that what I said over your life is already yes and amen I'm waiting on you to believe that who I called you to be and the greatness that I have set over your life and what I have spoken over you and your children and your children's children shall come to pass I'm just waiting on you tell your second choice God's waiting on you not too loud don't expose them say it soft because the idea that you believe you are in the waiting face and God says I've been in a waiting Faith since I created you in your mother's womb matter of fact before that I was creating you in the back area before I even formed the earth I already knew what you were going to be but here's the issue that you keep Landing in is that you believe that God is waiting somewhere concerned with everyone else but not concerned with you you believe God's left you because the way that life looks it looks like God has over past you it looks like God skipped over you know how people play anybody ever play UNO before y'all know oh no y'all know when you're getting that oh no game and you look and you see what you got in your hand and you look in your hand and you like my goodness if if if this if you make me mad anybody know about those draw for us you looking at the person and you smile at them real simple you better be nice because if I get the opportunity and you upset me this new age Uno will have words come out your mouth you haven't said in a long time because when they put that stack on you and you somewhere drawn 65. [Laughter] your whole Spirit just changes now the draw for will get you and the draw two will get you but there ain't nothing like being ignored by a skip [Applause] it's disrespectful it means that you didn't even think that I was even worse the time to invest in it is nothing like a Skip and when you place the skip down the person begins to respond as if they're about to play and what do you have to do you have to remind them real quick excuse me not your turn I skipped and the person looks at you shot oh my God you've excluded me out of this round but there's nothing like watching the multitude be skipped there's nothing like a good stat skip you skip you and Skip you you you feel powerful all y'all skip Olio oftentimes that's what we feel like God's doing in our own space we feel like God has skipped us and we feel like God has ignored us and where we are with him we put ourselves in the mindset that God doesn't see me anymore and I'm here today to let you know God sees you just tell your neighbor real quick God sees you [Applause] but the problem is that it can be hard to trust God when it feels like God's not moving the scripture lets us know that David is at a place where he's been so rejected and dejected that he doesn't even understand what's happening David has just been rejected from his own enemies to fight against his own people oh how bad you have to be at a place in your life where the very people who wanted to destroy you won't even take your help it's something bad when the enemy sends his demons against you actually make a decision to start hanging with the demons and the demons saying no no no no you're not it's crazy when you can't even sin right because God's got so much purpose on your life you're jacking up sin making sin look bad people in the world like what are you doing I'm trying to get drunk that's not the way you do it [Applause] because when God's purposed and put a plan for your life you can't win unless you're in direct connection with him your sin looks jacked up the devil's probably saying you're making me look bad really I mean I sent this out here but you're making me look bad and you're saying I don't even understand David's saying y'all won't even take me to fight against my own people you reject me and so the Bible says on his way back to a foreign land a foreign land that almost 15 years ago God said he would rule it's something crazy when you've walked into the position that God sent you a lead yet you're the one still mopping and serving it's crazy when you walk into the position where God said this was going to be the best season of your life what God has anointed you and purpose you to do something more than you could imagine a thing and the only result of it right now is you feel like you're stuck you feel like God is against you and he's not for you you feel like there's an opportunity in a moment for God to be able to use you and somebody is saying right now in their prayer time God now is the time and in it the Lord's saying not yet hmm I don't like him not yet you know what I really don't like don't prophesy to me and don't let me go don't anoint me and then tell me you got years before you gonna do it the audacity that you would declare purpose over my life and then take me through process in the world why would you anoint me if I'm not ready because I want to let you know that I have a promise for you but even though the promise may not be fulfilled yet I just want to let you know you're already called to what God's called you to can I tell somebody today just take a minute and breathe and slow down and understand where you are is on purpose where God has you it's a season of your growing and you're learning because what he doesn't want you to do is go back to the same place that you are doing the same thing that you did he's trying to become understand that you will become a Victor in the place that you are and that you could actually fulfill the purpose that God has for your life but here's what we do we get anointed and we get arrogant you know you know he called me King right you know he he called you you understand how much money I'm about to make do you understand the level of where I'm about to be you want to get on board God says I'm calling you to a greater blessing than you could even imagine or think but just not right now the Bible says David gets to a place where he goes back home to zigglect ziglag is not even home it's a place outside of where he's supposed to be the Bible lets us know David is literally in the place where his greatest opponent Goliath came from he finds himself in the situation and where he gets back the Bible says that everything that David and his people is nothing like you losing your own stuff but it's something when people are connected to you and they lose out as well the Bible says David finds himself at a place where when they get back to ziglag there is no celebration for him there are no people clapping celebrating you know when you get home you want somebody to know your home you want somebody to be able to acknowledge even if it's Alexa Alexa I'm home it's good to see you but the idea is there's nobody there because everything that you felt like was security has left you the Comfort around you that you built so that you could be where you wanted to be operate how you wanted to operate have all the celebration that you wanted to have everything that you put as a support system around you is no longer there and the Bible says when you feel at least supported God's with you the Bible tells us he he finds himself at a place where they're weeping the Bible says they cried so much they cried so much that they were just tired anybody ever been there before and if I cry like be honest anybody ever wore yourself out in weary I mean you just worried so much you just cried so much you just were at the point where you said Lord if you just help me and you I mean you my mom's here I honor you today mother hey man amen but when I was young there were some moments in my life where I did not do as I was supposed to do those moments were met what the Bible says is called discipline the discipline was not numbers she did not count down backwards the numbers were a promise that when you get home [Laughter] the fire that Revelations talks about you shall feel after you get that beating you're in your room I don't know if you know about that room part but that room part is where you express all of your feelings you talk about the hate that you have you talk about the anger you sit in the roommate I swear I hate her I was so I was so mad I got my luggage and my Hulk Hogan and put it in that suitcase and said I'm out of this place problem is that I cried so much that when I got into bed to rest from crying I woke up the next day why because I was so weak from crying some of you I want to tell you today that weeping may endure for a night but there's a joy somebody say Joy somebody say Joy there is an entitlement that you should have to Joy weeping may endure for a night but when you wake up in the morning you've got to say to yourself Lord now you said it was only for a night I need what Joy this morning we being may endure Fortnight but joy comes in good morning I'm expecting something to change the Bible lets us know that when we get to this this point of of where things are it says that David and his men are so angry that they get to the point where they say we're gonna Stone them no we're gonna kill him because everything we entrusted to him he has let fall by the wayside they got so mad they stoned them you ever heard somebody any anybody ever been there before in school you knew you were about to fight but you were trying to act like you didn't know you were about to fight so you heard it but you ignored it in your ear because they was like yo we about to jump them and you be start talking to people unnecessarily hey how you doing like why are you in conversation with me hey right now I need friends I need people around me the Bible says David gets to the place but he he does something different that we don't know how to do as well these days the Bible says Point number one you got to learn to encourage yourself no real quick I need to help you with this because the the context of helping yourself can really become complicated and and the perspective of it is because when you when you encourage yourself most of us text somebody call somebody I believe in you don't do life alone but there are moments when you can't contact a soul there are moments when you don't have the support system around you to be able to call there are moments when the people around you are just as jacked up as you are and you don't have them to call on David didn't have anybody to text and FaceTime David knew these Jokers about to kill me and if I don't get it together take a neighbor real quick you got to get it together now you gotta say it real fast you got to get it together you got to get it together why because if you don't change where your mind is if you don't transform where you are you are going to sink deeper into the sinkhole of feeling bad about yourself and becoming a victim and now you begin to not think about what God has done but you begin to think about all the things that did not go the way you thought them should they should go and here is what you start to believe this seems familiar but the Bible says we gotta learn to encourage yourself the scripture says in Psalm 42 and 11 David said this why why are you cast down oh my Soul remember Body Soul Spirit we've been talking about that it says and why are you in turmoil within me hope in God for I shall again Praise Him my salvation and my God what's one thing to do to encourage yourself you got to change your environment and your space of the way you think your soul is your mind your will and emotion so what do you have to do you've got to change your perspective and your mindset of where you are and the Bible says you have to be able to realize and say to yourself why are you where you are this is another way in Psalm 43 and 5 he said this why I ask myself are you so depressed of us accept our depression and say this is who I am this is where I'll be but he said why are you so depressed why are you so upset where inside hope in God because I will again give him what maybe the solution is right there I'll give him what um my saving presence in my God I'll give him what because your mind automatically begins to go and think about the things that are wrong it begins to think about the things that aren't going the way you would like for them to go but if you just decided to start to do what give him what if you decided to start giving God things I'm just crazy enough to believe that in the middle of it you would begin to remember all that God has done and all that God has said we forget too often what the Lord has already promised we forget too often what he already spoke of our life we forget too often but God said but what if I just started giving him thanks father I thank you today because you're so good there is none like you in all the earth I would not be here in this space and in this moment if it wasn't for you God you are my keeper God you are my Waymaker God you are my healer God you are my director God if it had not been for you that was on my side I don't know where I would be if you just begin to think you would encourage yourself stop putting the weight of encouragement on the rest of the world and learn God's word and say I am the head and not the tail I am above and not beneath I'm blessing my going out and my coming in anything that God says is already yes and amen he can do more than I could imagine a thing now unto him that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that I could even ask a thing you gotta Encourage Yourself [Applause] stop looking for everybody else to give you a what's up and a good day together and how you doing you need to talk to your depression and say depression why are you are you so depressed get yourself together put your hope in God God I begin to thank you I thank you because you're worthy I thank you because you're good I thank you because there's nothing like you in all the earth I would be dead in my sinner if it had not been for the grace of God anybody got a thankful Praise In This Place somebody else right now you need to encourage yourself just tell your neighbor real quick Encourage Yourself I'm another praise right there just to take you from where father thank you nope you've been too good nope I wouldn't have made it to Sunday had it not been you nope I'm going into that job on Monday and I'm Gonna Keep where I'm at and I'm not gonna lose my sanctification I thank you for the blessings already on the way I thank you for the healing in my family I thank you for the change in my marriage I thank you for blessings beyond what I can imagine or think you are good you are faithful you are righteous You Are Holy there is none like you in all the Earth you spared my life you spent my daughter's life you spare my son's life you are faithful Faithful is our God everything about you is good and excellent you are worthy of all the praise you can't help but get your spirit together and say so get it together he's been too good stop waiting for everybody else's responsibility and start speaking to yourself I am who God says I am you know what I do look good today you know what I do feel good today you know what I am healed you know what I am the right person so stop waiting for the rest of the world to get you to where you're supposed to be how to declare it over yourself [Applause] thank them because I recognize without him I am nothing I recognize it I I see it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's been too good for me to lay who he is on what I'm going through today it's just too good and I don't want to be that flighty I don't want that kind of flighty Christianity I want that kind of Christianity I want that kind of relationship with Jesus that where I was going on the hospital table going in to get a procedure done probably for the fifth or sixth time that I could go in and joke with the doctors and say come on let's pray together come on let's be in this moment together why because I recognize or I'm coming out of this see when you know you're coming out of it already and you know it's only but for a moment that you're resting in this long pace you'll be getting to thank God on the other side of what's happening because you recognize it's already working out for my good so I can Praise Him Anyway I don't need to feel it stop trying to feel your deliverance it's already been declared so all you need to do is speak it I'm already delivered I'm already set free it's already changing it's already happening [Applause] so when I'm on the operating table I say everybody let's get together and pray and they start to give me that medicine because they don't want me to pray I got out Jesus right before I went to sleep [Applause] if I don't get nothing out imma say it [Applause] cause you got to know you're coming out on the other side you gotta know that tell your name real quick you're coming out on the other side tell your second choice you're coming out on the other side declare it third choice you're coming out on the other side you speak this thing you're coming out Carriage yourself stop feeding yourself foolishness and depressive statements and trying to get through depression with quotes you need the word my daily inspiration nobody care about your inspiration you need a word [Applause] amen all right Point number two I know how I know how I do I'm gonna get some stuff on this I know I am a point number two is that you've been called show yourself for Direction the Bible says that he went to abayathar and said give me the IFA let's get bring the E thought over the ephod was a part of what they needed in order to seek God because they needed a priest to be in the midst of because the Bible lets us know it was a little different in the Old Testament so they needed somebody in the middle of but thank God for Jesus if you understood that writing I'm not I'm gonna hold it but what happens is that oftentimes we get so busy and so high in our life that we don't know what God is saying for us and we get so high and so so so so so focused in life that when we start declining and we get high in life what God Said looks so far away [Applause] so when you can't see what God says you start making up a word and that's when the enemy has space to influence your thoughts because you're not close enough to the word to declare what God has already spoken so you try things to be able to solidify but oftentimes you realize what did God what did God say no and then the enemy says well remember last time when you went through this and how much it messed you up and remember what you did last time and you start relying on what you remember versus what God Said and when you look you know he said something the problem is is you can't recount it the Bible lets us know that he told David you will pursue and you shall recover but when I'm so high above where I need to be and I'm so distracted and focused in making sure I'm got it together and all my stuff is together and all my things are where they need I start to lose focus of what God has spoken some of us and it's high and as far as we've come the Bible says you need to humble yourself you need to position yourself [Applause] under the mighty hand of God and it doesn't mean that you stop being successful it just means you come off your ladder of Who You Think You Are and you surrender yourself to God and say you know what Lord I'm going to keep going upwards only if I have you with me so when you come instead of leaving God where he gave the promise you begin to take the promise with you and then as you move up you begin to remind people here's what God spoke and so when it gets fishy up here and it looks different and people start to sway you into another area you can begin to look you look what you are you say yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me he's with me John 101 says in the beginning what's the word the word was with God and the Word was God he is what with me I'm in the Valley of the shadow of death but you are with me your rod and your staff they what comfort me I take him Wherever I Go so I remember his promise over my life and when I posture myself forgot to speak and got to move I don't get so offended by what everyone else says or what everyone else thinks because I'm so grounded in what he is speaking that I've always got his word to be able to give me Clarity you know you ain't going far well his Bible says I shall recover all so regardless of what you say when I go back to what he says it is already yes and amen somebody give God a praise for yes and amen scripture says in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 16. it says let us go with complete Trust to the throne of God [Applause] we will receive his loving kindness and his loving favor to help us somebody say whenever whenever we need it whenever come boldly come knowing come come being sure and what God is speaking is already yes and amen in all my success and all that I strive for for myself becomes a back seat the purpose and plan of God and our last point recall Point number three wait on God wait on God the way you are right now you may feel like you're ready but I'm here today to let you know if God has not released it or opened it it's not time the Bible says that David heard God speak what they was through a biophar or he heard the audible voice of God we don't know scripture doesn't give us detail but what is communicated is David ax shall I pursue after this ban and shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for you shall surely overtake and you shall surely rescue that's the word for today somebody oh my goodness you am waiting on a word all week you were crying and you were praying and I'm here to let you know that the Lord has called you today and to say you shall what you shall recover somebody say all pursue that's the word for today pursue pursue who God's called you to be pursue everything that God says you uh pursue I don't care what's in front of me Pursuit I don't care what needs to be moved pursue I don't care what relationship I need to block right now I shall what pursue I pursue because I understand as I pursue he will make it available he said pursue for you shall surely not get enough but you shall surely overtake the battle is all ready one stop living as if it's not already one the battle is all oh my gosh if you could understand it you'll just be like I need to know when where and how because the battle is what one it is already done this thing is already in motion you shout surely somebody say surely [Music] surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it doesn't matter what it looks like but surely it shall come to pass surely he shall do it surely it's working out on my behalf surely he shall accomplish it surely I shall know surely he shall heal soil it he shall deliver surely he shall mend it together surely he shall break the Yoke surely he shall give me everything I need according to the plan that he had surely surely I'm encouraging myself right now I'm sorry I got too excited because the god of Heaven has called me to some things that I don't see how I'm going to do it but I have to walk in it shortly I gotta encourage myself he said surely that means it's all ready done pass I don't I don't have the people I don't have the finances I don't have the support [Music] some of you God has removed your support because he needs you to learn to depend on him you're like you got enough money you could fund it it's not my job to do God's job God says this season I need you to learn to trust in me if the finances are going to come it's going to become become I give this word to you today right now it's not happening until you position yourself for God to speak and for God to move [Music] when you come out on the other side you'll get very familiar with the way God moves and when trouble hits you'll start to smile again and say this seems familiar and because you beat it last time you'll know what to do this time and so you start immediately when you feel it sinking which you'll start to do imma give them thanks God right now I thank you God right now I honor you I've seen this before and the enemy's trying to get me all Focus so I know exactly what to do listen you got some people talking in your ear telling you you're the only one that can make it happen you're the only one that can get there you're the only one that can make those things come to pass you have enough money you don't have enough strength you don't have enough intelligence to get to where God wants you to be you must rely on him so instead of complaining how about you just give thanks
