[Music] thank you celebrate the King of Kings and the Lord of lords can you help me give God who is worthy of all priests and all honor and all glory can you help me the Bible says right now the Bible says won't you switch that Garment of heaviness for a spirit of Praise right now anybody got a raise Lord I thank you you kept me you watched over me you kept my mind you killed my body you healed my heart you are God [Music] and there's nobody like you [Applause] I was sitting in my seat and as I was coming up I felt the Lord drop in my heart as is it Marcus I'm telling you there is a worship in this place and the worship in this place has the ability but the Bible says when the spirit of the Lord is there is somebody say Liberty and what God Has Come Today is not to free the pressure of process come to free the pressure and the weight that the process is on you and I want to say this to you today wherever you are in this moment right now is that in heaven the Bible says that the angels are rejoicing the Bible lets us know that they're going to and fro from from the Throne of God because sometimes we only think worship and praise is what we're doing in here but right now the Bible lets us know in the holies of holies the angels are moving back and forth and this is what they're saying they're saying holy holy holy it's the Lord God Almighty Worthy is a lamb to be worshiped to be praised to be glorified and why can they praise him because they have freedom tell your neighbor it's time to get free for me and I believe that if you can just release the Garment of heaviness for Spirit of praise and the Bible says where two or three are gathered together touch screen look at your neighbor and smile and say we got this because there's something about the touching and the agreeing that even if I don't have it all myself what you and I have connected in touching and agreeing will bring a liberty and the freedom in his presence I just think right now that this area in this moment in the presence of God can change your very Life In This Moment not change just your circumstance but change your life in the way that's on your life right now and I believe today if you could just release tell tell somebody beside you just give God just a couple of seconds of race if you could just come together if you could just connect with somebody if you could just look them in the eye and say I don't know what it is you might be going through so Tiana says there he will be in the midst in the Greek phrase in this place anybody saying I'm coming real quick real quick real quick real quick real quick I worshiping we're going to talk about the presence of God real quick and so what I want you to do just close your eyes don't even look at me don't worry about what I'm doing I'm just jumping around excited about what God's about to do in your life I'm excited for what he's about to change and I just want you I should close your eyes just take a moment and just lift your hand nobody's looking at you nobody's wearing if it's one hand if it's a half a hand if it's a low hand whatever it is just give that hand real quick to God and say Lord I need you to do something right now take the weight off I need you to take the weight off and help me to have a Garment of Praise right now I need a spirit of praise for the Garment of heaviness I need a spirit of praise for the Garment of heaviness right now Lord I need you to do it right now and can you just worship with us just give us about couple more minutes and we're just gonna worship and let the weights drop off if you feel an opportunity you can come to the Altar and you can give it over to God and you can release in this moment and say father whatever the burden is whatever the weight is I need you to to relieve it right now let's just keep the hand up keep the hand up let's begin to worship God together can we give God a priest in this place for freedom in the name of Jesus [Applause] clearing it with it you feel it whether you know it God I thank you I'm free from perfectionism yeah come on God I'm I'm free today I'm free from the weight of being perfect with everybody around me God I'm just gonna transform me as I'm being mean mistakes and oh God I thank you today for your freedom because your freedom brings Liberty in Jesus name somebody declared by saying amen amen God bless you listen look to your neighbor real quick and tell your neighbor I'm so glad you sat by me today come on in Jesus name it's good to have you here you can have your seats in the House welcome to the mix y'all it's so good to have y'all here so good to be a part of what God is doing and I'm so grateful that you are in this moment with us I really believe we're the spirit of the Lord is there is truly Liberty and freedom and I'm believing that for your life today my name is Marcus England I'm the lead Pastor here at the mix and I am grateful to be able to serve in an amazing Church in an amazing place where the presence of God can flow freely I believe if there is a church and it does not have the presence of God then all it is is a building or an institution where people are coming together to make a noise but I believe where the presence of God is there is Joy there is Liberty there is freedom there is transformation in the name of Jesus Christ we're in week three of our series heart to heart and I'm excited about all that God is doing as we're having this conversation about what God is saying to us and we're going to turn to Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6. if you get out your Bibles get out your notepads this is one of the ways I believe that we make the greatest impact is that we are involved in our growth we are involved in what God is doing and what God is speaking here's what I believe is that you can come in and be a part of a church but your faith can be dead but if you bring that Faith to life the Bible says through Works through a participating space of saying Lord I'm going to allow your word to change me from inside to outwardly I believe that you will see the manifestation of God working the Bible says let us not just be hearers of the word but let us also be towards Matthew chapter 6 verse 25. now Jesus is speaking he says this he says therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life anybody know right now you know somebody else not you but you know some people that are dealing with some anxieties of life because they don't know what's next they they don't know what is the next move to make the the things that they had planned have changed and life has gotten a little bit anxious but the Bible Jesus lets us know he says do not be anxious about your life says what you will eat and some of you have already made brunch plans I said pastor move this thing along [Music] this is what you eat or what you would drink it says nor about your body what you will put on is life is not life more than food and the body more than clothing it says look at the birds of the air they neither Soul nor reap nor gather into Barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them the question that he asks if you really know who you are it says are you not a more value than they and which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his or her span of Life question is by being worried right now how are you adding another hour or moment to your life what you're thinking about right now how can you add another hour or moment to your life he said stop being anxious and why are you anxious about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet I tell you Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these but if God so close the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you oh you of little faith therefore do not be anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear I want to say right there real quick real quick it says therefore do not be anxious saying I want to say something to you right now what you say out of your mouth is impacting your spirit the very words that you're declaring out of your mouth Jesus said it's not just by what's happening inwardly but it's by what's happening with what you say out of your mind don't be anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear he says for the Gentiles meaning the pagans those who worship other gods seek after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them all he said but seek first somebody say first you got to write that down in your notes you got to put that thing on paper seek first the kingdom of God not your girlfriend not your homies it says seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you now therefore do not be anxious he said that word a lot you think it was for this series and this time where anxiety is one of the most crippling parts of our life where we live in a place of anxiety and depression always worrying about weary it says therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow we'll be anxious for yourself can I get an amen right there listen I'm telling you tomorrow is already worrying about tomorrow you you don't even have to worry about tomorrow for itself it's already wearing for you you just got to worry about yourself but it says sufficient for the day is its own trouble I want to come from the topic today worry Free Living worry Free Living can you pray with me in this moment as I pray a long prayer father [Music] help us to live where are we free in Jesus name amen I I I said oftentimes we are constantly praying not a prayer of faith but a prayer of weary because we don't understand what's next because we don't understand how God is going to move in the promises that he said he would move in to do what he said it would do we we find ourselves wearing wearing about our finances worrying about our family wearing about our children worrying about the state of the economy wearing we're wearing we're wearing and awary anybody know you are overloading yourself with more information than you can handle you're walking around talking statistics and stats about life that you don't even care about just because you're worried about life anybody seen the stock market is going up today what does the interest rate look like what's happening today what do you think has happened with the housing market what do you think is happening today and all we do is worry control over in our life can I tell you it would be better for you to worry about the areas of your life that you have control over than to worry about the things in your life that you have no control over some of you are worrying about your job whether you will be fired or not I want to let you know you have no control over it unless you are consistently late foreign I want to let you know today you cannot control the manipulating people that are around you you cannot control the actions of others can we be honest today you really can't even control you and the point of it all is that we spend so much time worrying and perfecting and and living an anxiety about what's next I don't know if the Social Security will be available for me at 60 where we're 20 worrying about what's happening 45 years from now we're we're nervous we don't know if to put our money in the bank or under the mattress we just don't know what to do and we're living a life that's so consumed and wary that oftentimes we don't know that we speak out of weary we talk out of weary we even pray out of weary the Bible says don't you know that the Lord knows everything that you have need of now there's a difference if we want to clarify the difference between need and one come on y'all y'all need to talk to me right there because some of us we have needs other of us we don't know the difference between the need and the want and so we have misplaced the word need in the space of what we want I need to get these pair of jeans because they fit so well no no no you want those pair of jeans you don't need what you think it is and what are me driven lives have given over is to a want Driven Life which keeps us oftentimes from the goals and the purpose of what God has called for us to achieve in our life we're cause so consumed on what we want Lord I need you to send me a man you don't need a man you want a man cause you was lonely last night when that wind was blowing on your windows Lord I need a woman you don't need a woman you just got a little lonely watching the wrong movie at the wrong time and you started dialing past nine o'clock and everybody knows when the phone goes off past nine that is something else that somebody is asking from you Y'all Gonna Act Like y'all don't know you're gonna act like you if that Pastor I'm Steve he changed me he delivered me I don't do that no more and then some of us are in the place in life where we're where we're with somebody and you're just asking God can they go on vacation can their job call them will somebody Lord I just need five minutes I just need a moment if the kids could just leave me if I could just have a moment and oftentimes I think we spend our lives worrying about everyone else and everything else but we don't know how to live for the day that we're in how many of us are consumed with what's going to happen at brunch or what's going to happen tonight or what's going to happen ahead of time anybody ever been somewhere before and you ask about the traffic a week in advance yeah hey how's the traffic down there down where down where you are I'm coming down there in a month and I just want to make sure that I come at the right time we are so fearful of being inconvenienced we are so fearful of what it would be like to to be in a place a process of suffering that we're always looking for the easiest route to get to where we need to be I know if you know like I know I got ways y'all and Waze lets me know when there's an accident there's a problem I take ways from my house to my job and it's only about three minutes away because I'm always trying to avoid the inconvenience a process because each day God has something prepared and a process for me to walk through but because I'm trying to avoid and Skip process and trying to live as comfortably as I would like to I do not notice that while I'm avoiding the things that are inconvenience I'm also avoiding my growth I want to tell you today that you would know how to live better in life when moments happen if you actually lived out the moments and if you stopped escaping the process of what the moment brings some of you are scared to move in a relationship and and to change directions because you're scared about what the person will think you're scared about how they feel about you you're scared about what could take place but here's the thing the process of walking through the hurt and the pain helps to build you because some of the most successful people in life are some of the people have gone through the most pain I want to tell you today your pain won't get wasted if you allow God to use it in the proper way now here's what I believe today is that you can have worry-free living while the enemy is Raising havoc on your life [Applause] you haven't seen somebody smiling you know their situation and they're looking at you they said no I am okay you're like it's impossible I know the state of your marriage it's jacked up it's broken and you're still smiling and you say how can you even be that way because there's something on the inside that I understand that if I worry about somebody else who I cannot change I cannot make do what I want to do I will paralyze myself from walking in the freedom so there's no need for both of us to be paralyzed because broken can't help broken all broken do is find more broken people to break yeah I'll just walk in Freedom and I'll let your freedom catch up with my freedom and as we walk in Freedom together I'll wait on you because I remember when I was broken and I remember when I didn't have it all together and I remember when I needed someone to be there with me so just stick with me a little while I understand in the moment that you're dealing with it it seems like I'm all but you got to tell your neighbor real quick just stick with me some of you looked at a stranger and was like uh I'm not sure if I should say that just say it the idea behind it is is you have to learn that if you can become like a tree planted by the rivers of water you could bring forth fruit in the season that God has for you but if you're not willing to walk through anything you don't know how to live worry free when all hell is breaking loose it is the enemy's design that you would be disconnected from the father so that every time worry hits your life you will bust out cry and make a scene of yourself because you don't know how to handle trials and tribulations I remember when my wife and I we got married when when when everybody knows when you you're by yourself I remember I had my apartment y'all I had my apartment and and they would come over and you know when other people come into your space they they do stuff to it now if it don't bother you how your stuff is and it's not a conversation for you but if you got a hinge a tinge of a little bit of an OCD you you're trying to get your life right put the shoes on the shoe mat where the shoe mat says Schumacher that's easy I don't understand why you can't do it when you walk into my house take your shoes off and put the booties on you anybody ever been there before if you can just go with me life could be so much better anybody know you married that person because you love them with all your heart and all your soul you cried at the wedding it's not came on a little and you just was oh my God I love you I can't believe so amazing and you got home and you noticed they don't put stuff back where it's supposed to be and now you got a little bit of problem because that person that you signed and crying for now they're a little bit irritable to you and you're just like listen I I love you because you always want to start off with love because God is love [Applause] you say I love you but I need for you to understand the preference of my life is that you would work in these boundaries to keep my sanity and my anxiousness from wearing out I had an apartment it was all together the way I left it is the way I came back to it but when people enter into your life can I tell you that life with other people gets messy it gets messy because you can't control the set of circumstances and they would come and they would be a part I would just saying my god do I really want to get into a family because if they can't put their shoes on the shoe mat God only knows what we're walking into just to say to myself because together starts to build you and you don't notice when now you're doing life together things get a little bit crammy a little bit crammy in the way of I didn't know that you you you see the toothpaste on on the sink counter but it doesn't affect you like it affects me I didn't know that that when your toothbrush hung out and you look like you bathed in the sink and water has engulfed some of y'all in here just cringing down Jesus save my soul you didn't notice that there was something a little bit different from you I remember I would get up in the morning and I go to bed but my children they're up at night y'all know about night kids they like staying up hey all night you don't know what they're doing you hear them in there they sound like little mice you know just moving it y'all and I'm one of them dads they just used to say yellow hey you're about to go to bed in there you see you hear the scuffle and stop I'm like all right and then I wake up in the middle of the night and I hear that scuffling again somebody that went downstairs didn't open up the refrigerator lights are on and I come downstairs and I notice that things are changed and they're different and I noticed that when God is doing things in your life things change but oftentimes we ask God for change without wanting change see we like change as long as it doesn't change just don't change it in me oh mine things altering just leave it the way that it is and God says I can't change your life without changing you but the problem with changes change brings anxiety and if you don't learn to cope with anxiety Then you don't understand that God is working things out in you so that not that you can get people where you are but so that you can have the patience to walk in the grace and truth of where others are see when you can't walk in someone else's shoes you don't have the ability to understand what they're going through and many times we're anxious at life how passive can you preach about what's happening in the world and be so calm because I probably have been somewhere where you are I've had some moments in life and I understand that worrying does not add a single minute our day month or year to your life so the question today is why are you so anxious about the things that are not even here yet to control and if you can learn to stop worrying you could probably live a worry-free life Jesus is given an instance here and he says why are you worried about what you will eat what you will drink what clothes you are wearing well why does Jesus specifically bring that out because many of us before we had any money we were worried about what what are we going to eat we'll be gonna drink what we gonna wear what we gonna do today some of you I'm not here to point fingers but you didn't make it to the countdown at 10 30. because you were worried about what you were gonna wear and it wasn't because you didn't have anything it was because you had what yep you don't want to say it you don't want to be free you didn't want to say it right there I heard you I heard everybody too much and you didn't say I said no you moved from a place of having the need to the place of you have so much of what you want you don't even know what you want anymore can I be honest some of us are are in life with people and they ask you what do you want for your birthday [Music] what do you say I don't even know remember when you were a kid and you weren't in control of your life and you had no money I mean you just had no control y'all remember when Christmas came what did you have a list what would you like where you want me to start I got every GI Joe on this list that you can possibly think of the reason was is because we understood we had nothing so we wanted to ask for everything but how many of us are getting in prayer today and we don't even have a prayer life to have because God has supplied all of our needs according to his riches and Glory so when we get in prayer we're almost at a place where we're like Lord will you um ah bless my children I don't I don't know because now we're doing so well that in what you have you found your Allegiance for the Bible says where your treasure is there your heart will be also for whatever it is that you wait and put your emphasis on it's where you will end up in your life today I believe that we can have worry Free Living if we stop running after prosperity for ourselves and start running after prosperity for our community um is your promotion about you or is your promotion about the people you're going to impact once you get it I'm interested because this will change your whole dynamic to worry free living and there are a couple of thoughts and ideas that I believe that Jesus is speaking in Matthew chapter six that can help you the first idea that I thought about is that in in order to really have a worry-free life we've got to refocus our priorities somebody say refocus anybody have any evidence can just be so off that you are focused on the things that don't even matter my question today is where are you spending your time because where you spend your time is where you're going to find your return on investment your return on investment is going to be everything to which you give your life to whatever you spend your life doing is the very thing that you'll end up praising and worshiping over the God who gave you everything you already have my question today is what is your priorities the first thing you ought to do is refocus your priorities well Pastor why should I refocus my priorities because the Bible says the first thing that you should be seeking after is who God seek ye first what the kingdom of God what does that mean that means that when I switch citizenship from being in the kingdom of darkness to being in the Kingdom of Light what I needed to learn was how to live in a new kingdom if I don't know how to live in the New Kingdom then guess what I'll take Old Kingdom ways and bring them into a new kingdom mindset My Old Kingdom ways was I do it when I want I do it how I want I do it where I want and I do it for the reasons that I want to do it for the king of mindset says my priorities are given to me by God according to what he speaks and lays on my part if God says go I go if he says say this I say this if he says move I move but the problem is is my priorities are no longer his priorities my priorities are the things that I care about the most and God says have your priorities become your symbols of worship can I ask you today are you worshiping School more than you're worshiping the one who's taking you through it I gotta have that degree because once I get that degree everything's gonna change once I get that one degree I'm just telling you my life is going to be brand new and you can ask somebody with a degree that is into their job and fully at the top and they'll look at you with the burden and weight of heaviness and tell you I can let you know when you get up here it gets weighty and it gets heavy so make sure you have a god plan for what happens when you get there because if not it will Define Who You Are and everything that you're going after when it stops giving you the pulse of fulfillment you feel empty in life you can work but feel empty you can go to school and feel empty you can drive the coops relax and the bins to all my friends I just want to tell you keep your head up this is not just for the East Coast it's also for the West Coast and it's worldwide let's just add that it because I want to tell you your focus matters today the question you need to write down is what am I focused on what are we as a family focused on are we split so much and where we're going that we have no Focus so where there is no Focus there is no Direction where there is no direction we have no goal to go out there where there is no goal we have no purpose so we do everything that fulfills us where we are some of you are going to destinations to find fulfillment but your destination doesn't bring fulfillment it is the purpose that God has set over your life [Applause] you got to refocus your priorities I want you to look at the scripture in Luke chapter 12 verse 33-34 it says this be generous somebody said be generous give to the poor get yourselves a bank that can't go bankrupt I would suggest you don't do Wells Fargo I would suggest you may not go to Bank of America I would suggest that the Bible says don't go to something that it can be easily taken away it says but a bank in heaven far from bank robbers safe from embezzlers a bank you can Bank on not you can bank with a bank you can Bank on it says it's obvious isn't it the place where your treasure is is the place you will most want to be and end up being the question is where you are is a product of where your heart was wherever you ended up you got you got to write this down I am where my heart led me to be I am where my heart led me to be that's the product of how I got here I am where my heart led me to be because whatever was most important is the very thing that I'm ending up in here's what I want to let you know if your heart is for the things of God you are in a thriving relationship with Jesus Christ if it's not then whatever's thriving in your life right now is what became first priority for you the question is has God taken priority or are you at the place right now in your life something else has your attention and my question is if it has your attention then what place is God in your life refocus your priorities second thing I want you to do is prioritize your Pursuit prioritize your receipt pursue what does that look like I've got to tell myself this is what I'm going after and whenever I go after I'm going to give myself fully too what are you going after what are you going after what are you going after what are you going after how do you look after what are you going after whatever it is that you're going after that is going to be where you land so in your life right now what are you going after ladies I can tell you if you're going after a man you will find one what kind I don't know but you will find one tell us I want to let you know if you're in Pursuit for a lady you will find one this is the one that's good for you I don't know can't help you with that one but you will find whatever you seek for here is the thing whatever it is that you have come upon it's not by accident you were LED there by the desire that's within so the question today is Hallelujah yes Scott all right I just had a worship moment don't even worry about that God is moving in this place listen whatever is your Pursuit will be the thing you focus on here's the thing whatever is your addiction is what you gave your time to your addiction did not pop up your addiction was nurtured so whatever you nurture grows somebody say grow whatever I nurture gross can I help you real quick if you nurture your marriage it will if you nurture your children they will scripture lets you know if you nurture your selfish behaviors it will grow the question is what are you putting into the ground and what are you watering because whatever it is that you're giving seed to and whatever it is that you're watering is doing what growing if you got anger problems I need you to stop listening to mob deep and Wu-Tang because you're never gonna get delivered on 95 listening that way it's not gonna happen why because it has everything to do with what you're putting on the inside of you what you're pursuing after you have to prioritize your Pursuit if your children are falling away what do you have to put in front the children my question today is if your relationship with God is slipping have you prioritized it or are you expecting it to grow on its own can I tell you this if you if you don't know how to forgive and you hold on to anger what's going to grow from it anger right so the question is what are you watering some of you can I can I can I speak Deliverance in this house I'm just going to speak it real quick some of you that are dealing with perfectionism is because you keep watering the seed of comparison and everyone you want to be like is everyone that's on your storyline and everybody that's on your storyline keeps popping up and reminding you where you are you know I love that person and they keep popping up man I don't got 10 million dollars a day you like I hate myself I hate myself and you start throwing away your process not understanding that God is getting you to the finish line of where you need to be if you would just stay there but because you keep comparing yourself and you look at everyone else's life instead of looking at your own and being able to say I'm God's man I'm God's woman God has set me a hood God has put me as a Victor God has made me more than a conqueror instead of being able to feed yourself the things that God says I am not to I am the head and not to tell I'm above and not beneath I'm blessed anybody I know you blessed I'm blessed am I going out and am I coming in instead of repeating that I'm looking at everyone else's story and I'm comparing my life and the problem is is you didn't go what they went through to get to where they are but you start pursuing other people's dreams and goals because you don't have one for yourself you look at someone else's marriage and you see that little hashtag relationship goals anybody ever taken a picture before when you were unhappy with somebody you ain't never done that before smile for the picture you've never done that before you never tried to get the family photo Christmas is coming all the kids acting tripping smile I don't want to that's why I'ma take you to Pastor please don't bring your children to me but anybody know that you can create a fake moment in a miserable life [Applause] because you're looking at everybody else and you're comparing it with everybody and they got one I should get one and they got and you'll be like no because you don't have a goal you're gonna get what they get because you're not trying to get to where you need to be well what they got I'm a what they got with the Browns guy look what they got over there and you start looking to compare yourself because you don't have a stable mindset of where you're going here is why I'm telling you that you could thrive in life if you would cut off things that are bringing you at a place of comparison that you could go so much further not watching someone else and trying to repeat what they do you call it your purpose I call you just repeating what you see happening now there is no what identity there is nothing somebody say unique just tell your neighbor real quick you're unique see we don't even believe that believe that said it we we you heard you unique and believe see if y'all married you're unique oh you was angry woman you unique all right but can I tell you the Bible says we are a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do great words can I tell you you are unique there is nobody else like you just tell the neighbor on the other side says the other one had a bad attitude you're unique that's it you are unique why do you keep trying to be like everyone else's goals how are you going to have relationship goals like everybody else when you don't know what their goals are you know what you saw in a moment you you think back there scrapping you talking about yeah God give us that no no don't give me that once that thing over but because they know how to make a story you got sucked in because someone know how to create a story you found it to be true and I'm here today to let you know you can let go of perfectionism because I promise you whoever you're looking up to is imperfect relationship goals or not career or not let that stuff go and say guess what I'ma decide to be me today because if I can decide to be me today and work on me somebody say now then tomorrow has enough problems of its own and I'll deal with tomorrow but here's the thing I can't conquer tomorrow without conquering today because my actions of today impact my tomorrow and I'm so consumed with what's what's ahead that I don't know how to fix myself with what's happening right now you got to deal with the you right now you got to deal with the relationship right now you got to deal with the issues right now I have so so many people this even in times when they've gotten married they say once we get married it's gonna get better the Devil is a Lie you ain't going to know altar with no new person they don't because somebody said I do not in fact I'm more irritated or how much I paid I can only wear this suit one time that's how I was I was mad I'm aware this shoot this Sunday why are you in the honeymoon with a suit on because I paid a lot of money and I'm not just wearing this suit one time [Applause] the idea behind it is we're often trying to trying to emulate something that was never for us how about you emulate you that's why you so stressed out because you're carrying someone else's purpose [Applause] Hebrews 11 and 6 says this and without faith it is impossible somebody say impossible and without faith it is impossible to please him God for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he what exists and that he rewards those who seek him so let me help you real quick whatever you're facing today is what it is today it doesn't mean it will be what it is tomorrow the situation where you are you've got to face it somebody say now you can't ignore it you got to deal with it if it's a heart issue somebody say face it now I gotta face it now because if I don't face it now it'll linger till tomorrow and then tomorrow it will go into a deeper darker place and when it's in a deeper darker place and I don't deal with it then it becomes anxiety and then anxiety moves to depression and then now I'm a repeat offender of the Legacy that was behind me because oftentimes we find ourselves coming out of spaces where our parents dealt with it where our uncles and aunts dealt with it and they never said anything about it but you always talk about Uncle rudo always got a bad attitude he got bad attitude just like you got a bad attitude so you need to fix it before it gets passed down to the next set and the next group of people because they'll be worried just like you'll wear it and living out of a broken mindset and a broken life gets your act together for the Next Generation so that they have something to work on [Music] we jacked up telling people I'm fine no you're not go get some help go clean it up go work on it but stop ignoring it tell your neighbor stop ignoring it keep ignoring it it's there we see it and guess what we got our own stuff so I ain't got time to focus on yours I'll pray with you I'll be in agreement that God would change it for you but I can't give you help and something where I'm working on me just tell somebody beside you I'm working on me so don't be asking too much of me now again I can help you a little bit but I'm still crazy over here working on me you know what I'm saying I was up late last night we all at the house I'm cleaning up like people I'm cleaning what's wrong with you I I don't like it it's just everywhere I just got to get it together just worrying and sometimes you just I'm gonna free somebody right now sometimes whatever it is you are obsessed over you just need to let it go and walk away you know what I'll get it in the morning [Music] and I won't let the world determine and let people know just because they put their house on it and their house looks amazing and clean yes because they have three people that are working in there to keep it clean and they did it for the story foreign they did it for somebody to say the story yeah the question is are you living life for the story are you living it to see change truly happen and point number three stop worrying and live [Applause] there's a difference between existing and living [Music] and pull this car real quick are you frowning more in your life than you're smiling [Music] have you just found yourself overly concerned and frowning about everything how you doing today fine it doesn't really look like it do you have anything to rejoice and smile about I'm gonna get you some friends real quick start smiling people are willing to come up to you when you smile Kirk Franklin wrote that song Smile even though it hurts smile because there's something about breaking the normalizing of whatever it is that I do I always just express it no you know what God's called me to be an overcomer so it means I'm not lying about how I feel but I'm not living out what it is that I do feel I'm saying there's something greater I want to let you know today no matter where you are you can still give God a praise because where you are is not where you'll stay so I can begin to thank God and say you know I'm hopeful that this afternoon is going to be better I'm hopeful that what God is going to do tomorrow it may be better than what happened today I'm hopeful that I'll see greater tomorrow than I'm seeing happen today anybody hopeful for what God has in store for you I'm hopeful it's going to get better foreign [Applause] tell somebody else on the other side it's gonna get better tell your third choice I'm sorry you're my third choice but it's gonna get better you got the preset to somebody I came to church because I believe it's gonna get better I might not know how I might not know when I might not know where but I'm declaring today it's gonna get better it won't always say like this I won't say an anxiety I won't say in depression why it's gonna get better I'm declaring it over myself self it's cold get better I don't care what it looked like last week anybody declaring right now this week it's gonna get somebody say better better's in store for me better's on the way better's in my life I'm declaring it today better how do you know I just believe by faith I just have the mindset to be crazy enough to believe that God doesn't want me to say where I am so better's on the way I'm walking the path a better I'm living the life of better my bank account better my life better my marriage better my children better somebody declare better [Music] it's better it's not what it can be but it's not what it used to be it's getting somebody to say better you got to speak that all week when the enemy is whispering in your ear are you sure that's what God said you got to come back and tell them this ain't gonna get better you don't even know what I got and saw an enemy you're just scared because of what God is doing in my life I need you to know this thing is getting better [Music] I don't care where I'm at it's getting better yeah [Music] solely up from here it's only up from here it's only up from here I don't know why I feel like the spirit got me into rapping mode [Applause] but I was going to tell you nothing can stop me I'm all the way up tell somebody beside you I'm all the way up okay nothing inside me I don't care how bad it gets okay nothing's taught me I'm all the way up don't go play that after church I hit a parking lot everybody like yeah I said no but he can't stop me why because greater is he that is within me than he that is in the world that's something to hold on to y'all and so today we're declaring that over Allah how are we going to live worry free we're going to make the decision to refocus our priorities to prioritize our pursuit to pursue after Jesus and to stop worrying and live I will not exist I will live [Music] and the Bible says as I live I will declare The Works of the Lord
