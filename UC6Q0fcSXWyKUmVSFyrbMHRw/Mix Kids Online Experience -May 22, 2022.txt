[Music] [Music] good morning guys i am mishi and this is mix kids i am so happy to be here with you this week last week we talked about the prophet micah and having godly behaviors before we get started with today's lesson let me tell you who we are we are a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world we want to give you guys fun and exciting ways to know god and tell so that you can tell others about god in today's lesson we are going to learn about a man by the name of gideon during this time in history god's people were not honoring him some even worship other gods because of this god allowed an enemy called the midianites to come and take everything from his people the midianites took the israelites land animals and food god's people knew that they were ruined and cried out to the lord for help the lord heard their cries and had compassion on them god decided to save his people through an unlikely warrior named gideon as we look at gideon's story we will see how gideon learns that with god nothing is impossible take a look god's story gideon so part of god's story is about a man named gideon and it begins like this israel god's special family had turned against the one real god and worshiped idols they had forgotten how god had loved and cared for them and needed a reminder that he was the one in charge so god took away the israelites farms for seven long years whenever the israelites planted craps god would let another nation called the midianites sweep through and camp on israel's land ruining everything that was growing there but even though his own family had forgotten him god still loved them deeply so at the end of the seven years god appeared to a young israelite named gideon god said he was going to free the israelites with gideon's help gideon however wasn't so sure so he asked god to prove himself by performing a series of miracles gideon said if the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry then i will know that you're going to help me rescue israel as you promised that's what happened just to be sure the next night gideon asked god to do the opposite make the fleece dry and make the ground wet and god did it next he even sent a sign through an angel gideon was finally convinced that god was in his corner so he called together an army to fight against the midianites now normally having lots of people is a good thing when you're about to battle but like i said god does things a bit differently he told gideon that the israelites had too many soldiers if they won now god knew the israelites would say it was because of their own strength and brag about it so god wanted gideon to have a smaller army gideon was nervous but he did as god asked which is always a good idea by the way he told his men that if they were afraid they could return home with that 22 000 soldiers left leaving gideon with about 10 000 for you math whizzes that's two-thirds of his army just poof gone even after all that the army was still too big so god told gideon to take the soldiers down to the water to drink and then send home the soldiers who drank out of the stream like dogs again gideon did what god asked and was now left with only 300 soldiers god knew gideon was probably worried so he told him to sneak down to the enemy camp where gideon heard soldiers talking about a crazy dream where a loaf of bread rolled into the midianite camp and over their tent one soldier said that could only mean that gideon would triumph over them gideon returned to his own camp confident that he would win the battle he divided his men into three groups and gave them each a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside not usually what you bring to a fight but god had a plan gideon's army reached the edge of the midianite camp and then went into action they blew their trumpets smashed their jars and shouted a sword for the lord and for gideon and don't forget they did all of this without a single weapon in their hands terrified the midianites fled accidentally attacking each other as they went in fact they ran so far from the battlefield that other israelites were able to capture and defeat the leaders of the midianites with the enemy leaders gone and their army running away god had saved israel just like he said he would and that's the story of gideon so in case you missed it here's the quick version israel turned away from god god reminded them he was in charge god said he would save israel he would use gideon god performed miracles for gideon gideon gathered an army god made it smaller much smaller soldiers had a dream gideon's army surprised their enemies the midianites ran away god used gideon to save israel and that's a part of god's story our demonstration today is about trust trust means to believe in the truth of someone or something for example we can trust in the change of seasons in the winter we know that it's really cold outside and it may snow and this spring we know that it rains a lot and flowers begin to bloom and this summer it's really hot and we can swim in the fall the leaves begin to change and the weather is a bit nice we can trust in the change of seasons because we've experienced it and we know it to be true talking about trust makes me think about an experiment that i heard about i've never done it before and i'm sure if i'm not sure if it'll even work let's take a look [Music] what a cool experiment guys we can trust and believe in jesus and we can trust that he will always be with us just like he was with gideon in today's lesson we see that god's people brought trouble on themselves when they stopped honoring him and turned to other gods god had mercy on his people when they asked him for help the lord sent an unlikely warrior by the name of gideon to rescue the israelites from the hands of the midianites as we watch in the video we see that god used what the world would consider a nobody to deliver his people from their enemy gideon didn't rely on his own strength for victory but rather trusted god by obeying the plan god had given him when we trust god nothing is impossible our memory verse for this week says blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it luke 11 and 28 thanks so much for helping me with this week's memory verse before we go let's sing and dance to one way by hillsong kids
