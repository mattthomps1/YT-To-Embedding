from john 15 and 13. hi boys and girls i'm so glad you came today i wanted to share my eggs with you and bunny you're here today too you have some eggs too but my eggs have something special in them let's look at this egg what color is this egg this is a blue egg [Music] inside the blue egg is a donkey yes a donkey jesus rode a donkey into jerusalem so that he could celebrate the passover the people hollered at jesus and they they said hell jesus they took palm branches this is a brown one but they probably were green then they thought he was king but he came to be a king but not the kind of king they thought let's see what this egg is oh what color is this one this one is purple yes let's see what's inside oh it's a chalice or a cup yes a cup when they celebrated the passover jesus took the cup and he said take drink this and remember me how i died on the cross for you after they finished the supper the dinner they went into the garden jesus wanted to pray to his father look at the orange egg inside the orange egg are some hands that's right bunny they're praying hands jesus went to the garden to pray he asked the disciples to pray too but they went to sleep jesus prayed not my will but thine be done what did he mean he meant he didn't want to go to the cross but he would do that because he loved god and he wanted to please his father yes he said yes to god we can pray and we can say yes to god too [Music] what color is this egg yes it's yellow inside the yellow egg is a circle it represents the crown that they put on jesus head this was not a pretty crown like kings wear but it was a crown made out of stickers thorns like needles and they stuck it on jesus head they put a robe on him and they made fun of him and bowed down and they said hail king of the jews they hurt jesus and here's a dark yellow egg inside the dark yellow egg is a cross yes they crucified jesus that meant they took nails and they put them in his hands and his feet and jesus died on the cross for you and for me for our sins when jesus died his friends came and they took his body down from the cross and let's look in the pink egg they took jesus body and they placed it in a tomb after they put it in the tomb they covered his body with with a cloth and they put a stone in front of the door of the tomb that was so that nobody could come and take jesus body out because the rulers the the religious rulers were afraid that the disciples or his friends would say that he came alive like he said he would do well they put that heavy stone in front of the door and then they had to leave because it was close to the time of the curfew like we have you know we have a curfew where we're supposed to be in our houses well they had to go back because the jewish people did not stay out after it got dark out so they were home for three days and they came back with some ointment or perfumes to put on the body of jesus and as they were coming back they looked let's open our last egg what do you see bunny look boys and girls what do you see nothing there's nothing in the egg jesus body was not in the tomb the tomb was empty there was no one in there jesus was alive he is alive he is alive go tell that jesus is alive he is alive he is alive go tell that jesus is alive he's no longer in the grave he arose my soul to save he is alive he is alive go tell that jesus is alive thank you so much for sharing my eggs with me and now we're going to see a video that will tell you all about the story the story of easter jesus's sacrifice [Music] this is jesus heyo who is the son of god and the savior of the world while jesus was on earth he taught everyone about god's love and healed people from their sickness he did many miracles like calming storms and even raised people from the dead [Music] the jewish leaders and teachers did not like what jesus was doing or how he claimed to be the son of god and so they made a plan to arrest him to get rid of him once and for all judas one of jesus's disciples agreed to betray jesus come in come in and give him over to the religious leaders for some money jesus was in a garden praying and judas showed the man who jesus was jesus was arrested and taken to the rulers of the land so that they could decide what to do with him jesus was presented before the high council and they asked him if he was the messiah the savior of the jews they asked him if he was claiming to be the son of god you say that i am and the council was furious and they shouted that jesus was guilty and he deserves to die so they took jesus before the roman ruler pilate and he heard the case against jesus pilate didn't think that jesus had done anything wrong huh seemed okay to me they found him to be innocent so pilate said that he would punish jesus and then release him but the crowd kept screaming louder and louder crucify him we want him dead and because of the pressure of the crowd pilate turned jesus over to the roman soldiers to be crucified jesus was hurt and spit on his clothes were torn and taken from him and a crown made out of thorns was put on his head he was beaten so badly that he could barely stand on his own and then he was forced to carry his cross so far up a mountain that he needed help because he could not do it on his own [Music] once jesus made it to the place where he would be crucified called the skull the soldiers around him nailed him to the cross and waited for him to die while jesus was hanging on the cross many people shouted to him if you really are the son of god save yourself from the cross but jesus knew he had to die to forgive his people for their sins at noon darkness fell across the whole land three hours later jesus took his last breath and finally died [Music] at that very moment the curtain in the temple that separated the priests from god's holy place tore in two a soldier watching the whole thing said this man truly was the son of god a righteous man named joseph came and placed jesus's body in a tomb three days passed and it seemed that there was no hope [Music] but very early on sunday morning the woman who cared for jesus went to go visit his body and found that his tomb was empty and that he was no longer there don't be afraid said an angel he is not here he is risen at this the woman remembered that jesus had told them that he would rise again on the third day and ran to go tell the disciples what they had seen and heard huh and then for the next 40 days jesus appeared to his disciples and many others and showed them that he was alive and well he taught them that what he did was the only way that they could be forgiven and be with god forever for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life [Music] i love the story of easter today we learned that jesus came to set us free from our sins by taking our place on the cross and dying for our sin so that we could have everlasting life jesus didn't stop there on the third day jesus rose from the dead giving us new life in him could you please bow your head so that we can pray god thank you for it today thank you that you loved us so much that you died for our sins and that you didn't stay there god but you got up you rose again so that we can have freedom in you we love you god thank you for just allowing for us to have time with our families and our friends god even if it's even if we have to watch him on our tablets or our phones god we appreciate everything that you have given to us in everything that you do for us and we honor your name on today and it's in your name jesus christ that we pray amen [Music]
