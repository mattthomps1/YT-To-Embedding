pastor here and i'm excited you're with us today and i believe that god has something in store anybody an expectation that god's going to do something today anybody right there i'm believing it to be so i'm believing it to be so i'm believing it to be so i'm excited y'all i'm excited because i believe god is doing something god is doing something in you which means god is doing something in our city because you are the extension the bible says for he is the vine and we are the branches and from that branch we produce fruit and so what i believe is that in your growing and in the teaching that god is placing on the inside of you is that you're going back out into the world and you're making an impact and a difference one little moment at a time one fragment at a time at your job at the park at the gym at starbucks where you getting your frappe latte cote cute i don't know i don't order from starbucks let me not mess it up because i might have a bucky that gets mad at me so but here's what i believe is that as the sea that's inside of you is going into the world it is transforming and as you're transforming those around you are transforming they're noticing there's something different about you there's something that god is doing on the inside of you and so i'm grateful today that god is willing to be present in us i am grateful that god is willing to use us and i am grateful that god sees so much greatness in us that he would be able to send his son jesus and that today we can be the products of his resurrection listen i'm excited y'all if you will help me let's jump into the word of god today i'm excited to see you all i'm excited for those of you that are online god bless you we're jumping into the word of god so you want to get out your notepads we say here that note takers are what world changers and we want you to get out your bible because we know that readers are what leaders that's in acts chapter two let's jump into the book of acts chapter two as we begin a new series called the movement the movement the movement i'm excited to be a part of that excited to be a part of what god is doing excited to get into this place where we understand that god has called the church to be a movement god has called the church to be a force to be reckoned with and i believe today we're going to learn a little bit about that acts chapter 2 verse 22 and we're going to skip through some verses and i'm going to teach a little bit today and and i want you to get this context where we're at in chapter 2 verse 22 i know you're looking at the scripture but let me get you just a quick account of where we are we are at this place where jesus has ascended after his resurrection into heaven and as his ascension has taken place he has told the disciples to wait in jerusalem for the holy spirit and he says and this holy spirit will equip you to do the work that he's called his church to be able to do and so there was nothing called the church it was just called the way somebody saved the way and the way it was about us moving forward and so i want to read from there and i want to get us a clarity and understanding about what god is really calling us to do acts chapter 2 verse 22 and it says this men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with mighty works and wonders and signs that god did through him in your midst now he's talking to those jews that are part and that are in jerusalem for the festival after they've received the holy spirit they were saying to peter and them y'all sound a little drunk yeah y'all sound like y'all trippy all in church up there flipping out and acting like y'all crazy and peter says this is not because we are drunk but he says this is the manifestation of the holy spirit which is manifesting itself through the speaking of tongues in another language and he begins to tell him he says this mighty work and wonders and signs god did through him in your midst as you yourselves know it says this jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men he says god raised them that's an important part god raised him up loosing the pains of death because it was not possible i need y'all to understand there is nothing that could hold jesus in the grave peter lets him know because it was not possible for him to be held by it he speaks to verse 25-28 and he begins to recount david's prophecy that spoke of jesus and then verse 29-35 he begins to giving quote back that david is dead it says we even know where david is buried he's on mount zion with the other kings he says but this jesus whom you crucified is no longer dead he is risen we jump to verse 36 and it says this he says so let all the house of israel therefore know for certain that god has made him both lord and christ this jesus whom you crucified it says now now now now when they heard this they were cut to the heart they heard and there was a cutting of the heart and said to peter and the rest of the apostles brothers what shall we do and peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you it says in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit it's for the promises for you and for your children and for all somebody say for all who are afar off everyone whom the lord our god calls to himself he was speaking something very new right here he says this is no longer just for you jews he says but this is now for a gentile group of people a people that were not originally included i am no longer just the god of israel i'm the god of israel and i'm the god of the gentiles anyone that's so far off he says i am their god verse 40. he says and with many other words he bore witness and continue to exhort them saying save yourselves from this crooked generation so those who receive the word were baptized and they were added that day about 3 000 souls could you imagine if in baltimore city that the word cut the heart of our youth of our adults of our children of our older people the bible says just in that moment 3 000 were saved at a population of 600 000 if god could just get in the hearts of people he could open the minds of a city and change what our government will never be able to do [Music] that's how powerful the word of god is that's how life-changing the word of god is i want to come from this title today it all hinges on this it all hinges on this can we pray father in the name of jesus we pray today that this moment that we have for you that it will cut our hearts for where there be maybe heartened hearts ego pride brokenness i pray today that your word not my word your word would cut through the hearts and that someone will ask today what must i do to be saved for we love you and honor you in jesus name come on somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much y'all y'all know what i do i love celebrating the people that make it happen here can you help me give it up for our dream team that's in the house come on y'all help me celebrate them can we talk a little bit today can we can we have an opportunity for you to tune in and and can we just have a moment of teaching that i think is going to be paramount to you understanding this gospel that jesus has given to us i really think it's important because what we're speaking to here is an event it is an event that is giving us an eyewitness account of why these men these men and and women included in the 120 that were in the upper room what what was the changing moment that happened in their life jesus told him as he ascended say in jerusalem therefore you'll see the holy spirit and you'll receive it and you'll be able to do great the bible says great exploits you'll be able to do great works within me but if we rewind the clock a little bit previous to this before the disciples were together there was an instance where jesus was letting them know he says i am going to die but i won't stay dead i will come back to life he says with all power in my hand this resurrection that begins to take place jesus says to them i need you to know i am the resurrection i am my life everything about me is what you needed and so if you could be honest if somebody in here told you i'm gonna die tomorrow but don't cry don't delete my instagram don't delete my facebook cause in three days i'm coming back you would take a minute and look at them and say who do you think you are you will have a moment to say listen i i know you think you you you pretty all that but i'm here today to let you know is that you can't raise your self it's got to be a power something more supernatural than what you think here's what happened is that peter as he's in this moment describing the events that happen the birth of the church is formed y'all this is where the church comes from it didn't come from a building it did not come from a sunday morning moment and experience the church was birthed out of this moment this moment that peter is speaking of is the resurrection of jesus christ can i tell you that in this moment that they have no bible to reference can i tell you that can i show you that in this moment where peter is coming from is from a testimony of experience anybody know about a testimony y'all we know about testimonies they don't sound like testimonies but they're testimonies if you have a yelp on your phone you know about what a testimony one thing i know is when i go out i want to get something good to eat anybody with me when you travel you're looking for something good something that is really delicious and you've got to go what to where somebody is saying and proving that what it is that you're about to eat is good you need a what a review you need what a testimony and i start going through and if you're like me you start looking at that two and a half three and a half stars the ambiance is nice but the food may not be that good and i've been to them places where it looked pretty but i left hungry you ever been there before a place that looked all good they got flowers everywhere my my wife and i we were we were traveling recently and she said let's go to this place and i said babe you know okay if you want to go and it got flowers everywhere one of the issues for me is that when a restaurant has too many flowers i'm going to be in the picture and all people are going to see around me is flowers i said listen here's one thing that's a requirement don't you take a picture of me in this garden of eden i want to enjoy the food and i didn't yelp it y'all cause i trusted my wife i trust my wife you know what i'm saying i trusted my wife but when i ate the food she asked me because when people testify y'all they like to prove a point you ever had somebody tell you about something and they ramp that thing up so much that when you finish they'd be like call me and tell me how it was because it's gonna be amazing and you go and you're apart and and you eat but you like it was okay you ever see the disappointment in people like they swear you down your taste buds are broken you don't know what you talking about that's the best food ever would they they start challenging you well what did you have no you shouldn't have got that you should have got the chicken and waffles because people want their testimony to be true what happened in this moment is that the testimony of the disciples became a part of what we now know as the bible but there was no bible there was no book to go back to matthew was matthew peter who gives the account in the book of mark to mark about the story peter didn't go back to mark and read and say remember this no no no he recounts the psalm of david but he says i want to let you know the reason i believe is not because the bible said so he said it's because i saw it as an eyewitness i'm getting to something y'all because this is important what you've got to know is that our belief as a church is not wrapped up in what the bible itself says it's wrapped up in the testimonies of men and women who recounted he was crucified i saw him i watched him they put the nails in his hand but as thomas said i need to see proof and when he came back he says i can testify this is jesus who was resurrected from the grave we didn't have a bible they didn't have a faith that was based on matthew mark luke and john because they were matthew mark luke and john they didn't have a scripture to go to they had a faith because of a testimony somebody say i need a testimony your faith is not wrapped in the bible your faith is wrapped in his resurrection and his resurrection is the convincing point that now i take what the bible says and it's inherency as truth of what i believe it's not because the bible says so we love to sing that's on the b-i-b-l-e yes that's the book for me i put my trust in the word of god i put my trust in the word of god but do you know why i put my trust in the word of god it's because of the testimony that he rose from the grave my faith is not in books and scriptures my faith is in the testimony that god is real and that he sent his son jesus to die for my sins and because he died for my sins i actually believed that he died and rose again so when people tell me you know there's something broke about that bible you know there's some inaccurate places here's what i know to tell them there was a man by the name of jesus who came out of nowhere through heaven and she what was an immaculate conception and when he found himself speaking he declared i will die one day but i will what rise again and if any man can tell you when he's going to die and rise again then i tend to believe that he's got to be connected with god himself so i believe in the resurrection not just in the bible the bible is the testimony of the resurrection why is that so important pastor it's so important because where we're going in our world you're getting five-minute sermons and two-minute sermons online that are sculpting your faith and you're listening to people because we have access to everyone everywhere and everyone's opinion if it's convincing enough feels like it's something you should accept because now it makes sense when i go back and read it the problem is is that like even before and past time there was an honoring of god's word because people did not have as much access to the bible they just believed the bible is the holy word of god most people have not read it through most people have not walked through scripture most people just believe that this is what god says here's the counting product of that is that now we have a nation that can be swindled upon the voices of those who have good speech and convincing words and because we have not read the bible we don't understand the context of false prophets and people that have come in to destroy the work of the gospel of the testimony and eyewitnesses of those who experience the resurrection for themselves now that's why we have a generation that's walking into schools and the professor is telling them there is no god and they're walking back saying i don't know what to believe anymore because it seems like the bible is broken and because i don't have enough bible understanding on the inside of me i'll go with the most convincing word but the problem is it's my faith is not built on the bible my faith is built on the resurrection [Applause] it's built on the resurrection well pastor how do we know about the resurrection without the bible because the bible didn't happen until the fourth century the resurrection that we're talking about that happened around 33 to 35 a.d this resurrection was preceding the bible which means there were manuscripts that were laid out until they were all put together there was no such thing as an old and new testament there was no bible for people to break in and open up this happened in the time of constantine where they started allowing scholars to put together the word of god and create what was considered the old testament and the new testament two separate covenants but there was no bible their faith and the faith of the church cannot be based upon a book that it was not built on it's tricking you isn't it wait what what do you mean see here's the problem we're acting as if the apostles story was connected to the scripture but there was no scripture for them to be connected to it was about a testimony and it was about a resurrection that they saw for themselves so their faith was not based in the inerrancy of what other people thought or then the accurate processes of what an atheist or somebody who was disconnected from god wanted to be able to give to you their faith was in the eyewitness account that jesus rose from the grave [Applause] see the reason i can believe the word is because i believe the one who is the word the bible lets us know in john 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god i'm trying to teach you something here because you've been looking at the bible and saying well i don't know pastor and i'm not sure and you've been putting your faith and what you don't know so when you don't know you go to it to exercise your own beliefs with not knowing and not studying so now we have a shaky faith you get where i'm at because we don't understand and we say i've got to understand before i believe and the scripture says no your believing will precede your understanding i'm trying to teach you something today let me tell you why so you don't have to be so wishy-washy in your faith when a moment happens and you don't know how to reply really was jonah swallowed by a fish like is that really what you telling me the bible is saying there's this man named jesus who predicted his own death god raised him from the grave so guess what if he says that i'm going to read that a fish got swallowed that a fish swallowed the man then guess what i'll just go whatever he's saying and understand that when i get more connected into his word i can understand biblically what that means but the problem is we have broken scholars and broken knowledge that's trying to teach us in the three minutes because we set no side of time because we've been searching on youtube for something to define what i wanted to define instead of us believing in the resurrection i know some of y'all just looking like what in the world but i'm trying to tell you how the church started the product of the church is that they started getting together and connecting we'll talk about that discipleship but when they started saying hey they they got together and they prayed together and they started passing around they didn't pass around the bible they studied the word together y'all like oh they were studying the old and new testament there was no new testament there was no old testament there were the writings of the jews and those writings weren't the bible they were the scriptures that god had presented and put together for the children of israel your faith at his resurrection and his resurrection is your reason for believing it all hinges on that what if you walked away today and said i don't even know if i ever believed in the resurrection because you've been trying to follow a book without following the book's author can i frame this in a way that now we understand why the church is a movement and we understand what scripture came to give us insight to if you understood [Music] that peter is giving us this idea that jesus has been crucified and his crucifixion and resurrection is the reason we're here you understand matthew 28 and 18 and it says this and jesus came and said to them somebody say all all authority and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to who all authority on heaven and earth has been given to jesus so the authority to start a church without a bible is jesus prerogative he said i'll just do it let's start a movement wait jesus what are we going to tell the people tell them what you saw you know why it's so hard to convey your faith because you don't understand your testimony if you had a testimony you have faith that's connected not to a page but to an event that's connected to an event that's the reason that you even have a faith that brings about an understanding of the things that god has done in your life the reason you can be healed is because of the resurrection not the bible i am having a good time up here why because i'm recognizing my faith is connected to an event not to the components i don't understand so where we have christians and non-christians alike trying to prove scripture to be wrong we don't understand that while you're proven scripture to be wrong you're going against what you think is your faith but your faith is in the resurrection pastor how can you prove this well i thought i would let you know first corinthians chapter 15 verse 14. here's what paul writes and if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith did john grass what he just said like have you yeah like what is this what is this he says not if the bible not in scripture he says if the resurrection has not taken place all this i'm doing all this yelling is what and you with your committed hearts to jesus your faith is what so you have a useless faith you're like no the bible he's like no the resurrection you're like no the things that all the rules he's like no the resurrection he's like no like you don't understand like we based it all on what he's like no the resurrection everything goes to the resurrection everything is counted back to the resurrection everything is about the event the resurrection if no resurrection no faith no resurrection no church [Music] [Applause] so the movement that we're talking about i want to get you amped up so that you believe so much in the resurrection that you're searching the scriptures to understand what his word says about that's why the bible becomes so appetizing to some because to some it's a brutal beating to others it's more information that's connected with the truth of the resurrection that gives us hope and life and gives us direction of what god says about my life the resurrection is about this moment of understanding that following everything after it what is jesus saying that i have and you start to begin to understand oh this is the instruction guide for me to possess everything that he has that came from what the resurrection of jesus so now that we got that out the way here's what i want you to understand that his resurrection can do for you it changes point number one your eternity [Applause] scripture lets us know ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 through 6 but god being rich in mercy because of his great because of the great love which he loved us even when we were somebody say dead you like i wasn't dead i was alive pastor i walked in last night what are you talking about you were physically alive eternally dead he says even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus pastor what's the heavenly places what did the bible say he was going to do he said i'm going to do what prepare a place for you so what does that mean it means that my eternity changes from an eternity broken in hell to an eternity and living life to its fullest with him why is this so important because i have something to look forward to when this earth's problems don't seem to end the way that i want them to end when things don't come to a head where i want the wind i've lost loved ones and i'm waiting to see them again he says i want to let you know the pain that you're experiencing is only but for a season [Applause] it says it's only before season it said paul calls them these light afflictions why because he understands through the resurrection the resurrection tells us that jesus ascended and he ascended to go into heaven and when he went into heaven he's preparing a place for you and i to dwell when he comes back for his church so through the resurrection i have hope in his second return in his second return comes hope hope one what hope that i have a new life in him hope that i understand all sickness and sadness will go away hope in him that when i sit with him i'll walk in the pearly gates and he'll say well done thy good and faithful servants he's changing my eternity if you understood the resurrection opened the door to a change in your eternity you would never look at it the same again you will never mock between the things that you feel and the things that aren't right and the things that i just don't want to do you will understand i'll get over this feeling in heaven i'll let this thing go in heaven this sorrow will pass in heaven why because he's prepared a place for me it changes my eternity it changes the way i look at life some of us are so consumed with this world and the things of this world that we have no clarity and understanding that there's something else to look forward to are you living your life today like your eternity has changed or are you living your life today like it all stops here if you're living your life like there's an eternity changing your life you would start seeing god when i come in i've got to have some receipts oh i want to talk about some receipts listen i want to help you understand today that i need some receipts why because receipts tell me what i spent my things my time my money on when you got receipts anybody know about when tax season comes you got to prove what you spent you can't be up there lying come on brought this for the business you didn't buy that for no business this food right here is meaningful oh my no mean food you ate by yourself you need receipts to prove what you spent your money on souls are the receipt of the believer you need some receipts when you get to he's not interested in how much you made he's not interested in your good works he wants to know who did you speak to and give a testimony as peter gave in the book of acts that said men and women you were lawless in crucifying him but i shared with you today there is another option you can have jesus as your savior that's my receipts because the well done that good and faithful servant won't be about how i drop clothes off at the goodwill it'll be about the souls that i impacted it'll be about when i walked into the coffee shop and i heard the spirit of the lord speaking over me and i went over to somebody and said can i just lay hands on you real quick i just want to pray i'm not being weird i'm not being crazy but i believe this is one of my receipts that god is holding me responsible for see if we understood our gifts and our talents and our salvation was wrapped up in us having receipts for the work that we've done here on earth and that we're depopulating hell to populate heaven then we would understand there's a greater work than what i got my degree for there's a greater work than what my money is bringing revenue back on i understand that the good things that he gave me is to change the life of the lost sir ma'am i want to let you know this jesus whom they crucified was once dead but he is risen again and i have proof according to the documents of eyewitnesses not the bible but the documents that let us know he was once dead but he is alive again my question is when you walk into heaven will you have receipts for what you've done god is not interested in how well you pray and how well you read he's interested in that reading and praying actually changing who you are so that you become like him and that work makes an impact in the difference can you imagine that you have not given yourself over to the work of god that you have not given your life over to the purpose of god and the receipt that you lack is the legacy of your own family if we did we would stop being so choicey in the way that we're bringing up our children and the way that we're talking to the next generation we would make it an urgency because what you would see in your child is that receipt that i've got to change your eternity so that you can see jesus when i see him it will make a difference when you sing when you shout when you play when you're working when you're volunteering you would see eternity as the goal not the idea of oh i feel like it today you know what would change your mind if your relationship was built on the resurrection because when you go to that point to say do i feel like it today guess what happens you go back to the resurrection be like i gotta remember what he did for me see it changes our minds one thing i understand is that when i leave here my physical body dies but i understand eternity my soul goes somewhere y'all this is a real thing it's a real thing there's an expectation that our eternity will equal out to the work that was done through our lives through the manifested presence of who christ is and this resurrection has now given me hope that i'll see him one day i can tell you today it's changing your eternity he's changing the way you see when you know that eternity has changed you want to change someone else's what's your testimony today hey listen i gotta let you know this saint jesus but the bible listen man i don't believe in that bible i'm not asking you to believe in the bible i'm asking you to believe in the resurrection i'm asking you to believe in the eyewitness i'm not asking you to believe in church i'm asking you to believe in him who was raised from the grave we're trying to convince people about the bible in church but the problem is is we're not convincing them of the testimony the question is do you have a testimony because without a testimony you don't really have a purpose for seeing the reason of praying for 21 days what's the purpose of that well if i understood that jesus was raised from the grave then i will understand that he says now what all power is what in his hand so through that power jesus said what the same power that raised jesus from the dead is the same power that lives inside of me then if i understood that i would understand the working of the power of god is in me when i flow and when i do it's no longer about the laws it's no longer about church preference it's no longer about what i want to do i understand that there's a power that is expected to happen on the inside of me that brings about a result that changes the world around me and i'm no longer sitting there going back and forth about what the bible says i'm living out the belief of the resurrection [Applause] so now my hope is not in your opinion my hope is in the belief that christ has raised from the dead point number two it gives you a new life anybody can use a new life sometimes and by knowing you go look at your credit score you can look at a new life you ever been there before i've been there before i pulled up my credit report says 16. i'd be like 16. sometimes i look at my past and say man i wish i could change some things but the truth of the matter is i can't so what i have to do is believe in the resurrection which gives me clarity to understand that now i can believe the scripture which says all things work together see i believe in the power the spiritual power of what the resurrection does so now i can believe anything that happens whether it be good or bad whether i get injured whether i get hurt whether something happens it works all together for the good and i actually believe that the broken things of my past can actually be added and credited to me to be used for the receipts as i'm ministering and talking to people about the testimony of what jesus has done on the inside of my life i actually have a story the thing is is that the unchurched world is running into a church world that doesn't have a testimony it just has a gift and they're unimpressed because they see the same gifting lie on the outside world but the problem is is that the testimony is what defines them if you go a little bit further in scripture you'll learn that uh peter and john they go up to the gate called beautiful to a man who's lame and they raise them from the dead and they're like listen don't get filled up with the attraction of what happens he says this is jesus who did this you keep understanding all that is prepared and available for me is through me understanding that god wants to do bible says exceeding abundantly above all that i could even ask or think some of y'all are reconsidering them what am i doing and i'm here today to let you know god is saying you have to change your primary focus to it being all about you to it being all about him romans 6 and 4 says this we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father we too might walk in newness of life newness of life new hope promises new identity you go to ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 it says you're a masterpiece the problem is you can't believe you're a masterpiece because you look like another pitcher and you're greater than what you set yourself up to copy you're original you're one of a kind you're unique there's a new life that god has for you oh god just calling me to do what everybody else does no he's not but when you think that way then you have nothing to live for because now you're understanding you're just trying to get out of where you were and god says i've called you to do greater things than that i came to give you a hope and a future but it's like really anybody ever thought i've done so much that there's no way i can make an impact at this stage and i'm here today to let you know that's an absolutely false assumption i tell you about real quick about a man named saul real quick there was this guy named saul he's persecuting the church having the church members tortured as this movement was going the problem is is he didn't know he didn't know this church couldn't be broken but jesus got to him and said paul why are you persecuting my church paul looked up and the bible says within a day somebody say in a day i want to let you know and i just want to speak over somebody's life right now that whatever you've been troubling you whatever has had a hold over you in a day god can change that thing right now whether it be an addiction whether it be a way of thinking whether it be a broken mindset within a day the bible said saul went from being a persecutor to a presenter and he began to tell them the testimony of the testimony because here we go well pastor all we've got to do is believe the people that that were there but i don't know if they're telling the truth paul had to believe the truth why because paul said i know about this jesus and he'd be given to give an account that's so much so that he wrote most of the new testament and when paul says i'm giving the account on the account because i didn't even see jesus raised from the dead if i saw him i'd probably put an extra nail in there if you really would agree with me but because of the power of understanding that he was resurrected from the dead and this whole thing that has been put together it's all about him coming dying and rising again i tend to believe that who he is is who he says he is so paul says i'm changing my ways and i'm walking with newness of life and i'll die for the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation what makes a movement so great it's when i have a belief that's greater than what i could even imagine or think it's wrapped in resurrection and our last point is that through the resurrection it gives me the ability to impact the world it impacts the world you're around what do i want to get to you in this moment the resurrection is in context in this moment is to change you here can i tell you how important it is to understand what jesus did it's the difference between you consistently walking away from your faith and putting jesus a second our worship team said we're going to set out of time for jesus we're going to make him what first the hardest thing about making jesus first is when you haven't chosen to believe who he is if you're trying to find the brokenness of god's word through the bible and through your lack of knowledge you will always doubt his ability to impact your life you will always believe it's beyond that's for somebody else that's for somebody else to do that's not what i'm called to do that's for them i'm here today to let you know this gospel is for you tell your neighbor this is for you jesus was resurrected from the dead has come to your world so that your world can be impacted and you can change someone else's world i'm not leading you into a religion a church a bible i want to lead you into a movement that encourages your faith beyond what you could ever imagine or think it pushes you back to the place where you say why did i get my heart to jesus in the first place why did i accept him [Music] why did i allow him to come in and if he's not changing me then is he really in today somebody has to open the other door anybody remember back in the day you probably got one but i used to have a screen door anybody remember a screen door on the house it's the door you look out of when you yell at people but you don't want to be close to him you know you open the door what do you want but there's a whole nother door right there you're pushing against it you're talking through the grid of it some of us while we've opened one door to god we've left the other door of our hearts shut i'll do church uh you know i'll try that 21 days thing and i'm here today to let you know it's more than a 21 day thing it's a belief that jesus jesus died and he rose and from that belief now i jump into this word now i open my heart to what he has to say because if not all of my skeptic ways all of my conspiracy theories all of my processes and my thoughts that make me doubt they'll take precedence over god's word can i tell you believing in the resurrection it all hinges on it it changes your eternity it gives you a newness of life and it impacts your world today i want to let you know you're a true world changer but today we've got to not grab the scriptures we've got to grab a hold of jesus and the bible says those scriptures are a testimony to who he is not a book to read about what he's done we're not reading a story we're testifying to a story [Music] this is what he did in me i just want you to take a moment and think about what has he done in you what's your testimony because your belief can't hinge on what you can understand your belief in jesus has to hinge on that you know he's the resurrected king and when it hinges on that can i tell you everything is up for grabs i don't care what it is today i want to let you know that it all hinges on this your doctrine won't be swayed your beliefs won't be swayed you'll say some things like this honestly i don't know [Music] but here's what i believe that jesus came he died and he rose with all authority in his hand so whatever he says i'ma get in trouble whatever he says i'll do problem is if i don't know what he says through his word and i haven't spent time with him in prayer guess what i don't know what to do so i create my own pathway and foster my own thoughts and i live beneath the purpose that god has established for my life it all hinges on this he is the resurrected king
