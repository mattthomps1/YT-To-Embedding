and i'm the lead pastor here and i am grateful that we have this opportunity in time to build and to grow into what god has called for us to do i believe that this moment is a special and precious moment because i believe that god wants to change and to move and he not only wants to break the bonds and change that the enemy has said over our lives but what he wants to do is transform us and it starts in our minds and in our hearts today and so i believe that we we we've got something to do today we've got some work to get into but i i'm i'm excited because it's summer at the mick shaw we

mix week 2 and we're grateful and then also today after our experience we have step two of growth track which is discover your design and i believe today that god is just going to do a great work in the house how many of you are ready for the word of god can we jump into it today listen if you can open your notepads open your bibles we want to get into god's word here we say that notetakers are what and readers are what readers are leaders so we first have got to read this word of god and the bible says if we hide the word in our heart it will give us the power the sustaining power to not sin against god and so john chapter 11 verse 17 through 27 we gonna read and it says this now when jesus came he found that lazarus [Music] had already been in the tomb for four days it says the place where lazarus was was bethany and it was near jerusalem about two miles off it says that many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them concerning their brother so when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him but the bible says but mary remained seated in the house martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died but even now i know that whatever you ask from god god will give you jesus said to her your brother will rise again martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day and jesus had to clarify to her that the resurrection wasn't an event but he said to her i am the resurrection and the life whoever believes in me though he died yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die and he answered this question do you believe this she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the christ the son of god who is coming into the world i want to come from the topic this morning let god off the hook let god off the hook can you just tell your neighbor real quick say neighbor let god off the hook can you turn to your second choice and say neighbor let god off the hook can you turn to your third choice and say i'm sorry you're my third choice but let god off the hook let's pray today father the name of jesus i pray that you would do something in our hearts and our minds souls and even in our physical bodies today being in your presence we're declaring that you're the god of all things you are chiron you're a god that's more than enough you are the god that provides you are the god so we need provision greater than the physical things we need your provision of peace and joy and understanding and direction so i pray god that today you would provide for us clarity of your word in jesus name somebody say amen amen god bless you thank you musicians uh also i i miss a couple of sundays but i want to give it up for the best dream team in the land can y'all help me celebrate our mixture team that makes it happen around here thank you so much listen i i i'm thinking through what we were talking about on last week if if you don't know what we were talking about on last week you can go and see and connect with but we were talking about understanding the seasons understanding my season what is god saying for me because can i tell you your season is different than those that are around you your season looks different depending on where you are in life depending on what god is doing in your life seasons are different and in seasons i'll never forget i came to high school if if you're older you remember your high school days remember going in remember trying to make a mark and and trying to tell people about who you are now i'm not gonna lie to you your your high school days may have been just a couple days ago your high school days could have been a couple years ago your high school days could have been a couple centuries ago i'm just saying whenever it is you remember your high school and i'll never forget the idea and the understanding of of going to school and when i was in school i i i wanted to make a name for myself i didn't just want to be amongst the crowd and so you know charles i tried to do something and i don't even know why i came up with this idea but i started wearing slacks and khakis and i said i'm never going to wear jeans to high school isn't that crazy i'm going to tell you it's crazy because i don't know why i did it but i i tried this thing out you know oftentimes i think we we have to put ourselves in a place where we try some things out that bring us to a level of discipline because many of us we go from thing the thing without being consistent and i said i'm going to try this and i'm never going to wear jeans in and people started to notice see here's a little tidbit real quick that you can write down people notice consistency when you're consistent with something when when when consistency is a part of your life and and as you grow in it people noticed that you've been doing the same thing and you've been consistent with it and and in that consistency comes an outcome a return on the investment of consistency and so i wore them and people noticed and they started asking me questions why don't you wear jeans i said because this is my brand this is my reputation in order for me to stick out honestly um you know i knew i wasn't going on the basketball team immediately and uh and and while you know i was a pretty good student you know that that i just knew i needed something else so the the best thing in my creative mind that i could come up with is don't wear jeans now i wasn't saying i was a genius at it but i'm just saying i tried something and i got noticed for it and i began to have a reputation as being the guy that doesn't wear jeans can i tell you today that your life has built a reputation can i tell you today whether you know it or not your actions or your inactions have built a reputation over your life where people have counted something to the quality of your living something different about you something unique about you something that is specific about you you have a reputation you may have a reputation of being consistent you may have a reputation of being inconsistent you may have a reputation of being a little haughty you may have a reputation of being humble and if you do have a reputation of being humble you're not walking around telling people you're humble but you have a reputation tell your neighbor real quick you got a reputation you got a reputation you probably talk too much you got a reputation that you're a little bit nosy in people's business you got a reputation for being generous you got a reputation for being on time you got a reputation for being late you got a reputation because you cry all the time you're always whining about what's wrong you got a reputation because the consistency of your life brings a reputation i can count on you but i know not to call you but there's a reputation to your life can i tell you that at this point in the book of john jesus has a reputation jesus is known he has built something a part of his life in his consistency of who he is becoming as his purpose is developing and progressing he has a reputation he has a reputation for going to weddings and when the wine runs out all he does is say keep the party going and he taps on the water and new wine comes out can i tell you he has a reputation and when he begins to talk inside of a house it gets so crowded that people have to rip off a roof in order to be able to get the sick on the inside jesus has a reputation and his reputation precedes him his reputation is a component of who he is his reputation speaks about his life his reputation is a good one can i tell you today that jesus has a good reputation whether you believe it or not whether you found it to be so or not jesus has a good reputation he has a good reputation of waking you up every morning despite how you act despite if you give him thanks despite if you're ready to be able to be woken up despite if your coffee kicked in this morning jesus was gracious enough to be able to wake you up he has a reputation of being a forgiving god he has a reputation of walking with you in the valley of the shadow of death he has a reputation of being god and god alone he has a reputation that even when you don't see him he is right there he has a reputation it has a good reputation there's a good reputation even when he doesn't answer your prayers like you like he has a good reputation even when you don't understand his actions he's good he has a good reputation even when he gives you a promise but you haven't seen the manifestation of it i want to tell you that he has a good reputation our god is so good at his reputation that that people look to him they pray to him that that people acknowledge his presence that people look for him to do and to move he has a reputation he's generous to you and you're generous to nobody else he has a reputation of blessing you when you don't deserve to be blessed he has a reputation of giving to you even when you hold back from him a god has a reputation the bible lets us know there was a man that called out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and the bible says he has a reputation of opening the eyes of the blind the bible lets us know that there was a young child that was in a coffin that had died and there was a funeral procession and his mother was weeping and jesus touched the casket and the baby came back to life he's got a reputation but what happens when jesus reputation doesn't look like you wanted to look and that's the question that we're dealing with today when god is doing things and moving in the world and you're praying but you're seeing things happen on a consistent basis that looks like the enemy is winning and it looks like the enemy is gaining crown and you forget what god's word says it says in this life you'll have trouble but you forget he already said take heart i've overcome the world i've won this thing already even though things come up on your screen even though a notification popped up on your phone he said i have overcome the world but the problem is is everything that happens that is not to our liking we check jesus's reputation when things happen in schools when children are hurt when when when when cancer takes over when when when our money is funny we begin to question god's reputation and the reputation that we question is he's still good here's the problem is god says i'm always good i'm this is who i am it's the nature i cannot change my goodness but the problem of it is is that i'll question god's goodness according to what i asked him and if i ask him something and he doesn't do it is he still my god can he still bring me out can he still change my life can he still make me new and the question that i want to answer to you today is god can do anything but fail but can i talk about the season of your promise where god is speaking over your life where god is telling you that there are things that he is going to do in your life that you have never seen of and you have never heard of and you hear god give you a promise but the thing is is that the manifestation of the promise is taking too much time anybody know about that anybody know that god showed you something but you're like where in the world is it i've been praying i've been seeking your face it's been years i've been offering i gave like the pastor told me to do and i have not seen the results of it jesus i should be at the front of the line when it comes to blessings and prayers i'm giving i'm serving i'm attending what in the world am i doing wrong and jesus said there's a promise there's a process and there's a promotion and if you don't get it right and get the clarity of it what happens is is that some of us have made temporary seasons into permanent situations and we come to the book of john anybody know this story it's about mary martha and lazarus jesus is people like this is his folk y'all when jesus is at bethany guess where he goes mary martha's house guess where he eats at mary and martha's house can i make this relatable when everything is going down when jesus is moving guess where the anointing flows out of you out of you you you feel god's anointing when god is moving in the building guess what happens he uses you he uses your voice he uses your talent he uses you but here's the thing when i go to ask god lord will you show up the lord seems to be death to my request the bible says mary month to talk about their brother they're lazarus lazarus is like jesus homeboy like his homie like the one you know what i'm saying like he's with him he's connected lazarus what up jay what's good they tight stay together they're doing life together and mary and martha when lazarus gets sick they immediately say just call jesus because because because he said if you ask you should receive it if you call on him he'll be there and and you just ask him right and when you ask him he'll show up the bible says they give word jesus lazarus is sick when i read earlier in the scripture and they told jesus we want to let you know lazarus is sick the bible says jesus got into a place where he was trying to figure out like cool that's that's cool lazarus is sick and everybody's like he should get there pretty soon but when we get into verse 17 the problem is is that jesus is four days late for something that's dead and when jesus is late for something that's dead we stop praying because we forgot he's the resurrection in the life and we think things are dead in our life because god gave us a promise but you forgot that god can fulfill the promise because you thought that according to your level of relationship would be according to the level of how fast god moves here's what i want to let you know you can do your daily devotional you can pray and god still is on his own timing and you might turn to yourself and say well why do all of this is he going to do it on his time anyway because there's something that god does on the inside of you while you're going through process and the time of process gives you the ability to be able to withstand as the bible lets us know be not weary and well doing for in due season ye shall reap a harvest if you think not the problem is is and when i'm not in the process i think every time and i go back to the drawing board of looking at the promise and believing it's the promise even for me and he said if you could just wait and walk through the process i would give you everything you need but the problem is is that we're at an urgency and we've got four days ahead of us and lazarus is dead so jesus will you keep what you said your word you keep your promise the bible says when jesus kids get states see jesus y'all he's something else he all walking in strolling hey what's going on everybody y'all good good to see y'all today i hope everybody is well and the bible lets us know that as jesus was in the area it says mary and martha they knew jesus was around and when mary and martha knew that jesus was around the bible says martha moved it says she went to him that's good you got to hold on to that because even when it seems all is lost when jesus is in the presence of his people there's always something he can do that's supernatural we said it exceeding abundantly above all that you could ask or think they just wanted them to save lazarus from being dead jesus said i'm going to do something better i'm going to raise him can i speak to somebody that something's dead in your life and you've given up on it and you moved to a new promise but god said i haven't even resurrected the promise that i had before and you're trying to move ahead because it's taken too long for you to get where you are but jesus is saying today that promise that i still spoke to you we can't move to the next promise until we fulfill this one because your promises are in order according to your level of maturity and you can't move to another level of promise without going through the process that is for the season that you're in tell your neighbor real quick you can't skip the process that's what messes us up we go all right lord this promise i don't want it right now let's go on to another promise and let's work that one out and god says no no we're going to stick with this promise and we're going to stick with this promise until you get it so that you can become who you're called to be because i won't move you any further into who you think you should be until you get this part of your life down back but there's a process somebody say process and the bible is letting us know that we have to have the faith to believe but here's what i oftentimes believe is that in this story we get offended when god doesn't move when we want him to move can can can anybody be honest in here that you get a little bit angry when you prayed and god has not answered your prayer anybody been in urgency before can i get some real people in here that can talk about the urgency of what you had and that thing has been dead for four days four years four months 40 days and you have let it go and say i don't even need this thing anymore i'll move on to something else but anybody understand that god can resurrect old things and make them new and i'm here to let you know that sometimes things die in the wilderness season so god can raise it back up and let you know it's him but whatever god is giving you be careful oh joe be careful that when god brings the promise to promotion that you don't become disobedient to the blessing he gave you because you're so anxious for it that you move out of turn because what i understand is that if i don't stick with the process i'll be disobedient to god's plan and i'll mess up what he's trying to do don't be too fast in your promotion that you become disobedient to the promise that god set you got the job but now you're not giving you got the promotion but now you're too busy to spend time with god you got in the relationship but now you're sleeping together and going off the path that god had oh can we hello hello hello whoa hello is it on is it on because we like to ignore those kind of things i've been waiting i've been praying this is who this is what god gave me and we're disobedient in god's blessing and promotion that now we begin to destructively ruin the promise and we start to have a sarah spirit just sleep with hagar because god's taking too long on his promise so i become god for my own promise and to make it happen i place something in the middle of it which now becomes what a distraction to what god's called me to do so we need to uh move out of this place and understand god's calling me to something great how do i get myself into the right process and to the right place so that god can use me and move in my life the way he wants to move here's the thing i've got to let you know is that you have to come to god even when you're angry because the bible says even though lazarus was dead martha still came it was good if you understood mary because mary was the one we celebrated that was at the feet of jesus waiting lord i want to hear your word but here's the thing sometimes the thing that is celebrated can be also the thing that gets us in trouble because while mary was good to stay at jesus feet she was stubborn to move when jesus came into the midst and the bible says mary stayed where she was until she got a special request from god i'm here today to let you know is that the reason that we're finding ourselves drowning and not believing god is because we have blamed god for where we are how we feel and what we're experiencing and today i want to let you know you got to let god off the hook to see the true transformation take place in your life because whatever god is doing it's not his fault it's a part of his plan so here's three things i want to give you real quick to help you understand how important it is that when we're talking about this idea of walking through a promise a process and our promotion and i'm telling you seek god diligently and you walked out last week was like seek god diligently can i ask anybody real quick do you have a problem with your time with god in the morning don't raise your hand don't raise your hand don't worry don't put it down keep it down keep it down keep it down keep it down and seeking god diligently sounds good but the problem is is that you don't really believe in the value of it because god didn't answer your last prayer so why pray now because you're skeptical if he'll do what he even said he would do can i dig real quick to let you know that while we believe in god we don't believe god we believe in god there's a god there's a higher power there's the lord almighty he's great he's good and then the bible says and he can do exceeding and abundantly all right wait uh okay how far should we go because i'm going to let you know the level point in where you believe in god it's the point where you took over so in order to seek him diligently the first thing that you've got to do is put yourself to the side and you have to point number one come to god see the bible says martha came when jesus was in the area but the problem was is mary didn't and mary is basically like i don't believe him because he had the power to change it and he didn't and what happens when you believe god in the most crucial set of circumstances and he did not come through the way you wanted can i be honest when you have a reputation of healing everyone else and you don't heal me i stop trusting you and there's a seed of distrust so i take over the process and i put myself in place of god because i can move faster than god can move but i don't get the same results that god gets and i'll try to resurrect things but the only thing i can do is give it cpr i want to share this real quick i want you to get this coming to god is so important because coming to god has to push you beyond your level of what you believe even though you've experienced something that is not actually based on how you feel god should have reacted to you something happened in your life i don't know what it was something broke your trust with god and i want to talk today if you can walk through the process the process is so connected to what happened before and if you don't believe god can do it before then what you'll do is believe in god but you won't believe god just ask your neighbor real quick do you believe god that's tricky because you can believe in but your circumstances can make you doubt him can we be honest real quick anybody got a problem with that sometimes i believe in god but i don't know if i believe them here's the thing here oh here's how you can tell you can be like no i'm just not disciplined and i'll be like no you just don't believe if you're not praying come on y'all looked at me like what you believe in god but if you believe god you would pray according to what you believe that he can do anybody got a situation that you need god to change in your life can i see your hand right now anybody need god to do something my question first question put your hands down first question is have you prayed about it have you been praying part two have you been seeking him diligently for if you seek him you'll find him so there's a difference between lord help me and lord i'm gonna spend time until you give me direction my question is do you believe god enough to seek him not to get his opinion this question are you up in the morning asking god will he do it or have you taken over and you only need god for the parts that you can't handle do you believe in god or do you believe god that's a question you need to write down the question mark do i believe in god do i believe god do i believe in god or do i believe god because if i believe god then when the bible says you asking you shall receive when when when when when when i believe god i believe that he can cure cancer so i'll pray because i'm looking for him to change it my question is where did you lose your trust with god which prayer was it what happened where did you lose it because here's the reason you're not earnestly seeking after him it's just because you don't believe him this is real y'all and here's what i want to share is real because we don't know the seed rest inside of us so we are believing that we're at a good point because we believe in god i come to church i serve i'm making it happen i read my bible if you follow me my devotions are consistent but have i come to god have i come to his presence scripture says in matthew 11 28 it says this can y'all do something with me can y'all read it out real quick with me we're going to turn this way all right let's read it together one two three come to me all who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads and i will give you rest action neighbor real quick do you believe it that's his word are you trying to decide now whether you believe him or you're trying to convince yourself that believing in him is enough because if you believe him see here's where church works against us because we believe the activity of attendance circumvents the responsibility of relationship and we set ourselves in position that as long as i come all the things that god promised to me should happen but the problem says you gotta first come to me can we put that scripture back up real quick it says you've got to come to me all who are struggling hard and carrying what heavy loads and i will give you what says it right there says come to me but how many of us are going to go back home and try to fix it ourselves he said come to me you going to your girlfriend he says come to me and you're looking for your parents to fix it he says come to me and you calling your homeboys up and he says come to me all somebody say all all who are struggling hard he didn't say what you're struggling hard with he said all who are struggling hard come to me guess what he didn't say i'm about to prophesy for myself he didn't say come to me because i can't solve it he said go to him and we got everybody else on our five faves calling them talking about can you give me a word the word is go to jesus just tell your neighbor real quick i got a word for you go to jesus because i'm struggling hard myself [Applause] [Music] i want to help you but you go to him he'll give you some rest cause you're wearing me out i went to him yesterday seek him diligently i was on my knees all week congratulations holla at me next week because i'm going to tell you go to him he says come to me i got you i'll take care of you make sure you're good i'll take the burden off i'll remove that burden that's upon you he said but you got to learn what go to him not attend service pastor i need a word this sunday the word is to be a representative of christ and to speak to what he's already spoken let me put that pressure on me tomorrow i'm coming for a word today i need a word i'ma go like this well for 10.99 on amazon you can get a bible and that bible can give you all the words you need but what you're not gonna do on sunday when you've been missing for nine weeks is come to me and talk about i need a word i need one too cause i got some stuff that i'm struggling hard with and that i need god to move in my life with tell your neighbor again go to god cause you getting on my nerves of y'all want to say don't say it but you want to say it you want to text somebody right now just go ahead i ain't going to feel offended if you pull your phone out pull your phone out real quick and be like go to god don't text me no more this week go to god point point number two as you're going to god he wants to bring healing so be healed some of us have been delivered but not healed you're not back in the addiction you're not back struggling in the relationship but you talk about your past like it's your present because you know when i used to when you used to what again because you remember back in the day back in the day what stop reliving your past like it's your present you can't get through your season of process by processing another season you got to process the season that you are in so be healed walk through your healing because you know the church hurt me you ain't been to church in 10 years and you're still talking as if it was yesterday i'm sorry that whatever happened happened but here's your responsibility is your healing you do not get off by claiming your brokenness and talking about your hurt without walking through your healing did the church hurt you today oh no i love my church oh my gosh then be healed but some of us are holding on to our past with a present mindset that keeps us from moving forward pastor you don't know the level of my hurt i am not asking you to take your hurt and throw it to the side as if it doesn't exist but what i am saying to you is that you need to walk through healing remembrance in itself is not healing talking about it over and over is not healing it's finding out where is the wound over and over because you know that's why you know that's why i don't talk to people cause cause what because you know when i every time i talk to people that you know every time somebody they act like they're your friend i mean if i don't hear there's 9 million times they act like they're your friend but then they they change up on you yup that's what people do be healed and stop walking in your brokenness as if it is your path to god some of us have been gloating about our hurt for so long that now we're celebrating it instead of being healed from it tell your neighbor real quick be healed you gotta walk in some healing you got you gotta you gotta you gotta get healed you can't keep being afraid of an addiction that you haven't been in in 10 years stop being fearful of it and be healed god has healed me if something ever happened to me i'm in his grace and he'll walk me back through it but stop being afraid of your past that's affecting your present bible says in james chapter 5 verse 16. it says make this your common practice first thing i need you to do is confess somebody say confess confess your sins to each other and pray there we go there we go we got to pray you talking to your girlfriend she ain't praying you talking to your homie ain't praying you're talking to people in your life they're not praying how can they help you we got good advice nope he says confess your sins to each other pray for what each other that means you have to be in community with other people who pray even you introverts pastor you know i don't like people i don't do a whole lot of people i want people you know it's kobit out here put your mask on and pray with others but the problem is is you don't have an exchange happening the bible says pray what confess sins pray for each other i'll need everybody in my business you ain't got no business it's the same business you've fallen on ten years ago get some new business pray for what each other real quick assessment look in your circle and see who's praying for you no no no no no no not who going to church with you not who hanging with you not who using their gift with you who is praying for you if you got a spouse confess your sins and pray for each other you know i messed this up i jacked it up but confess somebody say confess and pray confess and pray confess and pray so that you can live together what whole somebody say whole and what whole and healed so we don't keep getting your pass every time you're in your present hold and heal somebody say hold on somebody say heal tell your neighbor real quick we got to get healed we got to get healed we got to get healed i know that divorce wrecked us we got to get healed i know that death left us messed up but we got to get healed i know that place where we are but we've got to get healed for it says the prayer of a person somebody i got some folk prayer for you that's all over the place oh man the prayers of a person somebody say living right with god is something what powerful to be reckoned with i was going to actually do something then i thought about i was like that's not right i was like turn to your neighbor ask him are you living right no don't do that don't do that don't do that because you can't pray for me if you ain't living right you know how i know you're living right because i'm in your life because we're what confessing sin is the one y'all trying to figure out how this thing work and think it's complicated god says i'm teaching right now how to get out your mess the problem is you won't confess it to anybody that can be in relationship with you to pray about it so that there can be power in that prayer you don't need church people you need people with relationship with god because a church person has great attendance a person that's living right before god has power choose power over attendance because most likely a powerful person is attending go back to your work powerful powerful person is in relationship with god somebody say point number three [Music] you got to start believing god again not believe in god you have to believe god again because you stop believing what god could do anytime i'm still reiterating my past i haven't given my past over to god so it means i'm still working through it and i'm still making it a part of where i am it it still becomes this whole thing of the way i'm living my life out and i'm here today to let you know i'm here today to speak i'm here today to speak over your life and say you've got to start believing god again not believing in god i'm not here to ask you do you believe in god i'm here to ask you do you believe god [Music] the bible lets us know he can do anything but fail do you believe god again stop being impressed in your own belief [Music] in god and start saying i want relationship with god i want something that's transforming me and changing me something that's not putting me on the attendance bracket but something that's placing me in the state of where i need to understand do i believe god again do i trust the promise he spoke over my life do i walk through the process that he gives me do i understand the promotion that's in my life and how to be able to be a steward over what he's blessed me with you gotta believe in god again proverbs 3 and 5 says this trust in and rely somebody say confidently on the lord with all somebody say all your heart and do not rely on your own insight or understanding stop relying on you as your source but trust in the lord matthew 11 and 6 says this it says in blessed happy i might say happy fortunate and to be indeed is he and she who takes no offense at me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through me and is not hindered from seeing the truth the bible lets us know that jesus cousin john the baptist

understand when the weight seems more than i can bear when when the notification pops up and there's something else that is broken in our world and people are dying he said still even in the midst of

speak this over your life today if you could just let god off the hook if you could stop blaming him and and giving him the charge of where you're not at it and what things happen to your life and be able to be released and say to god lord i know i come to you i want to be healed and i want to believe you again if you'll do this for me you'll change me and make me whole
