into the word of god i believe that god wants to speak in this place let me introduce myself my name is marcus england and i am the lead pastor here at the mix and i'm extremely grateful to be a part of this church and all that god is doing i welcome those of you that are in person it's so good to see you i welcome those of you that are online all around the world it's good to be a part of your homes and wherever you are in this moment we're just believing god to do great things and i believe that god has a word we're still in our series lessons i was trying to get out of it i really was and i told god i think i've learned all the lessons that i can and the lord said you still got some lessons to learn so i figured if i'm going to be in it so are you so uh we're gonna get into the word of god matthew chapter 25 that we're going to read today and i want to speak a word and i pray that this word and its totality can bring freedom that you not just get locked in on one aspect but i truly believe that god has the ability to change our thinking many of you god has brought freedom but many of you are not walking in freedom and so while god has brought freedom we want to walk in freedom i don't want to just be saved i want to be saved and transformed i don't want to be religious and churched i want to be brand new in jesus christ today and so what i believe the word has the ability to do it has the ability to change us not just to free us but to change us somebody say change i believe that is the power of the gospel of the good news that it has the ability to change us into who god is calling for us to be and i believe today we're going to explore that in this moment matthew chapter 25 we're going to read 15 verses today so if you haven't read your bible this week great catch-up time because i believe we're going to read all of these verses today let's start at verse 14. and the bible says for it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted to them his property if you have a bible there and you have the ability to underline it with a pen you want to make sure you note that his property it says to one he gave five talents to another two to another one and to each according to his ability i want to pull from right there because everything that you have now is according to the ability of your management stop looking for other people's resources finances and lives to live off of and to look at as something that you desire today i want to let you know you have everything that you have the ability to manage in your hands right now it says then he went away he who have received the five talents went at once and traded with them and he made five talents more so also he who had the two talents made two talents more but he who have received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his masters his master's money now after a long time the mass of those servants came and settled accounts with them and he who have received the five talents came forward bringing five talents more saying master you delivered to me five talents here i have made five talents more his master said to him and we will know this verse quite often because we hear this it says well done good and faithful servant this is the only place in scripture where this phrase is mentioned he says well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful over a little so i will set you over much enter into the joy of your master and he also who had the two talents came forward saying master you delivered to me two talents here i have made two talents more his master said to him well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful over a little i will set you over much incur into the joy of your master so he also who had received the one talent came forward saying master i knew you to be a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no see so i was afraid and i went and hid your talent in the ground here you have what is yours but his master answered him you wicked and slothful servant you knew that i reap where i have not sown and gather where i scattered no seed then you ought to have invested my money the scripture is very specific to money not to abilities to a money and it says with the bankers and at my coming i should have received what was my own with interest so take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents for to everyone who has will more be given and he will have in an abundance but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away we thank god for the reading of this word i want to talk from the title this morning what's the big deal what's the big deal can we pray father in the name of jesus we thank you so much for this moment and all that you have done we thank you for your grace your mercy and your love father we want to know today what's the big deal what's the big deal about understanding and honoring you in all that we do help us to get clarity of your word and help us not only to be hearers of your word but to be doers in the name of jesus christ we all say amen amen thank you so much musicians i really appreciate you i say this hourly thank you so much everyone who is a part of our dream team our dream team is a group of people that come together to make things happen here at the mix and i'm so grateful for every volunteer and team member here mix family can we celebrate those that are part of our dream team i'm so grateful for every person all of you make the difference what's the big deal anybody ever just ask sometimes people that that tend to to get over in life they get upset about things they they get a little bit over over extended in the way that they are trying to uh give you a communication that things don't seem to be as big as everyone makes them out to be anybody ever found yourself in the place where there was a certain way you wanted things a certain way that you wanted things to happen and and in that way things were happening people did not see the big deal you you've ever found yourself that you place your phone on the left-hand side and and you place your coffee on the right-hand side and somebody comes and messes up your stuff and you can have a little bit of an attitude anybody know about that you you like things the way they are anybody like things the way they are you ever want to tell people sometimes don't touch my stuff i love you i like you we are tight but what i need you to understand about me is i don't need you touching my stuff i need you to handle the stuff the way i gave it to you if i gave you the call back listen i want to let you know when you go and rent a car they say the way in which we gave it to you is the way in which we want it returned i don't know if you've ever been there but i i you know you give your kids the car or you you loan them the car and and and and you come back it's halfway on e and then and and you don't know anything about what's going on when you get in it had a noise it didn't have before i never forget when when i was uh uh uh moving into my driving phase of life and um one thing i uh it's so funny that the things that bother you are sometimes the things you did yourself anybody know that you know about that like you you've got this irritant but the irritant comes out of you did the same thing i never forget having my mom's car and and and and and she was driving it and and and she said you know what we have an extra car so i'm gonna lend this car to you and and you're gonna be able to go with it and the idea is that when i borrowed the car i would return it in the same way and condition that it was given to me i might have done it on the first time i drove it because i didn't go far i might have drove it on the second time and and came back and it looked good but when i started getting comfortable and thinking that it was my car i started doing things in my car that were a little bit out of my realm of being able to handle you whip the corner but you forget there's a curb there anybody ever been there before you whip that corner you feel that boom and and you look and you're like oh that's not good you you ever find yourself you're driving and you hit that that pothole that you saw but for some reason in the world you thought you had the ability to just glide over it and now all the bottom of your car feels like it's one boat from falling apart you ever been there before well that was me i was driving the car i'm i'm hitting curves and corners faster than i thought i could i'm racing people i'm doing things as a new driver that i shouldn't be doing eventually finding the car in such a mess that my mother eventually said to me you know what it's yours i don't even want it because it's not the car that i gave you let me tell you what the first problem of my mistake was is i forgot that it wasn't my car the idea is that because of continuous driving and and because that i had the ability to be able to to use it whenever i want it because i seem to have control because i can let people come in and come out of it because i could go where i want i mistakenly thought that the car was minds and the way in which i used it and the way in which i handled it and the way in which i operated was up to me i forgot to look in the glove compartment inside of where the manual is because if i looked inside of there it would let me know who the insurance was under and who the owner of the car was and what i want to let you know had i remembered that more often i would have been more careful in the way that i used the car not expecting there would not be consequences for the actions of using it inappropriately the question that i'm asking myself today is do i understand that what i have is god's can i say to you today that everything that we have that everything that we own that all of what we are doing in this life it all belongs to god [Music] the scripture lets us know that there is a parable a parable is a story to give you an emphasis in teaching that jesus tries to use in this moment to give clarity to where uh the people are he wants to explain to them about finances he wants to explain to them about the management of their finances i want to let you know kingdom principles are principles that help you operate in a place where you have given your heart to god and the rules look a little bit differently than how you used to operate without him so now we have what is setting up is jesus is letting this story and he's putting it together he said i want to let you know that this is what it's like it's like a man who gives these gifts these talents he gives them out and according to the ability of each person what i want to let you know first off that this story is jesus talking to his disciples letting them know this story is about me he says i want you to know i'm going away and there's something that i'm going to leave you with but you must learn how to somebody say manage now i want to get you in clarity of this management is important because if you know how to manage it means you know how to use properly that in which has been given to you you can take the resources of others and use them in an efficient way to bring back return on that which has already been given to you that is the area of management the management in everything we do in our life here's what i want to let you know is that our life basis is built upon management if you look at where you are in life today it's based on the way in which you have managed your life anybody know when they got that that that stimulus check no don't raise your hand but some of you got two or three of them you don't even know how you just kept saying you know what i don't care let them keep coming stimulus checks ppp loans grants all of these things came in over the year my question is are you any further [Music] than where you were before you got them because the context becomes is that god has plenty somebody say plenty god has plenty the bible says he has riches but i want to let you know you do not get an opportunity to indulge in the length of the riches if you don't know how to somebody say manage ah management is such a huge part of kingdom because god has called for us to be managers over the earth he spoke to adam and when he created adam the bible says now eden was created and now there could be growth in eating because there was someone to manage the ground if there is no manager god does not produce once you get this it's going to change your life let me tell you why because you're praying for more but god can't answer a prayer for something you can't handle the reason why god isn't giving you the more in your prayer is because you haven't learned how to manage the little that you have the management of the little brings about the production of the more management draws more to you if you can manage it you can handle it if you can handle it you know what to do with it if you know what to do with it god can trust you with it stop thinking god's against you and doesn't want to bless you and you're praying for a miracle to get out and god's been trying to give you a miracle to get over it's not just a miracle to get past and a miracle to get out of the negative again in a miracle just to get the rent do and a miracle just to get over god's saying i have more than you could imagine or think but i cannot give you more if you do not know how to handle what you have a question of somebody say management you don't have to get mad at your neighbor because they have more what you need to ask yourself the question is is am i managing what i have in my life properly for god to bless me with more so that i'm not asking him and getting angry for something that i don't have the ability to handle myself today i want to let you know that god has not given less to you god has just made the statement that i'm not going to give you more until you learn how to manage what you have somebody's trying to figure out what do i have i can walk up and and talk to a couple and say okay tell me what's your expenses and what's your income and then tell me what you have left over um so what you want me to do is like add it all up uh yeah how do you know what you're spending if you don't know what you have god is saying i'm trying to teach you principles so that you stop getting frustrated in your devotion and in your prayer time because you're asking me for things dude that do not manifest and the lack of manifestation is not because i don't hear you it's because you have not taken time to hear me that what you already have is enough for you to manage and until you learn how to manage more i can't answer the prayer that you're praying your prayers aren't broken it's your management skills that need help if i learn how to manage properly god can what hear and answer my prayer i don't want you to stop praying and getting frustrated because you believe god is on you're not on your side what i want you to understand is that god is on your side that god wants the best for you that he's called you to be more than a conqueror that he has greater for you that he has blessings beyond what you can imagine or think but i cannot partake in that that which has already been declared in heaven and to produce on earth if i don't know how to manage can i tell you that the reason we don't like management is because management demands work and some of us have gotten religion and religion has made us lazy you need a blessing pray for it you need your bill pray for it need deliverance pray for god says you cannot uplift or build a community on my miracles and your lack of management you cannot change where you're going you cannot uplift your family you cannot put yourself in a different position you cannot build upon my kingdom you cannot go any further than where you are with miracles because miracles are not teaching you the principle of management and if i give you another miracle you will waste it away anyhow so the blessing of a miracle is not going to be for the benefit of all it is just going to keep you for the moment of what you have and it will never be able to multiply itself into a new place to be a blessing to someone else i told you before in genesis chapter 12 that he spoke to abraham and said i'll make you a father of the nations i'll bless you but your blessings are for the purpose to be a blessing to someone else god is not blessing you to keep for yourself and the quality of your management is important your management of money goes with your management of time which goes with your management of resources which goes with your management of your emotions which goes with the management of your mental state which goes with the management of your physical body they're all connected and you keep operating as if they're separate and god says listen if you're emotionally distraught then the money that i give you is going to go to the wrong place anyway and you're going to waste it so i need you to manage your life i need you to manage your life i need you to manage your expectations i need you to manage the thing the problem is is management requires process and process takes time and i don't like time because i'm in need right now the problem is that i keep getting a need because i don't know how to manage could i possibly throw this to you that god is more interested in blessing you with abundance then blessing you out of need guess what happens when god blesses you out of abundance it speaks to his reputation and his reputation says i have good managers on earth when god has to bless you out of need every time you pray it says that i have managers who are christians who don't know what they're doing with what i gave them and it speaks against the reputation of what god wants to set forth of who his people are god wants to look good in the earth to let those know that when you come with me there's a change in who you are and how you live and the way you operate but when we get with christ and we don't allow the principles to be able to change us from the inside out and we don't just get deliverance but we also get freedom and god says you make me look good because now my name has been stamped on you and when you go around people say well wow how did you become so successful and you can say god showed me a new way [Applause] i'm successful because i understand i'm successful the bible says he gave one five talents and he multiplied it says he gave another two and he multiplied it he says but he gave one one according to their ability it says because he knew of his ability he only gave him one and even with the one he was not able to bring anything back to the master but what he had already given him my area of concern is that god is trying to teach us a principle but we're trying to be at times overly spiritual and to spiritualize our lives without practical principles to be able to guide us to where we need to go so we're going to shout a blessing through we're going to speak in tongues a blessing through we're going to roll on the floor to bring a blessing through instead of getting our health together we're going to pray that god would just heal us instead of us eating right i'm coming to worship night because i need a miracle no what you need to do is stop eating the way you are so you don't have to deal with what you're dealing with i need god to break through and give me a miracle financially no what you need to do is stop spending uncontrollably and not having management issues and be able to live below somebody say below your means instead of every morning getting up and asking god to pay for something that he's already giving you money to pay it with don't feel spiritual do it because what god is requiring you to do is what he required adam to do which is to manage the earth that he had given him dominion over you don't understand that genesis lets us know that we have dominion over the earth but the problem that i'm lacking is that i've lost my dominion and now i become lazy and i'm expecting god to give me a miracle for every moment the miracle for every moment means i do no work god does all the work i learn nothing no one actually gains anything and we become spiritual so i don't have to learn anymore i don't have to read anymore i don't have to think anymore i'm in jesus he gonna do everything yep holy spirit gonna do everything gonna pay my bills and we've created god to be our sugar daddy instead of our lord and savior [Music] so we use prayer as our process to not do what we know to do with the information that we have to do it with and then we fall into what adam fell into which is a spirit of blame adam the bible says in genesis the lord comes to adam and says where are you as he goes down listen what what's what's happened the woman you gave me the woman you gave me jacked this up i ain't asked you to give it to me i didn't i didn't i didn't say nothing god's holding you accountable for what he's giving you yet you're blaming others for the reason you don't see the manifestation of what he called you to and so today what's the big deal the big deal is that god has greater can i tell you this is that if you learn how to manage what you have you would see the greater this scripture is talking specifically to money but i want to veer off to the side and say this what if you just learned how to manage the little bit of joy that you have wow what if you secured that thing on lock and key what if you kept that thing so tight that you didn't allow a circle a group a post anything to get you off because what you said is i will protect my joy at all costs how do i manage joy pastor i watch the environments that i go into that suck it out of me i watch the people that rob me of it every time i get in a corner with them i go into areas and it takes it away from me every time i go to work pastor they're in my cubicle then you protect it at all costs when they come in speaking you just might start getting the holy spirit immediately oh glory and they say you know what i'm gonna cut what am i doing i'm protecting it at all costs [Applause] i'm trying to tell you if you understood its value i just got a little bit so i'm going to protect it today i'll speak in tongues over it i'll cover it with oil i'll put something on the top of it if i've got to kill a lamb or go and spread the blood at the top of my cubicle i'll do whatever i gotta do to protect my peace for today you're not gonna kill me around here no you're not not gonna take my joy what if you protected your peace that way you won't snatch my piece today no no no no you getting loud on this phone click up no not today [Applause] it don't feel the same effects like it used to when you could slam a phone down all you can do right now is be like beat it didn't really get the effect that i wanted [Music] but my question becomes what if you protected the little that you have the little house the little room the little car the little amount of payroll that you get if you protected it and managed it so well that god says because you managed it so well i'll give you more for the little that you have my question today is that god wants greater for you but what will you do in order to receive that greater what sacrifice will you make in order for that greater to manifest itself one of the things that i believe is so important that you must understand is that when you start finding yourself chasing after something you're in the wrong direction because whatever is for you should be chasing after you you can write this real quick but money is attracted to management not waste people don't like sowing into people who waste people like sowing into people who multiply so what do you have the ability is a question for you to write down what do i have the ability to multiply what do i have the ability to make more of do i have in me the ability to create more laughter more joy around people more opportunities do i have the ability to increase my what value my net worth that what i have becomes a blessing to others that so many other people needed sometimes you just need certain people in the room because of what they can do to transform an area that's good i don't know why they keep asking me to come i don't know what i don't i don't even know about this what is this no why because there's something that you offer that has multiplication to it and the multiplication gives you an ability to fulfill the assignment that god has placed in your life in such a way that god has given it to you now you can multiply it for that which can be multiplied more can be given off and our points today i want you to get a clarity from point number one is that i need you to get this so that you can see in your life initially what we're talking about with this text is financial movement management and understanding that moves into a new place the first thing that i need you to get clarity of so you can settle your spirit is that you must understand the management threshold understand the management threshold what is that it is the way in which i've had the ability to manage what i have i have what i have because of the way in which i know how to manage it if i manage it well that means that more can be multiplied here's what i want to tell somebody today stop getting mad because of what you have learn how to manage what you have and watch it multiply that's why the world even understands the principle of it if i manage it well i have the ability to see it multiply if you ever want to ask yourself this question why is it multiplication taking place in my life there must be management issues i've been doing everything right can't be can't be i don't even know what i'm doing pastor that's great bible says if you manage it well even that in which you don't know how to do the bible says god will approve why because he told the last one with one talent he said this to him you could have at least put it in the bank for it to gain interest to bring back return on it you can do somebody say something i can do something stop measuring it with other people stop measuring it with other couples stop measuring your house or somebody else's house stop measuring your car to somebody else's car stop measuring your clothes to other people's clothes manage what you have man i'ma wear this thing i pick on charles a lot cause one he sits in the front two i just love him a whole lot and one thing i know about mr charles i i don't care if he's doing outreach i don't care he's at church mr charles is always wearing his best it's together it's armed don't look like somebody jacked them up and pulled them out the house there's a clarity and intentionality in the way that he lives because there's a representation point to understanding somebody's name is on my life so everything i do has an opportunity to produce something more in that person's name so i must be careful pastor here's what i got to understand do i have to do it for people no you're doing it for god because you represent him as the bible says as an ambassador so an ambassador does not keep their own selves and all of their ideas when it comes to who they are what being therefore they do what they have the opportunity to speak on behalf of so your concerns don't matter when you're an ambassador god don't care about me god cares but god says guess what i need you to learn how to manage when you don't like it wow some of you are already thinking about christmas what i'ma get i wanna get it for spending money you don't have to prove something that nobody cares about i'm not gonna talk about your children because that would be bad but some of you are going to buy something for these children that haven't done nothing [Music] nothing and you're about to reward them as a bad manager so god says cool you're about to take your money and spend it and that's your management and here's what you hear said on the other side and that's why these young people are the way they are they're the way they are because of the managers in their life where they coming from they came from you we got bad children we got bad managers bad managers don't know how to multiply they'll satisfy for their own purposes what happened i never wanted to say no what happened i didn't want to hear them cry what happened i didn't want them to be mad at you go get some friends so that when they get mad at you you have somebody else to talk to besides your five-year-old this is my best friend this is sad you should reevaluate your life the scripture says in matthew chapter 2 in matthew chapter 25 i got to go get spiritual again come on y'all uh in matthew chapter 25 verse 23 it says this commending his servant the master replied you have done well in proving yourself to be my loyal and trustworthy servant because you were faithful to manage a small sum now i will put you in charge of much much more you will experience the light of your master who will say to you enter into the joy of your lord you have to understand your level of management and stop taking on and saying yes to things that you cannot handle that make you look bad here's the thing have a no in your pocket because of how well you're doing in your yeses don't have no's and you're doing horrible in your yeses as well do great in what you said you would do so that you can be able let me tell you real quick why many entrepreneurs never start off as entrepreneurs because god is more interested in seeing how you do with other people's stuff you like i want to start my own guys like um hold on before you start your own let's see what you do with theirs you stealing paper paper clips pins taking the computer home talking about you working you not working your child on there playing video games and then you're talking on the side i don't want to understand why they won't promote me because you're not a manager and god's like you want me to give you your own but you won't manage someone else's you haven't learned the principle you must understand your management threshold so here's what i need you to do stop praying for more and go back and make sure that what you have is being used properly know your expenses know your income know how much you're going to save know the goal in which you're getting to know how to budget if i don't know how to budget google it if i don't know how to google it find somebody that looks like they have money if they look like they have money but they don't find somebody else because some people look like they got money and they will joke you quick yeah you oh no okay no that's all right that was okay that's that's okay [Music] can i tell you to understand your management threshold point number two identify oh no i'm sorry i switched them up on my own learn no no no let's go to there we go identify ownership that's right what you have to understand is that you don't own anything you are a somebody say manager write in your notes i am a manager i am not an owner i am a manager i manage what god gives me that's why he doesn't mind giving to me because i manage it now i understand ownership the bible says that he left them with what he gave them they what took his talents everything you have is god's the bible lets us know in psalm 24 and 1 the earth and everything somebody has to underline everything the earth and everything on it belong to the lord the world and its people belong to so him in case you want to get out of pocket and be like ain't gonna be controlling my life fyi you're his already the earth is the lord's everything in it and the people belong to him as well wait everything everything there is nothing that you've created job said it very clearly naked i came in this world naked i leave the lord giveth and the lord taketh away job humbled himself in reality and said blessed be the name of the lord i didn't have anything coming in and i'm not going to have anything going out so obviously it means if i didn't come in with it somebody gave it to me which means i'm a manager not an owner a manager understands that there are penalties to when i mess up something that isn't mine the penalty may be i don't get any more until i learn how to manage what i already have let me throw this in there for you for those of you that have a uh a complex in the way in which you think about giving to the church point number one money's not even yours point number two if god never gave it to you you would never have it point number three when you give and you find yourself giving to the church you're not even giving yours you're giving god back what he already asked of you i don't feel like i'm give god all my money your money it's not your job it's not your money it's not even your skills it all belongs to god i must identify ownership when i start identifying ownership i start taking care and managing that which god has given me with the heart of thanksgiving i started saying lord i thank you for this i understand all of this is not mine so i take care of it stop getting angry at people who take care of what they have you be like stop worshiping your car no you stop banging it up we would say the oh geez i'm gonna give that to you for those of you that don't know it's like the original gangsters the original people you would see them outside in the morning in my neighborhoods washing their cars every rim they would have armor all on it they would have air fresheners on the inside that would make your eyes water why because they understood about taking care of what they had my question to you is are you proud of what god is giving you when you're not proud of what god has given you then you waste it away and you care nothing about the way it looks and the way that you handle it and it is a picture at times till you have too much so you think it's easy and replaceable so you treat it any kind of way we have culture diversity can i tell you that that's why we're called the mix and we have this lean to the left lean to the right black white rich poor and we go to this place where we say well they care too much about stuff and they care too much about the way that they and it's like yup yup yup ours is better because we don't care about that that way and then another group goes over and says look at that if you really care then this is the way you hand you don't have to care about that that kind of way you you don't have to look at it that kind of way and then you have another group that says well the more that i flaunt it and the more that i and and i show everybody the more that i think i'm better and i want to let you know that to take care of something is not to worship it but not to obsess over it is not to not care can we can we can we throw in the middle that just because i take care of what i have and i like something nice it doesn't make me conceited in myself but the fact that you chose something different doesn't make you better can we be okay at a cultural divide that when i pull up in in in in my car that may have leather seats and you pull up in your car that has no uh engine in it and it's in his hybrid and his hybrid you don't think you better because i spent you get what i'm saying can we just understand that god said he blessed me with it i'm okay with it i take care of it don't judge me on it that's real because in the world we live in today we have our biases and we put the labels on people according to the way they want pastor drove up you see him that's how them passes due what so if i drive up in a hybrid and steal the money it's better no no you know i forget it y'all don't even want to be real because that's the way we think if he drums up with something pouring rickety he's not stealing and i can have all the money in my account and you judge me because you thought your bias was greater than mine that's a mixed moment for today point last point that we have is i want you to get this and get clarity in it learn to manage and give learn to manage and give i want to read the scripture for you in luke chapter 12 verse 16 through 21 it speaks to itself it says and he told them a parable another parable saying the land of a rich man produced plenty fully and he thought to himself what shall i do for for i have nowhere to store my crops and he said i will do this i'll tear down my barns and build larger ones and there i will store all of my grain and my goods and i will say to my soul to my soul soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry but god said to him fool this night your soul is required of you and the things you have prepared whose will they be so is the one who lays up treasures for himself and is not rich toward god [Music] my question today is god is not afraid of you being blessed god is not afraid of your wealth god is not afraid of your land god is not afraid of you doing well he just wants to know where is your heart today if you don't learn to manage and give you become one who manages for themselves to be the only beneficiary of what god is giving you everything that god gives us is for him and everything that we have for him he allows us to use it for ourselves and to be a blessing to someone else i want to let you know today the house that you got be grateful for it but god didn't just give it to you god gave it so that you could have someone else over so that you could pray for someone else so that you could be a blessing to someone else god gave you that car with the seventh row in the back that looks like a bus so that you could ask somebody after church do you need a ride home so that you could see someone struggling and ask them what is it that you need god didn't bless you with it for you to keep posting it so people could see how well you're doing god gave it to you so you could be a blessing to others the bible says that if you know how to manage the small then he'll give you much more today i believe much more is in store for you let's thank god for the work today hallelujah [Music] i believe in god's word and i believe in the word of god's impact on your life today and i believe that word can change you to be all that god has called for you to be let's pray today father in the name of jesus we thank you we thank you in this place that we want to be manager stewards of everything that you have given us lord we understand it's not because you're ignoring us but we understand it's by your goodness and love that you want to see greater you want to see an overflow in our lives today so father i pray that every person hearing this word would take a next step action to ask a question to connect with a person to say what must i do to manage what i have so god that you can trust me with more today for we love you we honor you and we thank you in jesus name
