team will be able to provide that for the church if you want to hear the first message in its totality uh but now i need to teach you how to fight i'm going to teach you how to fight i want to teach you how to not take no for an answer come on somebody i want to teach you how to how to go after god every single day i want to teach you how to slay giants i want to teach you how to see yourself as god sees you aren't you guys so grateful for this church amen aren't you so grateful for pastors marcus and meshi come on come on come on come on come on are we gonna do better than that let's thank god for our pastors [Music] bless you my brother i'm honored to serve alongside you i'm honored to call you friend i'm honored to do this thing called ministry and life with you and i can't wait to see what god has in store for this church and for you and your family and thank you for paying the costs thank you for sacrifice thank you for sleepless nights thank you for believing god when there was more month than it was money thank you for staying focused on god and and not what the people were saying and what the people are doing thank you for being a leader thank you for pushing us to be greater in the never settling for anything less than god has for us amen turn your bibles with me to numbers chapter 13 and i'm going to kind of review a little bit for the first like 15 minutes and then i'm going to land i'm going to preach today from the topic occupy if you're taking notes i want you to write down occupy i want you to write down occupy occupy occupy occupy i want you to know that there are some promises that god has for you there are some things that not only you pray that your great grandparents prayed that are rightfully yours i want you to know that the promises of god are yes and amen in christ jesus i want you to know that when god speaks a word the bible says that it shall not return unto him void and i want you to know that there is something called taken territory that happens only in the supernatural for things that are natural to happen now pastor how do you highlight that what are you talking about taking territory what i'm saying is is there some space in heaven that we are renting there is some space on earth that we are renting how many of you are renting you're renting right now like physically a house you're renting space well here's the thing about renting space you're gonna go home and you can move your furniture in right you're gonna go home and and you can decorate up into a point but you only have you only can decorate up into a point and only can do something up until a point because you don't have ultimate authority you don't have ultimate authority because you are renting and not owning and the bible says that he wants to move us from being renters to owners he wants to move us from being what the borrowers to lenders and i want you to know that this thing about taking territory means simply this and yes the lord told me for 2022. i always seek god for a word you know when i was pastoring our church i five i always saw god what's the word of the year for our church and i would always try to come up with something fancy make it rhyme come on somebody it's my time in 2009 2010's gonna be like back then yeah man just trying to figure out like like but this year the lord was like i ain't playing i was like god what's the word for me what's the word when i preach out and he said occupy it didn't rhyme with 2022. in other words he says there are some areas in your life you've been written freedom i want you to own it you've been written joy i want you to own it you've been renting deliverance it's been part what it really means is it's been part time you've been stuck in halfway i get a chance to travel and and and i hate uh layovers i want to get a direct flight come on somebody i hate layovers and there was this one time i went on a trip and i was in i was going to africa i was going to kenya and i ended up a layover in london i was in this layover in london and and uh let me tell you something it was amazing the gordon ramsay restaurant they had these big massage chairs i mean it was awesome and i realized something that that i almost missed my flight why because i got so comfortable in halfway i got comfortable in halfway can i tell you all the way is never comfortable wow oh all the way is is is never painless but it is purposeful and god says he wants us to occupy he wants us to occupy some territory in 2022. amen and specifically the lord told me that jimmy i want my people to occupy the territory of their mind i want you i i want them to occupy the territory of their heart with compassion i want my people to occupy the territory of their emotions and specifically with the word emotions he says i i'm trying to change their desires i'm trying to change their affections their the heart and the emotions i want them to stop desiring what has been and start pressing toward what could be occupy somebody say occupy it's almost like having a gift card have you ever had a gift card or or and you forgot that you had it or or maybe you used some of it and you forgot that there was still some money left on it there was one time that i had these gift cards and i forgot all about the gift card and i did a study uh last week do you know that there's 15 billion dollars right now billions somebody say billion 15 billion dollars that are in people's purse under the seat in their car in an old backpack come on somebody in an old wallet that they actually have access to a financial blessing it's in their possession yet they haven't utilized it they haven't occupied it and so it goes unused can i tell you that there are promises that god has given you that have been unused come on somebody because they're not for the season that you're in they're on the they're for the place that god has called you to be and so i feel like god's saying it's time for you to occupy the present it's time for you to occupy your purpose it's time for you to occupy the promise of god what i know is as i read scripture you know what god did really good that he only did once is create the heavens and the earth he created the ground look somebody just put your feet just just stomp a little bit come on stomp a little bit under that board under all of this is a foundation under the foundation is the earth the one thing that god is not doing is making more earth yeah come on y'all he ain't making no more earth he did it it was so good he called it good man look at that earth that i made but then he calls us to multiply it he calls us to better it and i said god when god gave me this word i was like how can i get this meaning down to the people that we're supposed to occupy territory that we're supposed to take a a space that we're supposed to have this jabez kind of deal that oh lord that you would bless me and and keep me and enlarge my territory have you all ever prayed the lord's prayer anybody do you know that football games every football game they pray lord's prayer and what they say is this our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven and then it goes when it says for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory amen that last phrase is a succession of things that are going to happen and for thine is the kingdom of power and the glory if you are going to walk in the glory of god you're going to have to own the power of god and if you own the power of god you're first going to have to establish the kingdom of god for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory in other words if the glory is just the manifestation of the promises of god if you want to walk in the promise of god you first have to have the power of god if you're gonna have the power of god first you have to establish the kingdom of god that's a big word kingdom but it's not a king james word kingdom is simply two things the king's domain it's broke down into two words the king's domain in other words the beginning of that prayer our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come the king's domain thy will be done right that's the jurisdiction of the or the authority of god here now watch this now if you don't own and you just rent it is impossible for you to put up a no trespassing sign for something that you don't own and why the enemy has been continually messing with you and continually in your dreams and keeping you up late at night is because you don't have the authority to say no trespassing because you have a renting mentality not an owning mentality and so that's why that thing keeps coming back at you over and over and over again because what happens is is you're trying to take authority but you haven't taken territory it simply is this the lord told me this year i have lost now a hundred i lost 150 pounds uh since 2017 and then i gained about 15 back and i've been in this cycle saying god help me help me help me help me help me help me help me to lose this weight and he goes no no i need you to help me and i said what do you mean he said a new goal without new territory is an old result and i said what do you mean so you know what i did this morning know what i've been doing i've lost 12 pounds since the beginning of the year how i had to do something different if you always do the things you've done you'll always get the things you've gotten it's insanity to do the same thing and expect a different result so what happens is every new year you keep saying this year gonna be my yummy i'm gonna lose weight i'm gonna get out of debt i'm gonna die then you end up right back in more debt but what happens you set a goal but i'll take a new ground new goals without new ground is old results i'm fast forwarding i promise you i'm a lander ship so what i'm trying to say is what i've done every day every time i get on my peloton [Music] i know it might be weird to you i start calling down heaven so before i hit go i got a thing on right now that's telling me how many calories i've been burning right now you know i started to prophesy before i got on the treadmill i started to speak in tongues before i got on the bike and here's my prayer god give me the strength to finish this workout and also the ability and desire to come back tomorrow [Music] and for some reason i've been doing it could it be that i'm taking territory spiritually so that i can have the strength to do it naturally and some of y'all may call me crazy but when i'm on the front of gq come on somebody i'm joking i'm joking i want to ask you something when's the last time you prophesied over your marriage when's the last time you were in a doctor's office and got a bad diagnosis and and and took authority right there in the name of jesus no weapon formed against me is going to prosper you ain't got to be weird you can just speak that thing in your head hey baba [Music] but what we have to do is we've become accustomed to this world and paul warned us of this we have adopted culture's mentality of breakthrough try harder get stronger can i just encourage you i've watched my wife beat addiction she is now six and a half years sober you know how every single day she takes territory yeah every single day i come downstairs 6 30 7 00 and she's down there praying prophesying god take the desire of alcohol away from me she hasn't had a drink in six and a half years but i see her every single day and i asked her i said honey why do you do this every day and she said this because if i'm not working on my recovery i'm working on my relapse [Music] [Applause] oh my god she releases her book in july uh called reframe the shame come on somebody and i'm so excited because i've seen her so what i want to ask you i believe sometimes god must be in heaven saying are they serious do they really want breakthrough because they're doing more complaining they are praying they're doing more talking to people about it than they are talking to the cloud of witnesses come on somebody like so how many of you this year want to step into the promised land that god has for you come on let me see your hand that's great i'm gonna give you four things number one you gotta take ground you gotta take ground this is not real ground this is a golf map there is something significant about taking ground there is something real about taking ground remember what i said god's not making any more dirt but yet he is calling us to expand the kingdom of god and if you read the old testament especially you will see that whoever took more ground come on somebody had more authority whoever had more authority was in the best battle position whoever was in the best battle position come on somebody won the battle that's how you may say well god man god showed up for gideon well how how does 300 people beat come on somebody 50 000 midianites devin you know how because they understood the process and the power of taking ground ground is significant whenever you see ground in the bible god is talking about territory it's not just physical territory it's supernatural territory are you with me and how do i know that because what is the bible says the earth is the lord's and the fullness there of second chronicles 7 14 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their heart no heal their mind no heal their emotions no heal their land in other words when i pray when i stop being so prideful seeking every solution but the solution of worship i don't take ground pastor how do you take ground i read my word i spend time in worship every single day watch this now i i i position myself my emotions my words and my mind to operate in the opposite spirit that the world would so i have to forgive when they deserve punishment that's taking ground are y'all with me obedience calls you to take grounds taking ground so we all realize that heaven is not a place that we're going to go to one day it is it's not just the place we're going to go to one day when we die heaven is a place we can have now because what we're asking is is to pray the atmosphere that's in heaven our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come i want the kingdom that is in heaven healing the perfect will of god to come to earth that's what i want come on somebody heaven was in my car this morning from annapolis to here man we worshiped nehemiah we prayed we prophesied we believed god for you today and so what we were doing is taking ground oh y'all understanding what i'm saying when you take ground you have authority when you have authority you have power when you have power you have what the glory of god the manifested presence of god that's why you have to realize that when you got saved you became a citizen of heaven when you got saved you became an heir of the kingdom of god are y'all with me now see back in the day pastor marcus i used to watch the best basketball player who has ever played his name is not lebron james his name is michael jordan he redefined the game right you can argue with me that's fine yeah it's kind of like you thinking that mike todd is better than bishop jakes bishop jakes went first come on somebody there and so what i'm saying is is this i'm taking ground now when i grew up you know what i used to watch come fly with me do y'all know what that is it was the first vcr tape of all of michael jordan's highlights and it was called come fly with me and when that vcr came out some of y'all like what's the vcr video cam i don't even know camcorder recording something like that video camcorder recording and it was big thick come on somebody like and you would pop that into the vcr and the remote control had a cord on it and you all had a remote control headquarter on it used to drag it across the room we didn't have technology that we had today and i put it in and you know what i saw michael jordan do all these highlights and when i saw michael jordan do these highlights the song came up like mike if i could be like mike and you know what i did i would go outside and i would try to mimic all of the moves come on somebody that michael jordan did anybody else do that come on somebody like anybody else bought some tennis shoes and you thought you were faster [Music] so we would go outside and we would try to be like mike the problem is is the rim was too high and we were too short to be like mike so in order for us to be like mike we had to bring the rim down to us and what we then i could dunk like mike then i could come on somebody shoot like mike but it required me to bring the rim down to me in the things of god when jesus says you shall do greater things that means you can part a red sea that means you can turn water into wine that means you can say to the mountain move and it can't be cast into the sea that means you ain't got to wait to church to get healed you can mimic i can be like jesus the thing that you got to do though is bring the realm of heaven down to earth come on somebody so now you can have the uniform on you can have the bible i'm preaching better than you're responding right now you can know all the words to the song but the last thing you got to do is bring heaven been taking ground numbers numbers chapter 13 is where we find the israelites the israelites are renting they were freed from egypt they were enslaved to pharaoh for over 400 years and y'all know the story the story is as god sent moses god sent moses to pharaoh to say let my people go thank you my brother cause we're gonna shout and this dude i gotta get there right he sent moses to pharaoh to say let my people go now moses was not pharaoh's likely was not god's likely choice moses wouldn't have been your choice you wouldn't have looked at moses and said hey moses can you go speak on behalf of god why because he was a stutterer isn't it crazy that god will choose come on somebody maybe you've dotted all your eyes and crossed all your teeth maybe you don't have a past but i thank god that god doesn't use me because of me but yet in spite of me i thank god that he doesn't call the qualified but he qualifies the call god sent moses through some plagues moses comes he's got the whole uh uh uh he's got the whole world in his hands and he stands before the red sea and the red sea needs to be parted and and he puts down his staff and the red sea opens up and he leads millions of people out of egypt and then god had a setup god didn't just free him but god also come on freed him from what was calling him and what was behind him the whole army tried to pursue the israelites and god closed the sea up and god said you shall see these enemies no more so if god said you shall see these enemies no more why does it take a nation who were enslaved for 400 years why does it take them 40 years on a 40-day journey now if i told y'all right oh well if i called past demarcus this morning and i said man it took me 25 minutes to get to church i was speeding don't judge me and i said hey man it's gonna take me 50. not 50 minutes but 50 years y'all would be like i don't even know if we're gonna be here then isn't it strange how when god promises us when god promises us something that we think it's going to take forever you know why because god freed them from egypt he got them out of egypt but egypt was still in them they had a renting mentality and let me know how i how i know that let me tell you how i know that because in this passage of scripture when god called moses to choose 12 leaders to go spy out what was next they complained they were scared and there was a whole generation that said this we would rather go back and be slaves because of the pain and the giants and how hard it's going to be ahead and i came to tell you this mixed church today there are some people that are among us that would rather have a guaranteed meal as a slave than to seek god every day for what he has in store for us what what you want to stay where you are god says no i have called you to occupy the land and so i'm going to talk about ground god says i want you to take ground moses 13 i'm seeing moses numbers 13 17-20 then moses said to them spy out the land of canaan and he said to them go up this way to the south and go to the mountains and see what the land is like whether the people there are are are strong or weak few or many whether the land they dwell in is good or bad whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds whether the land is rich or poor whether there are forests there or not be of good courage and bring me some fruit so first we have to take ground the bible says this the bible says this about taking ground we have to take ground if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways ii chronicles 7 14 i will hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their land could it be that our struggle has been because we have left the presence of god on the grounds of the church and haven't brought it back home to the ground of our homes somebody say take ground we have to take ground the next thing god gave me is grapes so ground somebody say ground somebody say grapes now watch this when those 12 they came to the valley of eshkol they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes right it was so large that it took two of them to carry on a pole between them they also brought back the bible says samples of pomegranates and figs this place was called eshkol which means cluster are y'all with me because the cluster of grapes the israelites cut there so here is a whole nation and they're standing between their prayer and their promise and they have 12 leaders that go and spy out the land and they watch this now they come back with fruit that god is in this they come back with a taste of the territory they come back with a sample of the soil now how many of you have been to costco and y'all everyone everybody everyone went to costco sam's club come on y'all groceries where you get a lot for less but they don't give you no bags come on somebody grapes they're good you know what i love i love cotton candy grapes y'all have those they are anointed 12 people have one cluster of grapes that's going to feed a million people 12 people one cluster of grapes four million people oh them grapes are big oh that breakthrough is amazing oh that church service was awesome oh pastor marcus preached heaven down pastor marcus can preach to you but your job is then to go feed the people that's behind you and around you one cluster can't feed 12 people not alone 12 nations y'all want one you know what's crazy about sam's club in costco i love going there because they got free samples and do you know i i like found out because my wife used to work at costco they only have samples for new products they don't have samples for old products because old products have been proven [Music] everybody want a new way to do it i believe this the anointing that is in this church is generational yeah i'm all for all of this new worship i'm all for that but i am nervous that my 16 year old daughter won't know nothing about the blood of jesus because hymns are are not being sung anymore i'm concerned that they don't know the words the greatest thou faithfulness yet they know the words to every drake song and and come on somebody in every kanye song and and i i'm i'm concerned that that that we are losing the strength where the faithfulness of god was not a new car it was not a new house it was not a new fit it was just contentment that if god did it before he is going to do it again don't be satisfied with the fruit that's in your hand when god has called you to the root that's in the soil you know what happens at costco i went there once and got so full off of samples that i forgot what i even came in the store for you know what the enemy wants you to do he wants you to get used to samples he wants you to stop fighting for a breakthrough he wants you to be okay come on y'all y'all know how we do well we say this in church i may not be where i want to be but thank god i'm not where i used to be and we say ah i may not be where i want to be but thank god i'm not can somebody give praise that we're not where we use to be it's called layover it's called halfway it's called the bible didn't say and and and uh come on somebody in john 10 10 that he came to give us life and life to the half there's a life to the full and what i have understood and what i'm understanding is we have a church body not this church but the church who has been consuming samples and when you consume what's in your hand it's only one cluster and you have eaten the seed that is supposed to be planted in the soil that god has ahead for you pastor what are you talking about you have to get free you have to be delivered you have to be healed why because there's a generation that's after you i like to say it this way to make us mad are y'all ready if you're not gonna get free for yourself why set your children up with halfway why set the generation that's coming up behind us with halfway so we have got never allow i'm telling you guys the fruit that's in your hand to stop you to settle for halfway yeah yeah ground grapes now i'm gonna preach these other two points giants somebody say giants now watch this so these twelve come back then they told moses and says we went to the land where you sent us it's amazing it flows with milk and honey and ah man and this fruit man these samples are amazing nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large moreover we saw the descendants of enoch there watch this the amalekites the hittites the jebusites come on somebody the amorites the canaanites the gossipites the fearful ice the betrayed ice the complainerites come on y'all that's us in other words what god showed me the giants are not external the giants are internal yeah and we've got giants that are on the inside of us they're called the giants of disappointment and now the heights of not trusting people anymore and the heights of fear and the heights of unforgiveness and the eyes of of of you know what this church is how about the heights of good enough you mean we got to have a building you mean you mean god you're requiring more from us the heights of pride for lights how about the awful lights everything's awful the catastrophizing ice come on everything's a catastrophe oh my god i don't know how we gonna do this we got more month than we got money my husband talking about my my wife this addiction is too hard this thing is shut up why because what we say is what we get because the power of life and death is in our tongue what you say is what you get it's not the enemy on the outside of you it's the enemy on the inside of you that has become a giant there's giants i started thinking about these giants and i thought about the famous story of david and goliath y'all know the story yeah y'all don't know that story let me read it to you first samuel 17 43-47 let me set up first here's david david is short david is handsome david is obedient david is faithful david is the eighth choice he's the eighth brother david ain't used to having the favor of his father dave is not used to come on somebody playing playstation with his brothers david is out protecting sheep david is by himself david is isolated david is insecure david is upset that he's been overlooked come on somebody but he's still obedient and guess what there was a war going on there was a war going on between the philistines and the nation of israel and they stood on on two mountains with a valley in between them and guess what they talked trash to one another now if you've ever been to a football game or basketball game old school come on there's been a field in the middle there's people on that side people on this side and they say we got spirit yes we do we got spirit how about you and the sabbath says we got spirit yes we do we got spirit how about you this side we got to be back and forth and guess what the team that was the loudest it caused an advantage for the people on the field are y'all with me and here's david his dad asked him to take a grilled cheese sandwich to the war because his brothers was hungry david was obedient he takes the grilled cheese sandwich to the war and he shows up and he hears goliath talking trash to the israelites he's a giant i think that your inner giants have been talking trash to you telling you and reminding you of your past does anybody ever pass in here huh come on raise your hand maybe i need to go to another church maybe all y'all perfect huh are y'all like me like if we put your past on the screens everybody would just run out of here come on somebody be like okay i just wanna make sure i'm not by myself has your past ever talk trash to you keeps you up late at night makes you not confident in worship makes you not want to use your gifts come on y'all i don't know about you but my past sometimes is talking trash it was talking trash to me when i stood up here today come on it talks trash to me i'm telling you right now uh when i lost that 150 pounds watch this y'all when i was so big i was 420 pounds i used to have to pay for two seats to fly so i would pay for two seats to fly true story i lost the weight but i was so used to paying for two seats pastor marcus was with me one time and i went up after i lost the weight i went up to the counter and i said excuse me i would like to get two seats because southwest has this thing that they got to give you the second seat for free uh-huh i ain't gonna tell y'all cause then you stay big you know what i'm saying you said get out of debt this is helping me as i ate this fried chicken leg marcus went to the counter before me and said y'all he don't need two seats i'm like bro i'm trying to get two seats guess what he said he's like you need to start seeing yourself like i see you do you know one time i went to the airport marcus wasn't with me i asked the two seats they wouldn't give it to me the manager of southwest came over and said sir i don't mean to invade your privacy but you don't need two seats but i was so use to being something else and do you know that i went home and didn't fly because i didn't see me like freedom saw me and my past was talking trash sometimes when i'm preaching you'll see me tugging on my shirt and my kids will say stop tugging on your shirt you're not pounds anymore i'm being transparent because i want to let you know sometimes your past just talks trash to you and it has become a giant so here we go the philistines said to david am i a dog that you come to me with this shepherd's staff all david has is a staff a pouch and a slingshot and the philistine cursed david's god the philistines said to david come to me and i will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts to the fields then david said to the philistines watch this you come at me with sword and spear and javelin but i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts watch this now the god of the armies of israel whom you have taunted can i prophesy to y'all for a second the enemy has taunted you for too long that's why we have this society that is dealing with this anxiety and these emotional issues i have them i'm dealing with them i'm telling my enemy let me tell you this way i'm sending the giants that are in my mind and my heart and my emotions and eviction notice come on somebody that says enough is enough giants guess what the presence of god is about to locate where you're about to vacate can i tell you right now just because there's a giant on the inside of you does not mean that the presence of god sees a sign that says no vacancy if there is no giant there is no glory it takes a giant for the glory of god to be made manifest and some of y'all sitting there like you don't have giants talking to you you know what the john that's talking to you if you can't praise god right now it's called the giant of shame you are scared for anybody to know what you've been through you are scared for anybody to know your testimony uh-huh i ain't clapping right here somebody might know something wrong all right shot them right here uh uh i'm gonna sit here and what you do is you sit there and you ruminate can i have a chair and you ruminate cause somebody in a chair right there and you sit there and you say a man and you're in the presence of god and you start feeling the presence of god and you don't want to get up doing worship and you don't want to raise your hands and you're sitting there and everybody's asking how you're doing and you're like blessed and highly favored but really you're frustrated and you're upset and you're sick and tired of being sick and tired but you some reason you came to church and some reason and some of you came in and you're suicidal and you're sitting there and you're saying god this is my last effort god if you don't move today i i don't know if i'm gonna be back tomorrow and god is sitting on the throne of heaven and he's looking at you and he's saying i'm sick and tired of them being sick and tired but if they don't move today i feel god right now could it be that god is asking for you to do something he's asking for you to put your hands together he's asking for you to get on your feet he's asking for you to worship him [Applause] if you don't move he won't move god inhabits the praises of his people [Music] sitting there broke sitting there confused about your identity your sexuality sitting there upset sitting there betrayed sitting there with unforgiveness sitting there resentful sitting there with diabetes come on somebody i'm here to tell you right now i have come to let you know that some of you don't

says that we overcome not by good worship services we don't overcome by altar calls we we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of a testimony everything that i said i used to still calls me

[Music] [Laughter] he's never lost the battle [Music] so here's goliath y'all can sit down i'm almost done here's goliath are y'all with me i have read this passage of scripture probably 2 000 times and never saw this before what i'm about to say goliath has a javelin goliath has a shield goliath has a sword goliath has a helmet goliath he has these shields he looks like a he looks like a catcher for baseball he has these shields over his over his shins his legs are covered his head is covered he's got brass knuckles on david said all i had in the wilderness was worship [Music] when the lion and the bear came to kill the sheep i had to make a weapon out of the environment that i was in all i could find was a stick the stick represents the word of god i i had to figure out have you ever had nothing and you had to erect a weapon and the only weapon you had was your voice the only weapon you had was saying great is not faithfulness the only weapon you had was the word of god the giant was big the word you were small but the word was bigger than the giant i'm telling you guys i have been in situations where i had nothing no friends nobody could call me all i had is we are standing yes on holy ground [Music] and i know that there were angels all around that's all i had that's all i had i have nothing let us pray i didn't have nothing devin i didn't have fancy i didn't have there was no band there wasn't a piano player there was no harmony it was just only thing i was there is what could i erect out of a hard place and that's worship i did a study guys listen to me for a second you need to get this then saul says david you're the only one that has stepped up to this giant take my armor y'all listen to this because you're gonna need it and i've paused and studied this time like for real said god i need to see some see something this and he said this he said tell the people that the reason that david didn't refuse saul's armor is not because saul was a double x and david was a medium it wasn't because saul was a medium and david was a small you ever try to put something on us too big for you it fits come on somebody but you can't put something on that's too small for you are y'all hearing what i'm saying although saul's armor was too big it was too small for this battle [Music] and i studied the customs of how the armies would send down their biggest baddest fighter come on y'all watch 300 and they would fight and that would determine the battle those battles they were fought with hand-to-hand combat so goliath was dressed to have close proximity with david and hand-to-hand combat but the reason david couldn't wear saul's armor because david never planned to get close some of you have been so used to fighting your battle close proximity you've been so used to battling in the midst of something and god says no i am going to change the location without changing the destination david says i am going to fight with a weapon that goliath has never seen the bear saw it come on somebody the lion saw it my daddy ain't even seen it i am telling you right now that public battles are watch this by private weapons paul says it this way that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty into the pulling down of strongholds let me tell you something mixed church you cannot break a stronghold with a strong effort you have to break a stronghold with a strong prayer life you have to break a stronghold with strong time in the presence of god i am telling you right now i'm prophesying to everybody in this church right now in 2022 you are gonna be further away from your enemy but further on the other side of your enemy i'm telling you right now you don't need to have hand-to-hand combat you don't need to throw hands you need to raise hands you don't need to throw hands you need to lay hands i feel right now there's a battle being won and you ain't even close to it if you take it in the spirit god says i'll make it happen in the supernatural if you want to slay a giant i want you to slay the glory of god in the presence of god this is how i fight my battlefield [Music] [Music] y'all staying with [Music] but i'm us
