[Music] and we're gonna jump into the word of god i want you to get out your notebooks here at the mix we say that note takers are what yeah world changer so i just want to let you know today you are a world changer and we're diving into week two of our series unapologetic and i feel like this is a part two of what we've extended on last week as we were talking and i just believe that god has a word in the house and so we're gonna read from matthew chapter 14 starting at verse 26 to 33. and we're going to continue in the story that we were on last week because jesus has just fit the 5 000 the bible lets us know that it's not only just 5 000 it's only 5 000 men but now it's added men and women and children so it's about we're talking 10 000 possibly all the way up to 15 000 that the lord has ministered to and not just only ministered to the spiritual need but he's also ministered to the physical need and the bible says he takes two fish and five loaves of bread now i'm trying to tell you two fish don't if you've ever had a fish fry fish don't divide that well in the bread they don't make a good fish sub that well you got to have a more fish than you have bread but tell somebody jesus can do anything come on i'm trying to tell you he deboned that thing you understand what i'm saying he put that thing on a roll and he fed the 5 000 plus women and children and it was the best fish sub i don't care if you go to stokos i don't care if you go to mamma mias whatever is the spot around yahweh i'm trying to tell you you ain't had a fish sandwich till you met jesus amen he's got this fish sandwich and he gives it to the disciples and they distribute it to those that are groups of 50 and 100 and the bible says that after they have done all of this work that jesus dismisses the disciples and he dismisses the crowd and the disciples get into the boat and they head out into the water where some of them were never uh afraid of they're never unfamiliar with their fishermen that became fishers of men but the bible says jesus goes into the mountain and he is praying and it lets us know about the fourth hour when you go back through verses 22 through 25 it says that jesus does something that's a little bit different can i can i can jesus didn't have an uber jesus didn't have a speedboat jesus didn't have a yacht jesus said i've got what i've got and that's my two legs and so he said i don't have to split water because i walk on water i just want to let you know the kind of god that you serve he he doesn't have to move things he is the very god of things and and so he walks on the water and the bible says we get to this point where he is meeting up with the disciples and the disciples are in the boat and says but when the disciples saw him coming walking on the sea they were the bible says terrified didn't even say just scared it said they were terrified and said it is a ghost and they cried out in fear i just want to let you know these were all young men tough fishermen tax collectors men who who who had some work value to them but can i even tell you that the bible lets us know that even men get scared it lets us know it doesn't matter how tough you are it doesn't matter how how much put together you are that all of us get scared sometimes it says they cried out in fear but immediately jesus spoke to them saying take heart i'm here today to let somebody know no matter where you are in this moment the lord is speaking take heart he said it is i do not be afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it is you because sometimes i want to let you know the enemy is trying to implicate the voice of god he's trying to make it as if he's speaking anybody ever been there before you're asking god lord what are you saying to me and you hear a voice like just go ahead and do it you're like this don't this don't sound right just don't this don't feel right this somebody somebody's is trying to emulate something else that they they have i'm trying to let you know the enemy will act like that he's speaking from god but i'm here today to let you know that when the lord speaks you can hear him clearly the bible says that that peter said lord if it is you command me not see sometimes i need a command from god i don't need god to be suggestive i need to give god permission to move me out of my what complacent or comfortable state and what command my situation to come on to the water and he said come so peter got out of the boat walked on the water and came to jesus but the bible says when he when he saw the wind the one was there all the time it lets us know at the beginning that they were already scared they were already understanding that they were in a windstorm but it says when he saw the wind here's my problem you cannot see the wind and there was something about the set of circumstances that peter was in that made him fearful i tend to think it wasn't just the winner but it was the condition and the violence of what he was feeling from the wind he didn't see the winner but he felt it and the enemy is here trying to be like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and some of us are scared of not what we see but what we feel says peter saw the wind says as he ceases when he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me it doesn't matter what you're in it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter how far you've gotten out there i just want to let you know anytime you can call on the name of the lord the bible says the lord saved them and jesus immediately somebody say immediately if you call on the lord he'll immediately reach out if you call on the lord he'll immediately step into your set of circumstances if you call on the name of the lord he'll immediately grab you out of that broken place if you call on the name of the lord he'll take you out of that temptation sometimes in the midst of when you don't know what to do and all your emotions and feelings are stirred up sometimes you just need to call on the name of jesus you need to yell out jesus save me i can't help myself in this moment i don't have enough strength to overcome this temptation i don't have enough strength to overcome this moment i don't have enough shift to overcome this brokenness sometimes you just got to yell out jesus save me right now where i am i don't know if i'm in my right state of mind but i need jesus to do what save me i don't care who hears me but i'll yell it out jesus save me jesus save me the bible says immediately immediately he reached down his hand and took hold of him saying to him oh you [Music] of little faith why did you doubt [Music] the bible says when they got into the boat when ceased sometimes the circumstance you're in won't calm down until you step out in faith and trust god i'm holding that spot right there this is when the wind sees that i don't know if you were in baltimore in the surrounding area yesterday when when the snowstorm was going and it started snowing at one moment it looked like it was dying down and then the next moment it looked like all of us were going to be like the wizard of oz and we were going to go somewhere [Music] the storm had to get through its cycle some of us are praying for god to end the storm too early and if he ends the storm too early you don't get to learn the lesson that he's trying to teach you so you've got to let the storm pass every time the storm doesn't need to end sometimes the storm needs to pass so that you can learn what you're supposed to learn in the condition of what the storm brings sometimes if i can tell somebody today the storm is your catalyst the storm is everything you need to toughen you back up and give you the resilience you need to know that the lord is on your side i don't know who i'm talking to today but you've been praying about the storm all you need to do is say lord don't end the storm just keep me through the storm because the storm is the catalyst for your next season of what you've been asking god to do i'm just believing that the storm has to go its cycle and the bible says at the end of the storm at the end of people seeing you work through what you thought would kill you at the end of people seeing you walk out something they have never seen before to forgive the unforgivable to do the unbelievable to move and operate in the unexpected and operating in the exceeding and the abundantly and above all when people see you not run away from the storm not crouch down to the storm not beg the soul but you stand firm in the storm the bible says when people see it it says and this is what happened when they got back in the boat they worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god i want to let you know today you're still in the storm because people need to see you overcome sometimes you're in the storm because people need to see you break through they can't see god so they need to see you sometimes you're right in the middle you're saying god take me out but if he takes you out too early you don't get to get the audience for people to say my god he must be the son of god if he changed your life he must be the son of god if he changed your circumstances he must be god if he brought you out if he broke the addiction if he healed your body he must be the son of god so i want to preach from the topic today sometimes you got to step out to step in you got to step out of where you are to step into what god has for you to do and we're going to talk about that this morning can we pray father in the name of jesus help us to step out to step in amen god bless you thank you so much musicians i appreciate it y'all can y'all help me give it up for our dream team that's in the house today serving big time that's what's up tell your neighbor step out just step in tell your second choice step out to step in tell your third choice say i'm sorry in my third choice but step out to step in step out to step in i'm just believing that's for somebody today god is calling for you to step out to step into the right set of circumstances to step into the right place at the right moment that god has been orchestrating even before the foundation of the world the lord has called for you to step into your right zone anybody know you just got a zone it's a place where you get into where you're not worrying about what everybody else is doing where you don't care what everybody else is saying when you don't worry about how much they got what they just bought but you in your zone it's a place where you step out and say i'm willing to trust god with everything for everything in everything because he is head of my life i'm looking to jesus the bible says who is the author and the finisher of my faith it's time to step out to step in i'm telling you this today because oftentimes it can be fearful to step out i don't know if you know like me but i i was one of those late people who learned how to swim anybody you you learn in your adult age to learn how to swim i'm one of those people that stepped out and said you know i'm going to try out swimming and and and if i can tell you today you know if you've got a child get that child into swimming early because there is nothing like a grown adult myself going to speak straight on me trying to get into the water shaking telling the lord if you could help me walk on it better than i can swim in it i'll take that as well and i'm telling you that today because i i'll never forget i i spent some money i went to the ymca and i wanted them to teach me how but there is something about when you're called to step out that it's fearful because you feel that when you step out you don't have any support around you i went i i went swimming and and they tell you to get in the water and and i'm and the first thing i'm doing is i'm reading my surrounding you got to read your surrounding because i got to know how deep this water is anybody know you're looking at the side of the gauge i'm not i'm not moving until i find out the footage in this water i get in it starts at about three feet i feel good four feet my faith starts to waver five feet i know that the lord is no longer with me the bible says his rod and staff they comfort but it was not comforting me at that moment i step out into the water and i try to swim and they tell you all right here's what you're about to do you're about to leap out and kick your feet the problem is is that my brain doesn't have the ability to operate at the same time while keeping myself from drowning and making the decision to kick my feet because in my head my feet need to be on the ground so what you're telling me doesn't seem like it makes sense but the only way you can swim is if your feet are off the ground now you have the fakers you seen them they tall enough to be in the pool they doing this and you under the water like hey man you walking you know you're not swimming talking about did i get anywhere no no you didn't there's something about when you're learning something new that you have to trust in the process and you have to trust in the process that even though you're fearful it's going to lead you to an outcome that you desire if i can pull my feet from off the ground and learn to swim and kick enough then you know what i may can get somewhere well i went through the lessons at the ymca problem is is there was no test at the end to determine if what i had learned could actually be put to this moment well i went to florida with the family and we quick learned that whatever i thought i learned had not been applied as well as it should have been when i went to make that leap and three feet i thought i was going to lose it all my wife yelled on the side just stand up you won't drown can i tell y'all we will lose our very inclination of how to do the normal things when fear strikes when fear gets in our heart we get paralyzed we we forget the understanding and the clarity of what we should do and and we act instead of uh and thinking about what we have the ability to do we're way more what reactive than we are what proactive and i'll never forget i got down there my wife tried to teach me swimming i think that's where we got a fragment of brokenness in our relationship because for some reason i did not trust her just like i didn't trust the people at the y but what i know is you have to be determined enough and to have the carriage that what carriage is it's doing it in spite of and so i kept getting up in the morning and there was this couple and the couple is sitting on the side and the lady says hey are you are you what's going on i said i'm trying to learn how to swim i tried to leave my wife and children so that i could have a surprise for them like when they woke up like i learned y'all it was either i learned or they didn't hear from me it was going to be one of the two and i said to i said it's like you know i'm just trying to learn and my wife comes out and we're by the pool and the hotel and she said well won't you just try this way she said won't you just try to dive in underneath and swim i said so you want me to be totally immersed in this water the craziest part about it is is i did this dive in and started swimming and i started swimming and i was under water and y'all you know how you get too happy about your blessing y'all i was so happy i was swimming my life away i mean i'm swimming back and forth my wife is celebrating i am excited i am swimming my life away the problem is is that i'm underwater my eyes are open and i have no goggles and we are at the public pool well what you know is that there's something called chlorine i thought it was chlorine it felt like bleach like somebody just went in and said here we go that should be clean when i got out of the pool it was hazy when i kept walking i went blind i couldn't see y'all i went to dinner and and and it's messed up that your own people will laugh at you i say anybody want me to drive everybody said no no no we're good thank you i go and i'm trying to order food and i can't see because because i i my eyes are glazed over i think people are feeding me peppers and stuff like i just can't see and the problem oftentimes is because we're so scared of what will be the outcome of our lives that we never step out to step into something different here's the thing i got over the fogginess but yet i learned how to swim here's the thing that we're worried too much about is what will happen if i do and we don't understand that the result of the uncomfortableness will go away it's a part of the process but some of us aren't stepping out in faith because we're so fearful of what will take place that we never get to experience what god calls exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think peter in this moment has realized that he is with the true and living god but the lord the bible says at the fourth hour of the night comes walking on the water now i'm not gonna lie to you if i'm out in the middle of the ocean and there is a storm happening and there is a body that starts walking to me i promise you i'm thinking about how we about to fight that's what's coming into our mind do you see that i see that do you see that i see that i can see the disciples saying am i i promise you bro with tears coming down their eyes whatever it is we gonna tear this thing up jesus comes in and says hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa it's me because what fear does it will make you miss and that you cannot see when god is in the midst the bible says the lord is there and he walks up to me and says do not be afraid because fear is the first thing that grips us and when fear grips us it keeps us from moving in faith the bible lets us know that jesus tells him he says listen listen listen it's just me calm down chill out it's okay i want to go off our first point today our first thought in our series unapologetic is that you need to be able to expect the unexpected so many times some of us operate in the place of so much consistency that we're never looking for things to change we're always looking for things to be the same the same way i operate the same way i do now there is nothing wrong with consistency but there's something wrong with consistency without a vision you can be consistent just make sure there's a goal or a vision at the end of your consistency because consistency for consistency's sake doesn't bring about a result to anything you gotta expect the unexpected can i can i tell you today you have to be able to expect the unexpected that's why every day with jesus is so important because the bible says i want what daily bread i want god to give me what understanding and clarity i want god to give me revelation for what the day because the day changes so that means the word of what god wants to speak in the day will change with the day some of us we operate as if we were 10 years ago in the today's present and you're trying to act like well that's not how we did it last year the problem is is last year is not this year that's why they called it last year and you're trying to do what you did last year in this year the year changed but we didn't change some of us even now as as as we're coming to different season in this pandemic everybody's like man i just wanted things to get back to normal the problem is as normal as yesterday why do you want yesterday's blessings if tomorrow's blessings are greater that's the thing we think normal means i don't have to operate in faith i don't have to move any further than where i am i don't really have to extend myself but the truth of the matter is is that you need to be able to be shaken by what god is doing so that you can believe god for what's happening tomorrow not believing god for what happened yesterday because if you're believing god for what happened yesterday the problem is yesterday already happened so you don't need faithful for what god already did you need faith for what god is about to do you got to expect the unexpected you got to expect what's not about to happen you got to expect god to do the things that you've never seen before you've got to expect god to move in ways you've never expected him he moved before that's why your prayer life would be so dynamic is because you would be expecting god to answer prayers for things you haven't seen yet what are you expecting god to do in this moment in this year at this time that you haven't seen god do before you're like i just wanted to keep me he kept you yesterday he's pretty good at that he's proven himself he can keep you what else can i explain real quick why some of us don't have expectation it's because the lord has already done enough to meet the level of where we never thought we would get to that we never dreamed or envisioned anything greater than where we are today and we haven't given ourselves permission to might say permission you haven't given yourself permission to go any further to envision any greater to see any greater than where you are because you're still stuck getting over that god got you out of the last thing and if you could see that god could do greater you would envision for greater because every greater is not dependent on the need the greater is dependent on what you can ask for if you can't ask for it you can't receive the bible says ask and you shall what receive seek and ye shall what find knock and what the door shall be open some of us are giving god our expectations in a context of acting like god should know god says i know but the problem is is you didn't activate my word and my word says you have to ask in order to what receive other than that we don't do any work in the process of asking which is an object of helping us to believe by faith and what god would do we're just expecting god to do anybody ever went up to a door ring or you've seen somebody at a ring and they don't knock on the door or ring the ring they just stand there expecting you to answer the door and they staring to the ring like i know you see me i know you see me right here come answer the door and you're like why didn't you what ring the doorbell because we think because we're in front or we're in god's presence that god has to answer because i'm what visible but the bible says no if you look according to his word he says when you ask it you shall receive it we're just standing in prayer like this i know you see me i know you see all that i'm going through he said i don't need you to identify the problem i need you to speak to the problem you got to speak to that problem lord i see what is happening in this moment i need for you to do greater here's the thing god isn't always only solving problem but god is doing more than meeting needs god is in the blessing business some of us are only praying about a need here's the thing you don't understand that god has delivered you out of the season of that need so you stop praying but the problem is is you need to be praying so that god can do greater so i pray for the for the job and the lord gave me the job and i'm just grateful no no lord you got me in this door all right so how many more promotions do i have you know somebody around you well you don't need a promotion just thank god for what you got god didn't call me to be satisfied he said i could be content until he does the next thing but he didn't tell for me to be satisfied because he already why can't you be satisfied because he already said i would do greater things so why would i be satisfied when god has already given me greater somebody can catch that oh somebody didn't catch that because your expectation is the only way that god can work is if i am in need here's the thing i'm always in need for more lord give me a job there you go go give me a promotion there you go lord i want to own the company there you go god help me to make another location there you go god's like i you keep asking i'll keep giving but some of us have stopped asking because we've gone further than we thought we would so we're saying just be grateful and god's saying you're losing out on everything i already have in store for you that will be done on earth as it's already declared what in heaven lord what do you have in store for me in heaven that i have not seen manifested on earth because whatever it is i need to see every drip of it when i see him in heaven i don't want to see no reserves no extras nothing that was in the corner for me i need everything that god has for me i want to expect the unexpected i walk and they said it's free i knew it was free i just didn't know when it was going to be free why because i was expecting god to do what the unexpected i don't know when he's going to do it but i'm expecting him to do it scripture lets us know in isaiah 55 and 8 it says as the lord says my thoughts and my ways are not like yours why because some of your thoughts and ways are broken and if my thoughts and waves are like your thoughts and ways then i would only bless you when you do good and i would always curse you when you did bad and i would leave out what my faithfulness and my love and my forgiveness and my kindness and my grace you would never see the extent of who i am why because you would think my ways are your ways and god says i'll bless you when you don't deserve it i'll heal you when you don't deserve it i'll keep you when you don't deserve it i'll pull you out when you don't deserve it why because you just called on the name of the lord jesus thou son of david have mercy on me you gotta expect the unexpected point number two is you gotta challenge the moment some of you are afraid to challenge jesus i'm not scared i put him to the test what can you do you say you can do exceedingly what can what what have you ever asked god what can you do we easily will say god can do anything you don't pray like god can do anything what could god do in your life that you never could imagine him doing for you if you believed it you would pray it and you would challenge the moment that you're in but because we don't oftentimes believe it we don't challenge it because we think it's against reverencing god god's like i have more than you can imagine or think and you're worrying about challenging me i was watching yesterday uh a youtube and there's a gentleman on there he was showing the house and the house 18 000 square feet seven bedrooms 13 baths i looked at it i said my lord let me tell you what the first mind that is captured in a moment may say you know that's a little excessive about everything that's a little much you know why we say things like that because we haven't seen things like that and so we put lids on the things that we haven't seen nor understand if god wants to bless me with the seven bedroom 13 bath at 18 000 square feet what i'm not going to do is tell god that's a little excessive lord i must say the mixed church has moved to my seven bedroom thirteen bath and we gonna worship god on the deck together god bless everybody that's where we'll be holding growth track at west grove track pm's house when all of y'all there and it's got 13 bathrooms you won't think it's excessive then you know why sometimes things are excessive because of who you're in the boat with tamon you you can't share everything you want to do because there's some people in the boat who don't see it the way you see it there's there's there's 11 other people in the boat who can't imagine that that's just way that's the successive that's just too much god couldn't do that with all that i've done and all that i've gone through it and and they can't see it but there is something that god has laid on your heart that is greater than what you ever want to share with anybody because it seems eccentric and god is saying today don't you worry about what everybody else thinks what am i telling you we're worried about everybody else in the boat you know how the boat is you think i should ask the lord will you like real quick you think he just you know you need to stop consulting with people about visions that they haven't even seen i think it's greater than what i've ever seen that thing is greater than than what what we've done together that thing is greater than what we've ever gone out to that thing is greater how much we gonna man we go in here and we're going to get this and we go and we're going to stay there and you're like nah that's a little bit too much i just think that's excessive it's excessive because you haven't seen it and you haven't been open to something greater than where you are i'll never forget y'all i'm going to talk about this for real for real i'll never forget buying my first like 200 pair of shoes and i'll never forget that because when you come out of a state you tend to think that your state is the state of where everyone else should be and anybody over your state doesn't really understand what it is to be humble and gracious and and so we live out i'll never forget i was buying a pair of shoes and i was in uh uh uh the saxon and arundel mills and and it's like the outlet and i looked at these pair of shoes and charles i looked at them and they were 200 and my wife said you should get them i said you have lost your mind aldo's is right around the corner and they got some shoes for 51.99 you know how much i'm saving now this is this is not to anybody without those shoes because i wore but god had changed god had changed where peter was a fisher men to a fisher of men where he picked him up where he didn't really believe in and where he really didn't understand the clarity is different than the peter that was now that had just seen the 5 000 plus just be fed in and had his hand in it it's a different season so you do not speak against people for the season that they're in but when you've changed your season stop apologizing for the season you're in i was like oh these shoes are and my wife was like here's what you have to understand if you buy these pair of shoes you're not going to have to buy two and three more pairs of the shoes that you normally get because all you're going to have to do is put the taps on the back of them so it doesn't wear off the heel and these shoes will last longer than you getting a different pair of shoes every time something comes up because they got worn out or they got scratched and you know about that aldo scratch once it's in there it ain't coming out buddy okay how much shoe polish you got you just have one shiny side of the shoe and i remember saying her no no no no and she said you gotta understand we're not talking about more for the sake of more we're talking about more for the sake of impact you can get more from this than just staying where you were some of you are scared to move into the next step of what god has called for you to do because you're scared that people are going to see you a different way because of the increase in favor of what god has done but they don't understand the level of faith that you had to operate out of it when you did not have sex money and you had a bogo kind of lifestyle nobody saw that so don't stay where you are to please people's minds emotions and thoughts you've got to leave the 11 behind and say sometimes to yourself lord if issue bit me to come if that's my house you tell me and i'll give them keys because i don't have time to listen to where people who have not been yet tell me where to get to some of us are operating that we're not believing god for the healing in our life because we've only seen god do just enough for someone else and you're like pastor i'm with cancer and and i'm down i'm like you need to pray that thing through then well uh god doesn't do that level god does every level it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter what stage you're in it doesn't matter what's happening god can make it dry up in the middle of the minute bible says immediately god can do things immediately if you have the faith to believe challenge the moment when jacob was with the lord the angel of the lord the bible says in genesis 32 26 then he said let me go this is the angel let me go for the day has broken if you want it bad enough you'll hold on like you dear life the bible says but jacob said i will not let you go unless you bless me how long you been in prayer until i get something from the lord who are you yelling out it's the lord you're like what are y'all doing wrestling you look crazy i look crazy but i got crazy faith and i'm willing to wrestle god through this prayer until he's willing to give me an answer because i need god to go beyond what i just feel naturally i need to be able to step out so that i can step into a new place that god has called for me to be because unlike you i'm just saying this to myself i don't like being and staying where i already am i need to see greater point number three don't reject your request don't don't self sabotage because it's greater than what you've ever seen and realized in your life some of us will find ourselves to talk we'll talk ourselves out of our own blessings but you know this probably isn't for me because you know [Music] you know i haven't been the greatest christian you know this this probably isn't for me because you know you know that stuff that i did before and i messed up [Music] you forgot where he said his brand new mercies every morning greatest thy faithfulness oh lord [Music] so far as the east is from the west that's how far you've removed our sin lord could you be using me today could could you be using me today to do what i think i would never do [Music] some of us are so frustrated with our healing that we go back into our broken states because we thought it was too fast [Music] no i just need i need a little bit more time for god god said no no i already healed you [Music] but if you want to keep picking the womb to feel good about where you are you can do that but i want to speak over someone's life today that the bible is letting you know you're healed you're not waiting for healing you're not waiting for a mindset change it's changing [Music] you're in process of what god is calling for you to do but you have to step out to step in my question today is what do you need to step out of so that you can step into what god has for you [Music] we got to step out you know to step out [Music] you know to step out of a boat onto water means you have to step out from a higher ground into a lower space so many of us believe that stepping out is only about stepping up [Music] but some of you don't know it's stepping into something that looks lower but it's something that's never been done before but why would i go into that position god's like if you go into that position it leads to a position that no one else has you're like but i'm not gonna go lower i'm not i'm not gonna sacrifice what i'm doing to see what could be no no no no no you're stepping out to step in i've gotta step out of the boat and step into the water which is moving and it's rough well how long did they say the position was they said they're not even sure how long they're going to keep me but i hear god saying step out [Music] i'm not sure how long this is going to work it i'm not sure how long we can continue this way but some of you are hearing god say step out some of you are in the season and god has placed you at the right place but your mind is getting in the way of what you think and the lord is saying step out you say i have no possibility i can step out you don't know my bills you don't understand what i got to do and the lord says i'll do greater than you could ever imagine or think i just need for you to step out some of us will never experience the level of what god wants to do because we're too scared to step out stepping out looks like stepping down we're stepping down and stepping into a place that no one else has been before not one of those disciples will ever be able to say that they walked on water [Music] what if i fail what if you do is he not able to keep you from falling [Music] is he not able to present you faultless my question that jesus asked today is why do you doubt lord i i doubt because of how much i've obtained i doubt because of i don't want to lose what i have i doubt because i've worked so hard to get to where i am that i can't imagine life without it and the lord says the life that you're imagining is not even the life i have for you i have somebody say greater can you just tell your neighbor real quick just just tap them say god's got greater [Music] can you look at your second choice because they need a little bit more they need somebody else to talk to them they need two or three to gather together and touch and agree can you look at your second choice and say god's got greater can you just find one more person that's going to be your third choice and say i'm sorry you're my third choice but i need to tell you god's got greater now if you believe that give god a praise in this place that he's got greater for you come on anybody in expectation that god has got greater anybody believe he can do more than you can imagine or think anybody got a praise that was unexpected i didn't come here believing today was going to change but i have an unexpected expectation that when i get home god's changing my situation when i get to work god's changing my situation i'm expecting the unexpected i'm expecting the unexpected i'm stepping out to step in i'm stepping out to step in i don't know what tomorrow holds but i'm stepping out to step in i'm stepping into a new crown i'm stepping into a new place uh god you're gonna do more than i can imagine a finger greater is he that's operating in me than he that is in the world i'm not worried about a boss i'm not worrying about the devil i'm not worrying about the doctor i'm not worrying about the lawyer it's all about what god says if he says come then i will come i'm stepping out to step in i'm stepping out to step in i'm excited about what god has for me i'm excited about what god has in store for you i'm excited about the next level of where god is taking you i'm excited about the next financial bracket you're walking into i'm excited about the next door that god is opening i'm excited about the next position that you're going to walk in and sit and i'm excited for what god is going to do in your marriage i'm excited about what god is going to do in your life i'm excited about the business that god is going to expand i'm excited why because i'm expecting the unexpected i'll step out to step in i'll step out to step in i'll step out from the 11 to step into god's blessings i'll step out to step into a miracle i'll do whatever it takes to see god manifest what he has in my life god can do in more than i could even imagine or think and i want to get that in somebody's head today you're doubting the set of circumstances that god can speak over and i want to tell you today god can do more than you could ever imagine a thing i'm saying miracles right now in my house miracles right now in my life miracles over my family miracles over my friends miracles over my church miracles over everything in my life why because he can do great things [Music] but you gotta step out to step in [Music] you can have your seat i'm ending [Music] i want to speak to some men in the house you asking me the question pastor how do i reclaim my life how to reclaim the leadership that god has spoken over my life i'ma tell you this it is not about staying in the safe zone it is about walking in the faith that god has placed in you as a man of god with dominion and a man of god operating who god's called for you to be you must be able to lead out of faith you cannot lead out of what you see but i'm speaking this today that god is calling for us to lead as leaders and leaders have to lead in faith for the bible lets us know the only way you can really truly please the lord is when you live out of the faith that god has placed on the inside of you because i don't want to get you twisted your faith is not of yourself but your faith is from the sea that god has already planted on the inside of you women of god i want to let you know today to be everything that god has called for you to be you cannot rest where you are and you cannot accept what everyone tells you you have to be in a place where you're willing to step out of the comfort zone to look crazy you gotta look crazy to step into a new place you gotta look crazy they're gonna talk about me yes they are that's what people do when they have not been where you are we talk about what we don't know because it's our way of comfort for the things we cannot explain you know that was just crazy that they just did that and they're gonna go ahead and try to you know and apply for that that is just too much i don't think it's too much [Music] because whatever you have vision for god can fulfill if you don't have vision for it god can't fulfill it god's going to use me to change a country if you have vision for it god can do it how you going to do it it's a certain amount of money i need what's the money you need you got to be able to envision it whatever you cannot envision you cannot expect to receive if you can't see a whole family guess what it's going to be hard for you to get a vision from god of how to put a whole family together if you can't see a healthy marriage i want to tell you today it's going to be hard for you to get an understanding and clarity of how to produce a healthy marriage why because you don't have vision for it the responsibility that god is calling for us to live through and live out is in this moment in presence and understanding lord whatever you have for me to do i am willing to do it now i believe this the more you step out is the more you'll see god's hand move it doesn't matter if you start drowning because as soon as you call on the name of the lord the bible says immediately he'll save you so there is a risk in your faith [Music] you're like i want no risk i'm like well then stay there because your salvation can be sealed but the problem is without faith it's impossible to please god so you're going to have to come back to a place of faith where you start trusting god for that which is not seen and i speak this over your life today i believe you could see god do incredible things if you would stop consulting with the eleven here's what i know is true yes is scary yes that's crazy yes i wouldn't do it everything they probably were saying and thinking was actually probably true real quick every person that gives you a reality check is not speaking lies that's right we love to create haters for the sake of our comfort because we have the idea that we can do everything you can do all things through christ so some things that people are saying are actually truths we don't like that no no because they they telling me wrong no they're telling you right but the problem is is that your faith has to overcome even that truth you remember when the 12 spies walked into canaan they weren't speaking lies they were speaking truths there's giants in the land they're the americas they're the amorites there was not they weren't telling lies they were speaking truths the enemy has spoken some truths it's going to be hard that money ain't gonna come as quick as you think if you make that you have to sacrifice some stuff and you like y'all just hating no no they tell them some truths the problem is though is having the faith to overcome what seems like a negative truth because we can have a truth that has been wrapped in negativity to keep us from fulfilling the call and purpose of what god is speaking know the difference you don't have to call them a hater you just got to recognize they don't understand the spin on what god is going to do yes it's going to cost me yes it's going to be uncomfortable yes i'm not gonna like where i'm going but guess what baby at the end of that thing once you see god work with me the way he works with me when i get back and i show y'all what he's done with me all y'all gonna say truly this is the son of god [Music] you'll get back and you'll say truly yeah it was uncomfortable yeah it did mess up some stuff yes we did have some arguments about it but we still trust in the lord and that's what i'm telling you today you got to trust in the lord and believe that he is able to do more than you could ever imagine or think today
