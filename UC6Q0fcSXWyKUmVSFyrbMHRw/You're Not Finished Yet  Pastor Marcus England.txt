[Music] it's real good to see you i'm glad to be in the house of the lord today and grateful for every individual that is a part of this moment we welcome you to the mix my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here at this church and i am so grateful that you made the decision to be with us on this special day today and i want to get into the word of god because i believe that god just has something he wants to tell us i think every week that we're coming god is just speaking life god is speaking newness into us he is he is speaking his spirit is allowing his presence to overflood our hearts and uh we're not just reacting but we're doing some changes in our life so that we don't just have an emotional response but that we we have a spiritual response that reacts to this moment and we say god we're gonna follow you we're gonna do whatever you say do we're gonna walk wherever you say go and we're so excited about that exodus chapter three exodus chapter three if you have your bible open it if you don't it's gonna be on the screen don't worry about it we got you we got you exodus chapter three we're gonna read verses one through twelve pastor that's a lot that's it don't worry about it we're gonna help get your devotions in the day so that you can uh anything you missed this week i got you exodus chapter three verse one it starts now moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law jeffrell the priest of midian and says and he let his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to horeb the mountain of god and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush it says he looked and behold the bush was burning yet it was not consumed and moses said i will turn aside to see this great sight while the bush is not burned when the lord saw that he turned aside to see it says the bible called to him out of the bush that's got to be a little crazy y'all and he said moses moses and the fact that moses replied to the bush said there was something going on with him as well and he said here i am then he said do not come near take your sandals off your feet for the place on which you are standing is holy ground and he said i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look at god then the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in egypt and have heard their cry because they're taskmasters i know their sufferings and i have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land and land flowing with milk and honey to the place of the canaanites the hittites the amorites the perizzites the hibbites and the jebusites this is where rap lyrics first started in the bible it says and now behold the cry of the people of israel has come to me and i have also seen the oppression with which the egyptians oppress them come come and i will send you to pharaoh that you may bring my people the children of israel out of egypt but moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the children of israel out of egypt and this is what he said to him and i i want to make sure you know this is what god is saying to you he says but i will be with you and this shall be the sign for you that i have sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you shall serve god on this mountain if you don't mind i i want to give you the topic today that we're going to speak from the topic is you not finish yet you're not finished yet you've not finished yet you won't even finish until your time is over this is not the end god has something for you today let's pray father in the name of jesus we thank you for this moment because we understand as the breath is in our bodies you have more for us to do i declare today god as we are participators of your word that we not only be hearers but actual doers of what you're speaking for us to do for we love you we honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen i'm believing god today that he will speak thank you so much musicians so appreciate you i love this opportunity in time because i get to just celebrate some amazing people who just have a big heart for god and a big heart for what god has called them to do and that's our volunteers here at the mix we call them the dream team can you help me celebrate those that serve here at the local church y'all are heroes i think what i like about them so much is that they made a decision that they weren't just going to be consumers they're going to be contributors and i believe that's what the local church is about you're not finished yet any anybody i i don't know if you just kind of feel that but during this season of life i don't know if you've gotten comfortable like i have i don't know if you found yourself in a place where where just this time that kovit has brought us to has has just put us in somewhat of an awkward position it's stilled us it's rested us it's it's put us into position but the problem is is that some of us it made us lose our passion for life it made us lose the idea of where we were going and what we were doing and and we just got to a place where in this year we were all about changing up things to bring us to a different level of comfort some of us had to change our jobs or jobs in the way in which we did live some of us had to make changes to our finances some of us had to change the way in which we operate with our family and friends some of us had a thanksgiving over zoom some of us had a virtual time with our families and and some of us had really had to uh literally zone in on our health because when things happen in life like covid it changes the way that we do life and life has been different can anybody can attest to that it's it's just been different y'all things are different the way we operate is different we thought we knew people were saying hi to folks that we think we know but we really can't tell who they are because they got a mask on anybody know about that you're just scared to say hello to somebody just you're looking at them and you're staring each other in the eyes it's getting uncomfortable now because that's all you don't have a face to look at it's just an eye moment you're staring people in the eye in the moment because you're saying i know you but i i it's changed i don't really see who you are i don't really know who you are and if i can just celebrate us today is that many of us have been in a position where we wanted to quit but if i can celebrate you that if you're here today it means that you decided not to quit if i can celebrate you today no matter how rough life may seem at the moment and no matter how much things may feel complicated and no matter how much you seem to have wish things could go back to where they used to i want to celebrate you today because you didn't quit i want to celebrate you because you didn't throw in the towel you didn't give up you could have given up you could have thrown in the towel you could have said i'm done i'm finished but you said i'm going to hang in there and i just want to tell you congratulations you're still in the fight you're still in the game and you have not lost your battle not yet and with god on your side you'll never lose the battles that are ahead of you i think today is so important that we really get to recognize that when things in life tend to get hard we tend to try to find out how we can make it if you want to be honest somebody say easier can we be honest i'm trying to figure out how do i make this space of life easier how do i figure out how to not be as complicated and life not to be as so much of as a struggle and when moments in life happen sometimes you feel like throwing in the towel can i tell y'all i i picked up a new sport yup you can tell how athletic i am you can see it i'll just pose for you for one second i just want to take this moment because i i want to tell you about this new sport this new thing that i picked up is it's golf y'all and i picked it up and i i figured to help everybody else out i'll take some lessons you know what i mean i won't get out there so i don't hit nobody in the head with a golf ball i i don't want to see nobody just see me flipping out i don't want anybody to see me losing it and so and so i i started taking some golf lessons in and and there's nothing like uh hitting a good ball in a good distance and and and the problem is is though is that all of my golf lessons have been virtual they've been in a a simulation in a room where there is the green and i'm looking at the golf course but there there's there's a difference between the the real golf course and the virtual golf course there's peace there's no wind i don't have to worry about trees nowhere it's a perfect layout it's a perfect layout because i love the the context and the idea is that i get to get there there's somebody that's teaching me i have no pressure behind me i have no pressure in front of me i just get to do me and so i decided to take what i'm learning and what i'm growing i said why don't i go out on the golf course why won't i try this because i'm pretty good virtually i'm pretty y'all i can tear that ball to shreds but anybody know like you you can give a good amen at church but when the devil hits you on monday it's a little bit different than what what what what pastor was talking about he said all i had to do was pray but the devil is he's still on my neck he all he had he said all i had to do was just speak confidence and it will happen and and that's oftentimes the translation of life is that we're in these practice sessions and we're in church and we're worshiping god and we're honoring him with everything and then life really hits and what we're trying to do is apply what we've heard to the moments that are happening i got up and and i got out there y'all i i i bought a a bag of teas and and and i was ready i had my golf clubs i was looking real professional i had my shoes on i got myself a golf cart because i didn't feel like walking because that's who i am and uh i made the decision to to to get in it i had a couple before me and then i there was nobody behind me i felt really really good i said we're gonna start this and i'm gonna get this game flowing in and and i got out there and and the winds and stuff started to hit and and and i was like well i got this and and they they teed off the couple in front of me and they went ahead and and i got up there and i teed and and i got my my stance and my position and i was feeling good about myself i said look at that look at that what they taught me i look like a professional where's my endorsements at where's my endorsements i got on there and all of a sudden there was a group behind me it's good when nobody else is looking at you but you haven't noticed when when you start declaring things over your life and start believing that where you're going to go and you start operating and saying you know maybe god can do this but you're by yourself and you feel good because nobody can judge you but it's something when you step out on faith and there's people watching it's folk looking at you saying what you say you was gonna do how much you said you was gonna make what did you say god was gonna do for you and and i felt positive but when i looked back i saw people looking now there was only five guys but it looked like it was a whole game in my spirit there was 20. in my reality there was only five and they didn't care anything about what i was doing except for me to hurry up and move so that they could tee off as well but what the enemy is real good at is that when you make a decision to apply that in which you've learned he's going to test the very thing that you're making a statement to believe about and so when i got there i was feeling good until i saw people looking at me i said they're judging me i don't like them because they're judging me all of them i know they're doing that i stood up and and i hit knocked the ball i looked i turned back hope y'all didn't see that because right now i'm in the trees i make a decision hey should i you know should i replay this ball so i do i didn't even give this on the first service i hit the second one that went no way i just acted like it never happened i kept walking and i went into the trees down in the bushes and i got back on the fairway and guess what and then i got on the green and i got me a good par four definitely just right in the hole i felt good i said look at me lessons are paying off you ever been there before you applied the word and the word worked and you said look at me i will tear satan up i wish he would play with me i am a king's kid until life serves you a moment that you weren't really prepared for i got up to hit off the second hole and and the people were still right behind me judging me even though i don't know that they were judging me they weren't that was just me i got up and i went into my bag and the tees that i had bought and the gloves that i had i left my bag open then they all fell out somewhere in the course you need t's to tee off no t's no tee off that's how it works i walk up and i make the decision what you gonna do i said to myself man i should just quit i should just go off this course don't nobody know me i can act like i have an emergency what hello hey no i gotta get out you know you talk loud when you faking i gotta get out of here it's an emergency because the idea is that you rather quit than face yourself in believing that what you're in you can make it through you rather you rather dip off to the side and say i'll come back to it i'll handle it i i don't want to really feel the embarrassment and so i had to say to myself i'm going to have to play this hole either i'm going to quit i'ma play this hole and you know what i had to do i had to go back in my bag and find a club that was still going to help me get to where i was going without tease oftentimes god is giving you a word and that word is sure but the problem is the way you thought you were going to be able to handle it it changes it changes the way you were going to do it it changes the landscape you thought you had the plan all perfectly laid out and there were things that came up the enemy is trying to frustrate you he's trying to take you off your focus he's trying to take you off where god called you to and you don't have any teas you don't have the money you thought you were going to have you don't have the plan you thought you don't have you don't have the loan that you thought you were going to get the class is harder than you thought it was going to be the marriage is harder than you thought it was going to be the children are more stressful than you thought it was going to be the finances aren't available like you thought they were going to be and you said i don't feel like walking this out the rest of the way i rather quit and go to something else easier i'm just here today to let you know don't you give up don't you throw in the towel because it's getting tough it's always going to get tough that's why the bible lets us know the enemy he comes around like a roaring lion seeing whom he may devour i'm here today to let you know he wants to get you off track but you can not quit because you've got a purpose to finish just tell your neighbor real quick you're not finished yet and neither am i so i'm going to continue my story and and and and and this is the point that we've got to get the clarity in is to be able to understand it's that god is always what he said in his word he's with you i go through the course i start actually hitting david somewhere on the fairway i actually start getting into the green i see my lessons working on my shoulders i'm looking like a torment i'm hitting i'm getting better by every swing and then every other swing i'm getting worse it's just going back and forth y'all because the idea is oftentimes is that once i become a christian everything becomes perfect in the way that i do life i can't have any issues i don't have any struggles i don't have any areas that come against me i'm not fighting against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places once i got god everything becomes perfect i want to let you know that's not how it works life hits and it becomes real and it tires you out and it steals your joy and it makes you think why am i continuing and you remember at the end of the day the lord is with me i want to tell you today that the lord is with you you may be frustrated in this moment but the lord is with you you may be thinking about quitting in this moment but the lord is with you i got to the end of the nine holes thank god it wasn't 18. i can tell you right now i wouldn't have made it can i can i tell some of you that you're praying for more holes than you can handle can can i speak to somebody today to to let you know that you're trying to play a golf game and you can't handle what god is even saying right now and you're praying for more things than you can actually be able to handle you you you really can't grasp behold you think because you heard a good word that the enemy is going to be light on you i'm here today to let you know you you got to you got to play nine holes before you can go and try to do 18. you got to process your way through you got to learn your way through it so i got the whole nine and i just said to myself thank you god that i finished and that i didn't quit some of you your testimony is gonna be this one thing i finished and i didn't quit how'd it go that we we're not keeping score don't worry about that that's not that's not important right now i just need to what finish and what not quit that's just some aware of us in life all of us want to be perfect all of us want to have straight a's all of us want to be at the highest of our profession all of us want to do the absolute excellence and best that we can absolutely do but i'm here to let somebody know every time it won't be like that so stop getting offended because god is operating in the worst times and worst moments in your life and you still know what he's there he's not there when it's just perfect he's there when it's imperfect he's there when you fumble he's there when you messed up he's there when you didn't get it all right he said when you said words you shouldn't have said he's there when you mess up your finances and didn't manage it right god's saying i will always be with you not just in the good night but in the times that are bad he is with us we find moses at this place in his life where he's run off to midian he's run away from egypt where he was born where he was raised and moses had some early childhood issues he was given away he was almost killed he was raised while his parents were still alive with another family he's got a he's got a messed up childhood can i tell you that your past is not an excuse for you not to fulfill your future can can i tell you that you don't get an out because things weren't perfect in the beginning can i tell you that you don't get to stay where you are just because it didn't look the way you wanted it to look when you started out in life can i tell you that some of us has to release the things that were of our past and get healing and closure so that we can move towards our future because our past is our excuse for why we stay where we are and don't move forward to the calling that god has called us to maybe your parents were not perfect maybe your childhood was empty and loss of love maybe there was abuse in it but here's what i want to let you know you're still not finished you're not finished you're not finished because there was trauma you're not finished because there was hurt the lord is letting you know today i am with you y'all know before covet god was with us doran kovitt god is with us after covet god is still going to be with us the bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever more i won't let you know that today because it's not what's happening in the world that determines who you are and the set of circumstances that you operate in it is that god has already spoken over your life even before you were even formed the bible lets us know in jeremiah 1 5 it says this i knew you before you were formed within your mother's womb this was before he was telling jeremiah he said before you were born i sanctified you and appointed you as my spokesman to the world what does that declare god has already determined your purpose it is your responsibility to find it out that's what you're called to do that's your part of the the equation that's the part that god is saying the more you seek me you'll find me what happens when i find god i find me because who i am is in who he is the bible says we are made in what his image and his likeness just tell somebody i'm bad yeah yeah you ain't heard that in a long time from michael jackson i know that's an old one but you gotta let somebody know i'm bad i am not just okay i am not just average i am just not enough i am bad i am everything god created me to be i am more than enough i am a conqueror i am the head and not to tell i am above and not beneath i am blessed in my going out and my coming in please don't mess with me even though i look rough right now it hasn't stopped the purpose that god has over my life i'm just here today to let you know i'm excited because you're not finished yet here's what i do believe is that as moses found himself going through so much trauma in his life he still had a burning bush moment that's what's a burning bush moment it's the moment where you come to hear what god is saying for your life and you make a decision whether you say yes or no god has called for something over your life god is speaking something over you and you need to find out are you in the space of a yes or are you in the space of a no stop being in the space of a maybe because maybe it's still a decision to not decide we oftentimes think maybe is like a a safe zone i can say in the middle and god even lets us know in his word he says either you be hot or cold but if you be lukewarm i spill you out of my mouth what he's saying is make a decision about where you're going can i give you that's what the first point is you got to make a decision you got to understand that you you have to call yourself to something because when you don't make a decision you confuse yourself when you don't decide you wake up and you're like whatcha gonna do i don't know why because i haven't decided why because i wasn't intentional about what was next you never may have noticed this but the reason you're choosing the same way is because you haven't decided what to choose so you choose what's available get that real quick the reason why you're repeating your bad choices is because you haven't made a decision on what choices you would accept and what choices you won't accept so when it's wide open guess what anything that comes in is a possibility because there's no standard to filter what you want and will do you think indecisiveness and maybes are a safe ground and it's actually the most dangerous ground for you to be on why because the bible lets us know the enemy is going around like a roaring lion looking for what people to devour when you said no to god he already knows you on your side he's like are you on my side i'm good but when you say yes to god he's trying to tempt you and destroy you but when you said maybe he knows that he hasn't won you and neither has god so his greatest attack is in your maybe zone and in your maybe zone where you're pondering you're not making decisions because you're afraid of the consequences let me use this word consequence is not a bad word consequence is the result of what happens when you do a certain action so the context that i want to get you in real quick is in your burning bush moment have you said yes or have you said no because your maybe is what's drowning you it's the maybe we we don't like people that's all out for one way or the other but the problem that i have with that is that at least i know where they are it's an issue when nobody can figure out where you stand because you're scared of what people will say but there's a decision that you have to make and god has a burning bush moment for you to like so do you love me or no you're like are you going to serve me yeah absolutely god all right give up everything and follow me will you say everything like can we define everything if we remember the story about the rich young ruler it was real easy he was like dude some of us are not bad people others of us we we need god's grace pretty often we're destructive people i'm gonna put myself on that side if it's like one of those if god hadn't gotten in my life it just wouldn't have been pretty for this world but on the other side because god has gotten in my life i'm so focused and i'm so determined see stop being scared of people who have passion in their life because it means they've decided to give themselves to something it's passionless people who have made the decision that they'll go wherever the wind takes them i like passionate people they in your face how you doing you know you come in some of y'all came into the church and you were nervous you know i want to come into a church it's nice and low they're not saying too much but they're not not saying anything to me they they they're all right they're cool and collective they look like y'all we love that you know like let's just let me take my time easing in i if i was a greeter that's why i'm not and that's why when you take growth track uh step two today and they assess it that's why i got assessed i'm not hospitality because you might walk in and i'm like do you know jesus you'd be like wait wait what i i just walked in the door do you know him you don't know jesus you could go to hell you know that okay no i'm out of this church i'm gone i'm not doing this you're not gonna threaten me like you need some people that are just intense why because you know where they stand some of us are so wishy-washy that you don't know where you stand and people are just like invite them why they'll go for anything get them why they just want to be a part it's something when people know that you are so committed that you do listen you need to start thanking god for invitations you didn't get because people knew you had already decided when you get every invitation everywhere that means somebody don't know in the world where you stand are you a christian non-christian [Music] you believe in all the faiths like what what where are you at like i'm okay nowhere i'm at nowhere i stand he wanted them christians absolutely he want them jesus bumpers i like being a jesus bumper i like loving god and being here here's the reason why because you can actually trust what's coming out of me because maybe people we don't know what side you're leaning to so we can't trust your output because your output isn't to one space or the other it's open to whatever's available i'm just i'm just interested i'm i'm just interested in the context of have you made a decision this actually may be okay have you made a decision you see how i put that pressure on you you see that you see how we put that pressure on them just like real close like have you made a decision like back up and i'm not coming here no more this church is rough it's church like what else were we supposed to be you would be crazy if i got up on the stage like those of you that love jesus celebrate if you don't love them that's fine you'll be like this church is a little weird i don't think i don't think they know where they stand at at least you know when we come in i love jesus well we got him we know where he's at the question is have you made a decision can i tell you as a church we've made a decision that we're going to continue to go after lost people we're going to continue to see that god has potential in every individual and every human that comes no matter their mistakes no matter their past no matter where they come from no matter how they look no matter how broken they are no matter the things that come along with them i'm gonna tell you if you got no kids we love you if you got 10 000 of them we love you it don't matter i'll never forget i can i can give you all this story when when my wife was coming to church she had three kids and we were dating and i'll never forget coming in church and people was looking like who that i was like that's my girlfriend not the we not dating dayton we just dating are we together but not together together because in what i've learned from singles is that it's got to have two behind it in order for it to really mean something we talking but we not talking talking i said what in the world is that two words define it one doesn't we talking but we not talking talking i said well what does that mean well like we talking i said you don't even know what that means you use the same word in the definition that's against english define it for me well we talking well what does that mean like you know when you be talking it's like what is this it's got to have doubles behind it so i'm asking like are y'all talking to y'all like talking talking and they'd be like no we just talking so i mean something like so you dating other people no no no we exclusive but we not serious oh my god i'm out i was just like oh what does this mean and that's where we have come to is that we've given validation to the middle so we don't have to make a call i can do what i like yet not lose what i want because we talking but we ain't talking talking i'll get it i get it i get it i want to put all my eggs in one basket if i was a man i'd be getting offended that you're just talking to me but you still surveying the land as if i'm not enough we're gonna have a problem i'm talking talking and you just talking i got a problem either you talk talk or we just talk but there ain't gonna be no talk all right let's get off of that let's make a decision i was a relationship course real quick just make a decision take it back to my old time we go together or we don't that's it i just want to say this if y'all just talking fellas y'all in the friend zone all right i'ma leave that alone though i'ma leave that alone i'ma leave it alone [Music] i'ma leave it alone i'm gonna leave it alone all right i'm sorry i'm sorry i just you good but you ain't like great you're not gonna disrespect me like that i'm gonna find somebody else that want to talk talk shoot i'm flipping pages and i'm on my page point number two point number two we believe church should be enjoyed not endured y'all so i i teach that often point number two is that you have to get on course you have to get on course why is this so important that you are to get on course it's because oftentimes we're in position but we're not on course i'm a christian but i'm not following you get me like i'm saved but i'm not fully following jesus had a problem with that y'all the bible says that one day he was telling his disciples he said listen i need you to eat my flesh and drink my blood if not you have no part of the son of man and for those that really knew him they knew that jesus couldn't have been talking about a state of cannibalism they they knew that he was talking about a follow and the follow behind it what he was saying was whatever i'm calling for you to do i need you to be so open to trusting me that you'll do it and he didn't even give an example he didn't say let me explain this to you they didn't go on the back like the incident where there was a lack of faith for not being able to heal the demon-possessed boy and then going back and talk about jesus why couldn't we didn't he didn't have if they didn't go back and say so when you say flesh and blood like what do you really mean no he made a statement i'm here today to ask you in this moment as you're getting on course and jesus has declared what he is asking for you to do do you only get on course once you know where the finish line is or are you willing to get on course and learn where the finish line is when he gets you there too many times we're only willing to follow and to go as long as we have everything that satisfies us and guess what i'm here today to let you know some of our callings are on the line because we're not willing to follow god and not know where he's taking us i'm gonna tell you some of you today yeah you're supposed to be a business owner the problem is is that you're not willing to step out there on your own and allow god to take you in direction so guess what you settle for where you are and god can't take you any further to where you need to be and you're settling outside of your purpose and your call god's calling for you to do that god's calling you to be a mentor god's calling for you to develop an idea that will go global but the problem is is that he can't shore up your future by you knowing it without a yes so you need to make a decision and get on course and sometimes can i be honest you're going to ask where is this taking me and guess what you're going to hear silence where we going jesus where we going are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet and you won't hear anything anybody knows if you if you're a really really good parent you know not to answer back too quickly because the back and forth will easily irritate you are we there yet no are we there yet no are we there yet about the third one it's not only your voice that's elevated but it's your hand that's searching for a body are we there yet did not tell you why you driving endangering all of our lives because you got fed up sometimes god's silence so that you could just be patient and wait on him he's wondering will you follow me if you don't know exactly where you're going here's the thing wherever you're going you know i'm going to bless you abundantly but are willing are you willing to trust me along the way god has put you in some uncomfortable positions places states and you're trying to figure out how in the world am i going to navigate this and god said i'm not looking for you to figure out how to navigate anything i'm looking for you to join the ride and i'll teach you as you go along the way how to navigate the moment instead of you being in control like we like doing being in control of every area of our life and not surrendering to god and god is saying in you being in control you'll mess it all up but if you release control and allow me to take control i'll lead you in a course in the path like you've never seen before and the last point that i think it's important that you walk out of here with your head hell high is that you are called to refuse to give up can i can i plant a seed inside of you that when you have made the decision that you won't give up there are no more options available for you to go to when you make the decision ahead of time and get on course and you say i will not give up what you're saying is i don't offer myself any options to jump ship i'm making the decision that this is where i'll stay and this is where i'll go when it becomes uncomfortable i'll stay when things don't look the way i want them i'll stay when things get hard and i don't want to hear it i'll stay that's the kind of person that god is trying to make you to be why would god try to make me to be that because you're made in his image and likeness being conformed in this image in lightness means god's trying to make you more like him patient kind loving you're like why well i got to be like this because you're not where you need to be you didn't know that you were a deliverer moses but i had called you before you were even in your mother's womb i want to let you know today god's called you and he's already stated over your life even though life may have put you in some foggy places that makes you doubt what god is saying over your life look at where you are now you would never have thought that through all that you've been through and all that tried to destroy you and all that tried to take you out and all that tried to snatch your self-esteem and all that tried to convict you and make you look like you were crazy that you would land in the spot that you are in today pastor i am not in a phenomenal spot you didn't give up it was only by the grace of god [Music] i want to let you know the enemy had you he was going to and fro he was looking he was calling your name what about them and god was saying i'm covering them right now i'm watching over them but when they say yes you won't be able to stomp them you won't be able to keep them from my purpose that i have over their life you won't be able to take them down i promise you once they say yes stop fighting about the things that they know are you will i promise you today wherever you are you can handle it wherever life has you at the moment you can handle it whatever you're going through in this moment financial relational depression on the inside depression all around you i just been seeing oftentimes that there's such a struggle to overcome this inward sadness of where life is and people are struggling because they think they haven't gone anywhere and i'm here today to let you know the fact that you're still here says you are stronger than you think you are [Music] you're stronger than you think you are you you thought you were counted out look at you you you're still cracking a smile you're still finding something to laugh at stop being so hard on yourself as if it's over you're not finished yet i want to declare and prophesy this over your if you don't give up you will see the reward that god has for you if you don't give up the people's lives that will be impacted by your life will change god is not ready to answer a mystical prayer for you that he's empowered you to answer for yourself god's ready for you to do the work to free the people [Music] you're called to more than just yourself your call for the benefit of other people moses wasn't called to be a deliverer for himself or yet he was already free he was called to be a deliverer for god's people there is a prayer that someone is praying that you're the answer to and god is waiting for you to say yes in your burning bush moment man this world really just they need to understand and get this and you're you're dissatisfied can i i want to pull this out real quick if you're dissatisfied about something there's a reason being dissatisfied can be a really really good thing because it prompts in you to search for a solution that your hands can get involved with to make a difference in something that you don't like the way that it is and if god has put you at a space of being dissatisfied of what you see i want to tell and speak over your life today that you are the answer to your own dissatisfaction you are the answer to the prayer because you're not the only dissatisfied person but there's someone else out there praying god if you could just send a deliverer to break us out of this if you could just send us somebody who had the courage to go all the way god if you could just send an individual who cared more about people than they care about themselves i'm telling you today you would recognize oh that's [Music] the reason why the enemy is so much after you it's not because of what it will do for your life but it's about what it will do for the lives of the people that you're connected with [Music] your dissatisfaction let me give you this last piece what you're dissatisfied with the reason you're too scared to move with it is because it's outside of your comfort zone [Music] south side because you had an image and a vision and this is what you saw god was like no this is what this is what i'ma do you're like but that's not my plan and god's like i'm sorry but i didn't bring you here for your plan i brought you here for mine and at times your plan won't satisfy what you feel now but once you start walking in it you'll see everything that it's supposed to do we've been drawn into a world where we're so much trying to please ourselves that we're willing to waste time in years to satisfy things within ourselves that will never make an impact in this world and in our lives we'll leave bystanders staying where they are because we were more concerned about pleasing who we were than fulfilling the will that god has over our life you are someone's deliverer the bible says that he he said to moses come i'm sending you to egypt god's not begging you today he's calling for you come i'm taking you to a place that is going to disrupt what is most thought about in people's lives and i'm going to use you and while it may not always set with your comfort level [Music] it doesn't mean i haven't called you to it i'll never forget six years ago being called to ministry because i was dissatisfied with ministry that's where it started i was dissatisfied [Music] and this wasn't due to me deciding to be a pastor because i was bored or i couldn't make it anywhere else i took the call because there was a certain place in my life where i wasn't interested in about what i could gain [Music] i was more concerned about how i could impact i told god would whatever you want to do guns or whatever [Music] lord let me fill to that request real quick because you got to be careful what you say to god when you release [Music] because when you say i'll do whatever he'll say whatever [Music] i'll never forget doing what i love this is how this works y'all i was doing what i loved and was doing it well and god called me out of it [Music] because we think that everything god calls us to is always going to be in favor with what we want and god called me to a space that i wasn't even thinking about he calls me and says is this all you're going to do god he was a little smart that day i don't know what i don't know if he i don't know if he woke up wrong i don't know i mean i know he doesn't sleep or slumber but something happened because that was my word from the lord is this all you gonna do and i never forget in that moment the thing that i that i had to have dear that i loved that i set my whole life on i released it i released it i said whatever your will is if i don't get to do that you will be done if i don't get to go that way your will be done if it doesn't look like i set it all up and the plan that i had all constructed it will be done and he said my will and i said well can you give me some like table of contents to your will or something like that can we look over gonna get a briefing all of us we want a briefing what is what's in your will what i got to give up who i got [Music] what we got to stop doing [Music] let that burn let that bush burn [Music] will catch me in this [Music] god's caught you to something and that something isn't about you it's about who he's calling for you to be a deliverer to [Music] today i just want to speak over your life that you're not finished you're not you're just not finished with your goals [Music] you're not finished with the will that god has set over your life here's what i say i'm not gonna give you a 2022 message like try god in the new year no try god today and let him do whatever he wants to do in your life you have done some crazy things in your life already that you know you shouldn't even be here to testify about let alone trust god who has the perfect plan for your life and what's the best for you what is there to count he already counted the cost today i implore you i want to let you know you're not finished yet and don't you settle for where you are because god has more for you today can we celebrate god for his word today [Applause] [Music] god wants you to stop just talking with him he wants y'all to be talking talking can you get off of a mediocre relationship with god can y'all start talking talking like he's worthy like he's worth it can you put some time into him can you give him some moments of your day that he'll direct and guide your path and i believe today you'll see more than you could ever imagine i think everything we have belongs to the lord when we praise him father in the name of jesus we thank you for this moment we thank you for the power of your spirit in this moment father we declare that we understand we're not finished so god help us to realize and understand it and understand the clarity of where you have for us to go help us to say yes to your will and yes to your way we love you we honor and thank you in jesus name we say amen i talked about for the first point someone needs to make a decision and today [Music] i believe that someone is here someone is online and your first decision is to follow jesus your heart may have been in a place where you've like i've heard about this gospel and i'm just trying to feel it out and i just want to let you know time doesn't give us the time to feel out god we can understand him better by and by that's what they used to say but more and more as time goes on but i am imploring somebody today that you need to accept jesus into your life give him the permission to work through your problems and through your misunderstandings and through the areas where you don't know if you believe but you need to have jesus in your life you need to allow him to be your savior and lord or somebody in here is just you didn't commit your heart to god you just like i've been coming to church i've just kind of been doing i'm ready to take that next level that next step of following god all the way if you're online and that's you on the count of three i want you to write in the comment section i need jesus and if you're here today in this audience on the count of three i just want you to raise your hand we're gonna do this in this moment all together we're not we don't care who's in front and we don't care who's behind looking at us we're making this decision for jesus ready on the count of three one two three let me see those hands i'll see you in here don't be ashamed absolutely absolutely absolutely you can put your hand down amen i i want to pray a prayer with you it's not the prayer that saves you it really is your heart to god this is a you and god moment i can't confirm or unconfirm this with you this is about you and god and as we pray this prayer together i want you to believe that god is doing a work in your life and he will change you day by day repeat after me say lord jesus i need you thank you for accepting me just as i am forgive me for my sins i receive you as my lord and savior and i commit to putting you first in my life take control of the throne of my life and make me who you want me to be in jesus name we say amen come on help me celebrate big those who made that decision today hallelujah [Applause] saw some amazing
