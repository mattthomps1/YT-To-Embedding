confident and capable and ladies i want to let you know it's going to be a moment to remember it's going to be something special anybody glad to be in the house of the lord today amen let's jump into the word of god today on this special day i want you to get your notepads out your bibles out whatever it is that you write with whatever it is that you read with here we understand that notetakers are what world changers and readers are what readers are leaders and so today we're going to be reading the word of god which will lead us into truth the bible lets us know that in that truth it shall set us free and through that freedom we can live the most abundant life possible that god has for us and so we're going to jump in the word of god today we are in the book of luke chapter 15 luke chapter 15 and i'm excited to get into this word on today we were just singing a song and it's called ringing robe and it's welcoming home whom the father has called jesus said to those that are part of the religious leaders he said i i didn't come for those who are righteous he said but i came for those who are broken who are sinners who are far removed he said i i i i i came to heal and to mend the brokenhearted i came for those that recognized that i don't have it all together i'm not perfect i don't know everything he said i came for the people that made some mistakes anybody ever had made some mistakes before you felt i know you can you like can you be honest you just know you're not perfect anybody know that on your way here you might have had a moment with somebody in traffic don't say nothing just you you were trying to get here on time but somebody hindered you i'm not going to say it was your spouse or your children but i want to let you know today that the lord is still with you regardless of what you said i'm here to tell you today that the lord is with us david said the lord of hosts is with us he said the god of jacob is our refuge today and i want to talk about that how he is our refuge we're going to read in luke chapter 15 verse 17 through 24 and preceding this the scripture talks about a son a son and a father a son who had an inheritance that was to be given to him upon the death of his father an inheritance is not something that you are supposed to receive until the person that has left it to you passes away in this scripture context that we're going to read the son has come to the father and what he has done is asking him to receive his inheritance early because he believes that he is owed and do something because he is the son of a rich man the bible lets us know that this father grants the wish of his son and the son goes out into the world to enjoy himself the bible says that after enjoying himself he ran out of money and when he ran out of money it said that everybody left him all the people he thought were his friends his boys his homies everyone that wanted him for what he had the bible said they left him and things got so tough that the son became enslaved to a man of the country the man of the country put him in charge of his pigs the problem is is that this was a young jewish boy and this young jewish boy had an issue with pigs because according to the law of god he was not supposed to mix because if he mixed with the things that were not of god he was unclean but things got so desperate for him that the bible says while he was in the hog pin he was so tempted by his desperation that he started looking at what the pigs were eating as a possible source of his [Music] food [Music] i want to read the scripture because some of us have gotten so desperate in life that we've ended up in places that we said we would never go saying things we would never say and doing things we would never do and the yearning that is on the inside of us has become so strong and it's not for god but it's for the things of our own life that we've sacrificed who we are just to be able to make it to the next moment this is where we picked up the story it gets better the bible lets us know in verse 17. it starts off real good it says but when he came to himself can i tell somebody you got to come to yourself sometimes sometimes you need somebody to grab you and shake you so you can get it together so you can get your act together and say this is not who you are the bible tells us he thought about that thing and he said it said he came to himself and he said this how many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread but i perish here with hunger he said i will arise and go to my father and i will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son treat me as one of your hired servants [Music] the bible says and he rose and he came to his father but a good father a good a real good father is always awaiting the return of a lost child they never stop looking they they never stop viewing over the hill they they never stop peering in the in the in the horizon to see if they see an image that may look like someone that represents their son the bible says but while he was still a long way off the bible lets us know it says his father saw him and felt compassion it said and ran and embraced him and says and he kissed them and the son said to him father i've sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son he said but the father said to his servants bring quickly the best i if i could just whisper something to you real quick if you could know how much god has for your life you would know he has nothing but the best for you whatever it is that you think you're going through god says there's something greater i have the best just tell your neighbor real quick god's got the best for you he said bring the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the fattened calf come on we gonna eat today if he was hungry god said i'll feed you it doesn't matter where you it says get and kill it and let us eat somebody say let's celebrate my god we got we we got to party we we got to have a good time i don't know what's wrong with with y'all y'all a little too quiet because it's a party today i don't know we're celebrating today we're [Applause] you know why heaven is rejoicing right now because because god god is seeing you where you are and he saw you afar off and he's rejoicing and it says why he said for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and he is found and they begin to celebrate can help somebody help me celebrate god in this place oh [Applause] i want to come from this topic today it's not what i thought it's not what i thought can you pray with me father in the name of jesus this moment that you've given us we want to be hearers of your word but not only hearers we want to be doers appliers of this very word that you have given us let our hearts be changed in this moment through your word for we love honor and thank you in jesus name we pray amen gentlemen real quick gentlemen can y'all bring that up for me just a little bit more up here thank you so much so grateful for my band can y'all give it up for our worship team uh come on y'all keep come on now we all right all right god bless you god bless you thank you guys appreciate y'all all right they're not the beatles now they're not the beatles all right um can you help me give it up for our dream team that's making all this happen right now man i have the best team in the world [Applause] i want to talk to you about this story because the story is so relevant to the moment that we're in understanding that it is easter sunday what we call resurrection the clarity of understanding is that we're celebrating that jesus and whom came down from heaven in sinful flesh yet did not have sin came in his greatness to understand that we were laden and covered with our mess i don't know if you can remember your past but most of us i got a little bit of mess going on i got i got some stuff i don't like talking about anybody got some stuff you don't like talking about just keep that thing on a hush don't give it out to everybody don't tell everybody what i'm doing don't let people know my business and my business is my business keep it to myself but the bible lets us know that he came so that he could cover our sins the bible says no he came before we even came to him that's the kind of god that he is and so what i i want to get you to understand this morning is how important it is to understand the love of god in your life how much god loves you and cares for you and as your father he will do anything for you to see you come home i'll never forget when my daughter kirsten was five years old and and and and we were just enjoying life together we went on anybody know that field trip you got to go with your children you act like you like it you do but you don't you're trying to figure out why you got to go and why no other parents can go and my wife looks at me and says hey uh kirsten has a field trip today i need you to go i looked at her and said uh there are two of us here why has got to be me she said i need you to go i'm working today i said i have a job too but obviously you don't respect it so what i did was is i signed a permission slip i find myself in the place where i'm on a cheese bus everybody knows there's a little bit of an error of smell that comes from that cheesebus kids are getting on they're sitting next to me and then and i'm like whose child is this can someone move this child to the side and and what i start to notice is that we're going to y'all the pumpkin patch come on now there's nothing like the pumpkin patch to pick out a pumpkin for the children who can't use the knife so they can't carve it out which means the working responsibility is on me as the parent so basically i'm going to pick my own pumpkin so that i can carve it out so that i can place it where it needs to be placed because my child does not have the ability to do that of themselves we get on the trip and we get into the pumpkin patch and we begin to walk in everybody knows the pumpkin patch is wonderful i planned though wrongly because i put in on an outfit thinking i was hanging out with a group of adults the problem was i was not and so the shoes that i wore as i walked in the muddy ground or oven to the pumpkin patch sends me into a place where they open the gates and there are children running array behind me in front of me all around me as all the little children of the world red and yellow black and white they are precious in his sights to me they weren't at the moment i just wanted to get through and looking at what was available i said to my daughter oh you want to go do something fun she said yes i begin to walk her to what was a cow a calf that was sitting in a barn and the option that she had was to be able to go milk the cow to me that sounds like an experience let's go let's have fun let's be a part of enjoying all of this moment because according to me it's not happening again i get in a place we get up to it i say sweetheart hey you want to milk the cow she looks at me as if i have lost all of my mind and says to me ill no in all of my logic i cannot figure out why she would not want to be a part of taking this cow and going under it and beginning to squeeze back and forth now as i think about it a little bit further i think it was pretty disgusting myself but i was trying to find something for her to engage in she rejects it i don't want to do that that's not why i don't want to be a part of that and what i start to notice is that my daughter has so many of the particulars that my wife has and she's got these little things she won't do the way she won't do it how she won't do it and i start to look at it and i said to myself are we all just a little bit particular in how we want to do things all of us got to live out our lives i know i got some people i don't want you to raise your hand but you have a little bit of ocd you know when you walk in you got to put everything you get a little attitude when somebody moves the cup off the wrong place they shoved it in the wrong cabinet on the wrong side all of your juices were lined up properly now you got a bad attitude because the oj's over here and the water's on this side and you to label all the cabinets and put everything into place and now you upset and there's no jesus on the inside of you cause somebody done wrecked up your control freak life and all of us have our desires of the things we like and we don't like we do and we don't want to do the way we do it and how we do it and the way that we're looking to do it and so all of us have a way in which we're doing it but here's the thing if we wanted to we could the problem was is that in this scenario you had a prodigal son meaning one who has gone away one who has disconnected himself from the father and where he finds himself is in a place where he's legally not supposed to be the place he's in the the area that he has placed himself in is in a hog pin and again i here to tell you is that that this hog pin is representative of being unclean and as a jew you don't attach yourself to the things of this world and so you stay away because if you stay away you don't find yourself at an anger with god here's the problem so many of us have found ourselves in compromising places in our life where we've said we would never do this but we've done it and god said don't do it you're like but god if i do i can i please if i can try to you know you just don't understand what's on the inside of me and today i'm trying to let you know is that what's happening here is that the son is saying i have something better if i can muster up the idea that there's greater for me with my father can i tell you today that your father has greater for you if you could understand that he wants nothing but the best for your life the problem that you get is into the raffling of ideas that your way is better than god's way anybody ever thought that my way is better than god i promise you god if you can just watch how i do it you'll learn something anybody i've been there for come on y'all know y'all been there before found myself in a place i want to show god god let me tell you how this goes let me tell you the conspiracy of what's happening in life let me show you and if i can show you you would believe me and if you would believe me you would understand that i know how to do my own life i just need your assistance when things aren't going the way i like that's how we prefer our relationship with god let god intercede when we can't do it any further but from here i got it because most of us don't understand that we are a control freak over our own lives because we have not surrendered them as paul said he said i urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies as living sacrifices the problem is is we don't like laying down our lives and sacrifices because the sacrifice means i've got to give up something if i got to give up something then i'm losing who i am but the problem is is is that we don't know who we are because god is the one who gives us the clarity about who we are and he gives us the understanding to discover the what the purpose that's in our life but the problem is is i know more than god so i always are winning my own battles that leave me in the place where i wind up in the hog pins of life that i never said i would go to the places that i said i would never think the things i i do in the corner that nobody knows about the way that my marriage and my relationships and i find myself living in my shame and in my brokenness and the problem with my shame and my brokenness is that i stay in it so long that it becomes the norm instead of freedom some of us have been living in such a broken state for so long that we've adapted our lives into the way that the brokenness leaves us and so we've adapted and comfort and surrounded ourselves around this broken way of thinking this broken way of perceiving things this broken idea that this is all that we can do and god says i have the best for you but the problem is is i can't get down off my high horse because i think so better of myself the bible says that i should the bible lets us know that any of us in here that know jesus we aren't saved of ourselves we're saved by somebody say grace ah tell your neighbor you ain't do it you ain't doing it you're saved by god's grace let me open this up real quick a little bit more for you because the clarity and understanding is because i'm saved by the grace of god means i'm indebted to god because i owe him something and if i owe him something it means i've got to repay well what do i have that i can offer unto god what do i have that i can give over to him he says offer yourself which means there's a part of me that's going to have to disappear but the bible said it he said because when i get saved when i become new in him i become a new creature in christ jesus the bible says all things have passed away and behold all things become somebody say new you're looking new over there you got your new clothes on you got your fresh guild you got your easter outfit on you over there looking new the problem is is that so many of us can look new on the outside while still acting old on the inside [Applause] dude you got to tell somebody you ain't fooling nobody you're still dealing with some of that same shame some of that same brokenness and the day the father is saying the whole reason that i'm bringing you in is because i'm here to remove all the broken patterns that have been over your life you're not supposed to stay the same i'm called to change i'm called to be brand new stop thinking where you are is okay i don't like this part of me i don't like the way i'm thinking i don't like the way that i'm acting why because it's not the nature of god you're filled with the nature of god if you were the idea to know that god loves you and he cares so much for you that he says i don't like the way that you are god sees you in your brokenness and your shame in your anxiety in your depression he sees you in your room staring at the walls and crying he sees you in the moments where you're thinking about the losses of your life and here's what it's doing it's affecting the way that you see yourself and because you see yourself that way you can't pull yourself together to understand that you are a king's kid do you know how great you are do you know how amazing you are do you know what lies on the inside of you that has not been fully fulfilled and the purpose has not fully come into it but here's the thing if you have settled in your space of life that this is all i'm going to do why because divorce has hit my home so i'm settling in that this is the way that it's going to be nobody's going to love me i've had a kid out of wedlock this is the way that it's going to be no one's going to ever find love in me so i can only find it in myself this is the way that i'm going to be i feel shameful i didn't raise my kids can i bring it to real life and not leave it in the bible days can i bring it in some real spaces i feel broken my kids feel broken i feel shameful i'm walking on eggshells and i haven't been able to declare that god loves me so much that i can release the broken places of my past and where i've come from to take hold of the future that god has for me so i stay in my pen doing pin like things never seeing the reality of who god's called me to be and the problem is is that so many times we're wrapped up in what we used to be we can't focus on who we're becoming what if the idea of what god wanted to do in your life is change everything about you fulfill every broken area every area of deserting every area of senses of not understanding the areas where you made 17 mistakes and yesterday you made that 18th mistake but yet god is saying i still love you i am still committed to you you are still worthy you are still a part of my plan i have not dropped you i have not left you and you could actually believe that whatever god said is his word because the bible lets us know that god cannot lie you got to establish something in yourself if god said it about me that's who i am if god has established it in my life that's who i am you got to button that thing up and put yourself together and say it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you know about my past i'm here today to let you know that god is faithful and whatever he wants to do in my life it is yes and amen once he spoke it it is so [Applause] it doesn't matter what it looks like it doesn't matter what somebody said it doesn't matter your opinion i am everything who god says i am and the potential is there inside of me but the bible says you've got to come to yourself you got to come to yourself you got to come to a place where you look at yourself and say to yourself this is not who i am tell your neighbor real quick that's not who you are oh my goodness it's not who you are here's the crazy part why you're so scared to tell your neighbor because the problem is is if you tell your neighbor then you've declared it to them and they've declared it to you so you don't look at me like no don't say that on me because what you're going to do is require me to do something about what you said because the bible lets us know that this word we're just not hearers of it but we gotta be doers and so i don't want to be accountable for doing if i don't hear but the clarity that you must understand is there's greater on the inside of you there's more inside of you there's something in you that you've never experienced before who are you who are you really who are you on the inside of you that people have not seen the ideas that are in your head the things that are in your heart to develop will we ever see it or will we have to contend with the idea that you will stay who you are until the day you die as long as you can get your retirement some of us care more about our retirement than our purpose we got strategies if i put it over here and then i put an interest over here then when it accumulates i'll put it all together then when we move we'll go over there and we should be set for life and god says i've got purpose all over your life i'll take care of you and you won't even need a retirement because i'm all over your life i have the best for you [Applause] i'm about my way on over here because what i'm trying to get you to understand in the clarity of the greatness that's inside of you and if you settle all you do is settle for your potential that is laid to waste but today i think i think god's calling you home i think god's calling you home i think god's finally calling you to the place where he's not okay with you just being okay you're saying come on come home there's something greater i've got for you come home you're like i don't when i come home there's a whole bunch of rules and regulations anybody ever know that you ever moved back with your parents before you ever been there before don't put your hand up this okay you don't have to do it don't do it cause when you move back with your parents there's rules and regulations don't touch the tv turn it off at 10 o'clock when you see that dishcloth over the sink kitchen's close what the what do you mean the kitchen's closed there's no door on it kitchen's closed lock it up don't touch nothing better not hear nothing you start moving what you doing oh my gosh i don't want to go back home the problem is is that so many people move out too fast that they haven't built what they need to actually go to the next level of where they need to go can i tell you something about that little five-year-old girl that i went to uh the pumpkin patch with that five-year-old girl is still in the house and she's telling me emphatically i'm not going anywhere ain't going nowhere she said to me the other day what's the next house we moving in i said you're doing a lot of wii and you don't speak a lick of french ain't no french in here we when we when we go and when it's our vacation i said we we we we we this is not a together scenario that we put together here's what she understands there's blessings in the father's house i don't need to go anywhere until somebody else can take care of me i'm good and while i want to put out mike i love it don't you go nowhere don't you mess up and get in something that you can't get yourself out don't you find yourself in a hog pin that you can't get yourself out of stay home build what you need to build but stay home too many times we're trying to push our children out into something that we haven't built them for [Music] or they need to learn they need to be taught but here's what i want to say to you today we're in position for god as he's welcoming us home to be in a place where we say god you know what i accept everything that you want to give me everything in this moment your salvation your joy your love your truth your freedom i want it all tell somebody i want it all oh my god i want everything that god has for me and nothing less i want everything that god has for me and nothing less to walk in power and dominion to have everything he's called me to to stop chasing jobs but having jobs chase me that's the place where god is calling us to here's what i want you to know it's not what you thought when you come back home the father is saying yes there are boundaries because the boundaries are created out of my love and my love for you covers you and because i'm covering you i'm trying to keep you out of the mess that i've seen others go through god is not trying to hinder you he's trying to keep you so he says welcome home welcome to the place where i can grow you and develop you and make you brand new and bring a fresh thought to your mind and to still teach you and to give you a way of clarity and understanding so that the world does not control your thinking the first thing i want you to do and understanding is not what i thought when you when you're sitting in a place and you're thinking it's all about the shame and the brokenness of where you are the things that are are so uh locked up in your past i want to let you know that god loves covers your sin the love of god covers your sin the love of god covers your brokenness the love of god covers everything that you think is wrong about you and i'm here today to let you know is that god sees everything on the inside that needs to be taken care of he's like i got you don't you even worry john 3 16 says this for god so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that he even gave his one and only begotten son that whoever believes and trusts in him as savior shall not perish but have eternal life anything you can think of right now god says my blood covers it that thought that came up that you're like for real he says my blood covers it that thing you thought about that you like listen i can't share this with nobody because if i share with somebody they're gonna have a real problem if they know the real me like the real me not the real me but the real real me because everything in this life must have two in order to be serious not real life but real real if there's something in your life that you're shameful of he says my blood covers it see that's what today was about it was about his blood covering every broken area of my life everything that i messed up in everything that i failed in the areas where i let myself go and nobody even knows about it the secret moments where my depression kicks in and makes me do things and have habits that i i i'm not not not sharing with anybody and i'm keeping in the secret corners he's saying the day my blood can cover all your mess and i'm here today to tell you you're not that far from god he's been waiting for you he's been looking for you he's been looking over the hill to see if you were coming today he he he purposely had someone tag you and call you and give you an invitation because he's been looking for you and he's just like if you just could come home i promise you there's joy in my home there's peace in my house there is deliverance in my house there is a mind that is free in my house someday if you can just come home the bible lets us know that jesus went to calvary for our sins and that blood that he shed on calvary's cross is to cover my sins but the covering of my sins has no worthiness unless through him rising from the dead that there is still power in his hand and the bible lets me know that he went down into the grave but it says something about there was a third day something some something you ever notice everything things start taking a long time you lose your lose your debit card three to five business days everything's three it's not two you got to express it it's three to five businesses we got to take three to five why did it take three because jesus wasn't in the grave he was in hell making sure he could so that you no longer have to be fearful but through eternal life you can live each and every day saying i am all that god romans chapter 5 verse 8 says but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners christ died already knowing how jacked up you were would be and still are he said i'ma die for you why wouldn't anybody do something for you previous to you doing it knowing that you were going to still do it regardless of knowing that when you did it you didn't do it so now that you did it he's got to do something about what you did tweet that [Applause] because the perspective is is he knew you the bible says before you were in your mother's womb he knew you he knew how you would mess up he knew you wouldn't get it right all the time so he said i'm going to sin my son and his death is going to cover your sins that's why first john 4 10 says true love is god's love for us not our love for god it said god sent his son to die in our place you were supposed to pay the penalty for your sin and jesus said hold up i'll do it it says to take away our sins point number two it's god's love covers our shame i don't know about you there's some areas in my life i'm not too proud about there's some there's some spaces where if you knew the thoughts if there were bubbles you would pull me off this this stage immediately because you would say he's unfit i'm here today to let you know that the blood of jesus covers the love of god covers all of your shame all of the areas that you just wish that you had never done never said it covers your your childhood those days it covers all of your middle school years it covers your high school it covers your what you did in college some of y'all that went to college ought to praise god thank you god jesus oh god i thank you cause i didn't know you and jesus knows i'm just trying to tell y'all we can be real in here because we be trying to look snazzy and have it all together i went to school and i got all my grades and i i stayed focused no you didn't no you didn't had instagram be out you all would be messed up we'd be going back like no you can't pray for me [Music] the bible says it covers all our shame all those insecurities on the inside all those areas of your life where you're finding yourself that you know it's not right it's not where you are you know it's not god's heart where you are you know it's not god's plan for your life it says it covers the shame and it says it covers that shame not to leave you in shame but to change where you are so that you can experience new life in him the bible lets us know in john 10 and 10 it says for the thief comes to steal and kill and destroy but he says jesus said i come that you might have life and have it to the full the question is are you living a full life are you piecing off potential pieces of your life enough just to save where you are knowing that there is greater destiny for you today i want to let you know he covers all our shame whatever you feel shameful about god says don't even worry about it i'm covering it but lord i have i'm covering it don't worry about it but lord you remember that i'm covering it but you know it i'm covering it can you just tell your neighbor he covered it come on tell somebody else on the other side he covered it tell your third choice even though you're my third choice he covered it isn't it so good that he covered it can we just get a five second praise for what god covered over our lives child you don't know what i did ciao you don't know where i came from

scripture lets us know in psalm 34 4-5 he said i sought the lord david said he said and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears i hear the lord saying today i'm here to deliver you from all your fears i'm here to deliver you from the things that have kept you from pursuing who i've called for you to be and not that he only just delivered me from all my fears it says those who look to him are radiant and their faces shall never be ashamed you can't hold it over my head you can't keep pulling it up from my past i'm forgiven and you won't see shame on my face because i've accepted my forgiveness point number three we're out of here as god's love restores our hope today some of us have gotten to a place where we've almost entered into the place of hopelessness and we're saying to ourselves there's there's got to be a better way there's got to be a greater way but some of us are giving up and we're looking for things to fulfill us and i want to let you know today is that why god will bless you with the things he's going to call you to this moment of a brand new future you're not who you were but you're being made brand new julio can you come out for a second the bible lets us know yeah if you could just stay in here and says the father saw the son here's what the son was doing all right all right so here's here's what i gotta do i i gotta all right i'm gonna tell my father all right all right i'ma say it i'ma say it stern though like dad no that's not good no i gotta say it better than dad ah i gotta come more humble than that all right father i know i messed up i know i i know i know i don't have it all together but i know this is not where i'm supposed to be the bible says that while there may be things in your life and there's so many things we could have put on this shirt it said that because the father was in anticipation because he was waiting to forgive and waiting to love he said the father got excited yeah you ever know your child is supposed to get it but something about the moment that your heart melts for them and to end it all you say let's just go get some ice cream and they looking at you like what but i messed up [Music] i when i mess up i i get in trouble when i mess up i'm being taught that every mess up is met with a penalty and jesus says your shame and your brokenness and your hurt is enough of the penalty for you to receive the bible says in anticipation as the son is making his way back home and he's beginning to explain it's like i messed up i made the wrong decision i i said that out my mouth i turn to the things of this world i i keep getting addicted i keep living in depression and anxiety and anger i keep hating myself i keep thinking i'm the issue and i'm the problem he says i know i'm gonna have to hear this from my father when i get there so i'm just i'm getting myself together and i'll just take it and it says the father who is so loving he says i see my son coming i see my daughter coming they didn't let their brokenness hinder them from coming i see them from afar it says when he when he got close he said there was such a celebration that he found himself in a place where he he yelled to his servants get the best robe and the bible says he they went and ran and it went and said okay we got you we got you here you go and it says they begin to put it on them and you know what it did the robe covered [Music] it says i got you you set your mind but he also wanted to let him know that not only as a father was he covering him but he was putting him back in position and so he said i'm not only going to cover you but but but i got this ring for you it says and i want to put this ring on you and and and i want you to know that let me get a pinky because that's where the real play is put it all out let me get that he said i'm going to cover your sin and i'm going to put you right back to where i already had you he says i'm not demoting your purpose i'm not taking away your purpose i'm not taking away your blessings everything that's done in heaven shall be done on earth he said i've got you covered he says i place you back in the position being a son and being a son still means there's still an inheritance [Music] and everything that god has for you i want to let you know today is still for you you have not been revoked you have not been put to side you have not been revoked
