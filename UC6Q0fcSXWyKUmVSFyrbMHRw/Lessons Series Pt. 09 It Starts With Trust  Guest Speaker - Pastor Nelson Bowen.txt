this i am so grateful to be finally at the mix church man this is like the best kept secret in baltimore and it won't be a secret for long i was uh looking at this wall here and i just began even during worship just praying and believing god that you're not going to be able to come to baltimore without stopping at the mix first and knowing that this is a place where you know god dwells and uh i i just love your pastor so much pastor marcus and pastor michi they are the world's finest pastors man they love you it's no way you cannot have a conversation with pastor marcus without talking about this church and how much he loves it and how much he's here for you guys and i'm just grateful to be a part of it and grateful to know him and uh can we just show him some honor and show him some okay if you're watching us online man keep tuning in you guys are at a great place while you're at home i gotta tell you this if you haven't been in the building yet uh you're absolutely missing it this is just a phenomenal place for sure uh i was with you guys back in 2019 when we were at the school and that was the day that i was doing a gender reveal for my sunday didn't y'all remember that what now you know it's my son but uh uh well i bring you greetings from my wife her name is archelle bowen and uh that is the most beautiful chick in the world that's my shorty there god oh boy i'm telling you i i i i picked well well here's what you got to know even as a spouse your spouse is a product of your intelligent decision so let that sit with you with whatever and uh we had a gender reveal and here's who showed up next mr ace bowen that is my man that is my that's my main man that's my best friend like for real like that's my homie and many of you might remember from that message the message called digging ditches i was actually declared to be infertile uh i we tried for years and uh so you can't be scared to get information and so i went and got information and the information said that i was infertile now that's okay because every need i mean every name must bow to the name of jesus and so i went just to get information so i could submit that to the holy spirit and it would be amazing if god just blessed me with ace but nine weeks ago check this out he also blessed me with with my man win uh so i got ace and i got win and so everyone said oh you're gonna name your second son deuce no i'm not gonna name him dudes any spades players in the house you play the ace to do what to win come on now so so so that's my people but i really it was uh all i do is win no matter what like that that's really what it was and that's my family and i love them to death they are just my absolute favorite people uh on the earth i promise you uh jared is with me from my church and he knows when churches oh i'm like all right i'm ready to go home i want to see my family i want to get with them and i'm ready to preach you guys ready for the word yeah are you ready for the word okay uh i told them this in the first experience and i mean this with everything in me i know y'all have just finished eating more macaroni and cheese than you probably i couldn't care if i saw i only eat mac and cheese once a year because you know between thanksgiving and christmas you're going to eat it like god dawg i don't want no more mac and cheese okay so so here's what i told him i need you to look your neighbor looking they were dead in the eye are you looking dead are you are you looking at your neighbor there tonight and say if you go to nappy i'm gonna go to slavin and you say you you better not put your hands on me i tell you that put your hands so no we're gonna have some fun we're gonna have some fun uh i hear you guys are in part 97 of lessons [Laughter] and some people like stop talking about my damn faster stop talking about my best but no no i hear you guys are in lessons and and me and pastor marcus was talking about it and we just thought it would be kind of amazing for us to give you some perspective for me to give you some perspective and share on something that i think is going to challenge you for sure is what i just said it's going to challenge you but i also think that it has the potential to change your life okay if i had something to tell you and i knew it would hurt but it would still benefit you would you still want to hear it some of y'all like uh i mean okay i want to share some stuff with you that i believe has the potential to change your financial life as you know it but let me make this really clear i don't want anything from you i got is what i say at my church my seed take care of my need i don't want anything from you i know pastor mark just don't want anything from you i know for sure this the mixed church doesn't want anything from you instead we want something for you and what i want for you is not because it's what i want it's because i believe it's what god wants for every single person in this room are you hear what i'm saying if truth be told and true should be told we all could learn how to do our money better but also how to acquire more of it okay the real folks over here there is a way that god has intended for us to handle our finances okay scripture says there's a way that seems right to a man but that way ends in destruction and so we got to get to the point where we are going to handle our finances the way god has intended for us to handle them and when you do that i promise you three things are available here's the first you will have ever you will live under an open heaven be on a shot of a doubt you'll live under open heaven you'll have all of your needs met and and you will begin to be able to be generous no matter what this circumstance calls for and oftentimes when i start talking about finances here's what comes next people start saying well i'm just gonna pray that god bless me financially anyone god would you just bless my fine god please please please bless my finances god oh please god and so many times we're praying to god for the blessing and we're praying to god to bless us financially and what if i told you that if you're doing that you're wasting your time and some of y'all be like oh no no no you ain't no real pastor i want to show you in scripture why that's a waste of your time we got five pillars at our church that fifth one is sound biblical preaching and teaching meaning i'm not going to preach anything that's not in this bible go to ephesians chapter number one verse number three watch this ephesians chapter number one verse number three i'm gonna teach a message called it starts with trust it starts with trust okay this is apostle paul's preaching apostle paul said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ watch this who has has all right virtual learning you ready it has present future or past tense it's past it's past tense so here you have apostle paul saying okay blessed be the god of our father lord jesus christ who has past tense has done what blessed is blessed past future or present tense past blessed ed at the end blessed means past it's it's past tense so here there's the apostle paul saying listen praise be to the lord god our father jesus christ who has past tense blessed well question the question has to be what blessed us with what every okay his next question what does every leave out oh so it leaves out nothing so he's blessed us with every spiritual blessing every leaves nothing else so is finances included oh good job glass so here's what he's just said look apostle paul just said man god has already blessed you with every spiritual blessing okay i got this money in my pocket if i gave you this money take that if i gave you that money do you have to pray for it help me class does he have to pray for that money and the reason why he don't have to pray for it is why because he already have it i don't have to pray for what i already possess and what i'm telling you is that you already possessed every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places so as it relates to your financial increase in your financial blessings you already possess it and because you already possessed it you don't have to pray for it so the question really becomes how then do i access what god has already made available for me oh this is some good teacher here's what we say at our church you're ready if it's good you say this is good groceries it's good groceries hold on to that for a second he said i got you i know you do i know you do i know you did okay okay okay what i found though is that for many of us church should be fun guys but what i found before is that many of us have a misappropriation of trust okay go to psalms 84 verse number 11. psalms 84 verse number 11. it says for the lord god is a son and a shield i love that he's a provider and a protector the lord bestows favor and honor some of y'all need to stand on this verse no good thing god dawg there's no good thing there's nothing that's good that he's going to withhold see some of you got to get that perspective that if it's good gotta give it if it's good god will give it if it's good god will give it if it's good okay now you have to go further if it's good and it belongs to me god will give it if it's good and it belongs to me god will give it no good thing will he withhold listen from those who walk uprightly for those who walk righteous for those who are in good standing with him every good thing with your name on it belongs to you oh lord of hosts watch this blessed blessed will i just say past tense blessed is the one who what how am i blessed the one who trusts in you trust is present tense here but your present tense of trusting gives you the past tense of the god dawg of the blessing now listen here's what holy spirit or here's what the writers psalm is trying to get you understand when you trust god trust means to make my first choice and it's easy i got a little bit more time in the second experience so i can have some fun it's so easy it's so easy to make uh uh god your first choice when things are going well and it's so easy to make god your first choice when things are going the way you want them to go and it's so easy to make god your first choice when everything has fallen the way you wanted it to fall it's difficult to make god your first choice when things aren't the way you wanted to heaven and it's difficult to choose god first when it's not going the way you wanted to go but the writer's psalm says this if you'll make god your first choice then you'll be blessed [Applause] not my word that's god's word are you sticking with me because i can't preach it to to lay the foundation the foundation already says in the book of ephesians that i've already have every spiritual blessing he's already done it for me then i come over here to the book of psalms and psalms says that if i'll make god my first priority he'll bless me what does bless me blessed means empowered to have success and so when i trust in god i'm empowered in every area to have success in every area of my life so then i gotta come over here to proverbs proverbs is written by king solomon king solomon is the wisest man to ever live proverbs 11 28 says this whoever trusts let me get that money back player i'll give it back to you who whoever trusts present tense in his riches this money will fall okay okay okay okay okay it's this this all right solomon says man if you trust in this money you're gonna fall but i think it's so ironic that this is what we put our trust in i think it's ironic that that like the bizarre thing the wild thing the interesting thing the crazy thing the give me another attitude give me something else the what the phenomenal thing yeah whatever it is is that we will spend our entire lives trying to figure out how to put security in this this thing keeps us up at night you will allow this to rob you of sweet sleep [Music] and he says if you put your trust in this it's for certain you're going to fall but the thing that just blows my mind is the theme that we're not supposed to put our trust in that so many of us does actually tells us what to put our trust in i don't care if it's the one all the way up to the hunted to hunt it if you look at that this thing tell you put your trust in god [Applause] and yet so many of us have not gotten to the place where this thing here is the thing that we're willing to trust god with and i want to show you today in scripture how we're going we're going to fix this thing here we're going to fix it this thing is is meant to be a tool it's a resource it's not the source and if you keep thinking that's your source you're going okay okay okay i almost thought i was at home jared you know i'll get to talking for real okay okay luke 16 1 luke 16 1. hurry up you playing too much now he also said this is jesus speaking now jesus is getting ready to give this parable that blows my mind but luke 16 1 he also said to disciples there was what there was a rich man come on you should insert your name there there was nelson there was whatever your name is you a rich man rich woman right come on bible says call those things that being okay listen guys if you're not gonna be come on come on who had a manager now the word the actual word here for manager translates to mean steward if you're reading the king james version that's probably the word that's you steward now there was a steward the steward is someone who was responsible for the masters affairs the stuff that belonged to the master and so it would be his land his finances his resources his stuff oftentimes the master would leave what was known as a steward in charge are you with me say i'm on the same page okay perfect i'm glad you i'm glad you said that okay so the steward was responsible for managing the master stuff so while it may look like the steward had it he didn't own it he managed it but he didn't own it here's the number one question you're going to have to ask if you're going to want to see yourself get to the next level as it pertains to your finances whose money is it anyway don't get so quiet now whose money is it anyway and here's what i found it's so easy for us to say god you can have my life we sing a song my life is not my own to you i belong and we love it you can have my life god you can wherever you tell me to go it's where i'm gonna go ah god it's yours it's all yours okay okay he can have your life here's the question i got can he have your stuff he can have your life but can he have your stuff listen now my my oldest boy ace that's my that is my i'm telling you i'm for real that's my man like that's come on when you wasn't supposed to have one and then you get one you know what i'm saying that's my man but i got a problem with ace now i got a problem for real we got we gotta we got some issues and we got a real issue we had to settle in our house because someone taught him this word and i'm trying to figure out who taught it because i didn't teach it to him so i go to his mama you know i'm going to his mom and dad because you you taught him that word i ain't telling that word well where he get it from i literally i'm the parent i asked i said did y'all teach him this word and they said no we we ain't teaching that what we got issued him where'd he get it from where he get this word from and the word that i'm talking about is mine let me know i got an issue because you don't own nothing in this house everything mine and you talking about my mine my i mean even when we get those pictures taken it was a card and said i'm trying to take the card mine and he start it's mine mine and way before he knew the word he knew the action my son got a death grip too he was not he was not going to let that thing go and i'm like who taught you this parents isn't it funny that we never had to teach our children how to keep we never had to teach them how to keep how about this we never had to teach them how to take what we do got to teach them is how to give what we do got to teach them is how to share why because it's in their nature it's in their dna i know mine and this is so funny but when it comes to this money [Music] it's mine i got a dollar i got a dollar and you can't have it you can't have it it's all my god mine and after all what we say who else is it i'm the one that stood and punched that club i stood on my i'll work both of them jobs i'm the one that got to deal with dumb people at work no this mama listen i can show you every hour that and then for real for real they really didn't even really give me what i'm really worth anyway so this this is mine jj jim jg wentworth it's my money and i want it now oh every lit listen it's all mine and even if we don't say that with our mouth we know the action people get to talking about money i'm going to ask me for nothing ain't got nothing for you and if this is our responsibility if this is our mindset towards this you you gonna be okay i'm on a fixed income who fixed it you're thinking and you're speaking fixed i'm trying to help you all out because look at what scripture says about whose mind it is look at psalms 24 verse number one it says the earth is the lord's and everything in it the world and all its people belong to him but that ain't clear enough okay that's just what the writer psalms said but look at what god said himself in psalms 50 verse number 10 it says for all the animals of the forest are no say it with conviction don't say like you oh i'm shout no no for all the animals of the forest are what watch this and i own the cattle on the thousand hill and i know every bird on the mountains and all the animals of the field are what if i were hungry i would not tell you for all the world is and everything in it see the mind isn't wrong you just misappropriated it here's the translation those birds you see flying around mine them leaves that was blowing up and around and mine them geese that slow traffic down they annoy him but mine them diamonds you just gotta have them diamonds you love them diamonds yeah they came from my coast that was forced under pressure in the core of my earth akas them pearls you love they came from my oysters that house you so impressed with came from my wood that car that you just gotta have and you love my metal it's all mine but i'm the one working okay every time you take a breath that came from my oxygen oh who woke you up this morning you see it's all his and when we try to take ownership of something that's not ours it's called stealing okay i'm doing too much i'm doing too much y'all not ready though because we got to make it crystal clear that this don't belong to us let me give you this now give it back let me give you this now give it back you know why you're able to get that back so easy because you recognize it ain't yours and you think cause your name on that paycheck that is yours see when you realize who it belongs to god dawg it's easier to bring it back and if you don't go to verse 2 verse 2 luke 16 verse 2 and he called to him and said what is this i hear about you turn in the account of your management for you can no longer be manager when you misappropriate what doesn't belong to you it gets taken away and for some of us the reason why we have not yet gone into the next level of our finances is because we keep misappropriating this and if you don't know how to get this right you can't god don't get to the next level or you hear what i'm saying but go down to verse 10. i gotta hurry up go down to verse 10 verse 10 says but the one who is faithful and very little is also faithful and much and who is this honest and very little is also dishonest and much now here's the deal we've heard this before be faithful over a little bit rule over much most of us take this verse out of context most of us have heard this especially for like leadership stuff right like if you can sweep these floors you can run it and if you favor over a little bit be rude over much it works but that's not the scripture it's so important that you don't take stuff out of context are you hear what i'm saying because because the the the way that that is said in context he's not talking about leadership or dreams he's talking about money he's talking about stewardship of the stuff that he's giving you and what he's saying is that okay this is it's about to be mind-blowing okay so you need to act like it's mind-blowing like wow he says if you can be faithful in the little i'll make you ruler over much he's talking about finances and stewardship and management of resources and what's crazy to me is that god is actually calling this money the little thing come on wow [Applause] [Music] he's calling this the little thing and it's hard for us to read it and comprehend it because here in america we've made this the big thing we've made this the big thing okay i'm prove it to you in scripture look he says who has not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth who will entrust you with true riches here's what he's saying if you can't get this right how can i ever give you anything of substantial resource how can i ever give you any true resources if you can't get this right this is the little thing this is not the big thing this isn't how you secure the bag this isn't the thing that i want you to go after this is so small let me tell you to you this way when it comes to trusting god this is the least area of trust and you've made it the big thing your trust with god actually starts with this wow okay okay okay okay i want to make this very clear that this is not about giving to get we're not giving to get a blessing you're already blessed and not for sale anyway but you're already blessed so i'm not giving so i can be blessed no you're already the head and not the tail you're already the lender and not the bar you already have all of your needs met this is about proving to yourself that you trust god that you're my first choice even when it's difficult that i know christmas is coming but you're my first choice so i take part in the passion offering you're my first choice are you getting anything out of this okay okay okay here's what i discovered i'm like why you got doing weights on stage because here's what i discovered that as it relates to fitness nothing would challenge your trust more than lifting weights you've seen them people when they go to the gym they psych themselves up and they go let's go and they come over here they do all that psyching themselves out get all excited and be struggling have you ever seen that and it's like what in the world are you doing okay let's imagine this weight was 100 pounds all right it's 50. still kind of happy let's imagine it was on it if you came to your trainer and you said i want to lift 100 pounds well i want to lift 50 pounds what your trainer is not going to do is come over here and say all right pick this up and even if he asked you some of y'all looking at me like no because you don't trust yourself yet so there's no way you're going to lift up something that you believe is beyond your scope of trust so the trainer because you want to lift 100 or because you want to lift this 50 he's not going to start you here god dawg he's not gonna start you there instead he's gonna say let's take these five pounds and i want you to get used to lifting these five pounds because the five pounds is what's going to enable you to lift the 50. you see when we don't trust god with this [Music] but we're saying god i believe you for financial increase i believe you're going to bring me into the house of my dreams but you haven't trusted him with this you look like the person who does all that hyping up to go pick up this 50 because it doesn't work that way it's out of order it's the same people who say once i get money then i'll start tithing i make some more money i'm gonna start being generous i make some more money i'm gonna start typing no you won't no you won't no you won't why because you ain't doing it now one who is faithful with what they have the little what's in front of them and this works for anybody right because here's the deal we all start at different places so even if you start with five be faithful with that but that's your starting place and that's little see some people they get all bent out of shape because it's like well i got 200 i'm doing okay so you mean to tell me that the 200 is your little you just missed it imagine where god now trying to take you see it doesn't exclude anybody but when we don't trust him with this we've misappropriated it i'm going to give you three quick things that okay i got ten minutes i gotta give you three quick things are you getting anything out of this okay here's the first one trusting god for big things first starts with trusting him for the small when that trainer put this five pounds in your hand can i tell you something it's not about the five it's about the 50. you told him you want to lift 52. so he said okay here's what i'm gonna do we're gonna start with the five many of us don't understand that what god is giving you is the starting place in the birthplace of trust and so if you can't lift the five you'll never be able to lift the 50. what am i saying i'm saying that if he can't trust you with five dollars he'll never trust you with fifty dollars and it's not even about the money because the money is the least place of reason it's the least place to trust the way i can i really wanna say it is this if you can't trust him with this when i'm told that i'm infertile and i can't have children i won't be able to trust them to still have children because the least place of starting was my money the true riches was my son was the least place my son was the true richest but if i did not develop a relationship of trusting him with money how could i believe him for a child [Applause] are you hearing what i'm saying it's the least place it's the smallest place this ain't about even getting god to buy favor you can't buy favor either [Applause] if you could buy it it wouldn't be called favor everything that god has for you is accessed by faith but entered through trust and trust starts one step at a time it's one small act at a time that you begin to develop but the question then becomes well why does it start with our money i know that's what you guys are asking you just don't want to see it why are you guys doing without money why why why why has got to be our money because you trust god in every other area but this one if god said man if you give me this weight you feeling the blame here you go write a check well god you know i just i ain't i i can't you know i can't afford the time no you just haven't done it first you can't afford it and when people say that though oftentimes they mean it like they really mean i can't afford to tie it's because they've done everything first and then everything else first and so when they come here and they say i can't afford it it's they're not lying they just misappropriated their trust are you here what i'm telling you you're just misappropriating a trust you you've trusted that this right here can take care of you better than what god can so i'd rather pay those than give this first and if that's the system that you decide to trust in that's the system that's going to have to continually provide for you and that thing is fallible it is inconsistent it can't be trusted no no no that's why he says make me your first choice make me your priority make me the one that you put all your trust in first and when you do that i'll make sure you're empowered to have success in every area of your life never have i seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging for bread so why does he start with this my second point i gotta hurry up guys i gotta get anything out of this stuff here's my second point because if you can't be trusted to give back what's not yours how can you be trusted to give back what is yours he starts with this because it ain't yours here now give it back and you can do that because it's not yours i want to know parents have you ever like have you ever really sat down and thought about any time you're trying to build trust with your children you you start that trust off with what's yours not what's with theirs if they want like like if they first start learning how to drive you don't go out and buy them a car and say i trust you you say no you're gonna drive my car first and if you got multiple you're gonna drive the janky one first what do you say go over there and come back okay go to the grocery store come back go to the party come back go down the street come back and what are you doing it's not about the car it's about the trust i want to know can i trust you and i'm and i do that with me giving you what's mine and so here's what god says okay you take the money okay just on sunday bring the ten percent back okay okay here come the passion offering would you just show and see bring it back and what he's trying to do is can i trust you with something greater are you getting anything out of this he wants to know can you be trusted with what's not yours because if you can't bring back what's not yours how can i truly truly truly trust you to give you what it is this is this this we call good groceries and we got to get to the place guys but we understand that it's all god's it's all his anyway here's the last one god loves to be trusted i said god loves to be trusted there's nothing that will make god more proud than his children choosing to trust him when we our church just moved into a brand new building on uh easter and leading up into that we went in one situation we had more project than money anyone ever been able you got more bills than money more month than money and i remember going to god i was asking god okay god here's the deal because covey jacked up everything the price when they started is nowhere near the price when they said when they finished everything went up everything went up and i'm saying god i don't know how we're going to finish this because i see what money is left and i see how much project we got in front of us and so i went to go to pray to god i said okay god here's what i need i need some money i need you to make this happen i need to make this work and god's response was okay here's what i'm gonna do every single month i'm gonna put a pastor in your heart and you ask them a question what do you need and i said god that ain't that ain't that ain't uh yeah that that's that's not what i was coming to you for i'm asking you to give me money and you're telling me to give it away and so i called this one pastor it was on my heart i said okay okay hey man what do you need and he said well we we haven't been able to make the switch to to go into streaming every church had to go streaming for a little bit we haven't had the opportunity to do it and i said okay and so we ended up purchasing all the streaming equipment it cost us almost four thousand dollars called the financial uh person i said hey man let's put all the stuff we got let's send it to this church and then oh next month he put another passenger on my heart he said man all of our mics they were getting feedback they weren't the best quality so they were picking up the transmissions from other stuff and so we went and brought them a whole bunch of digital mics it cost us a bunch of money and i'm doing this and i'm seeing the money that we had set aside for the project dwindle but can i be honest with you it wasn't enough anyway [Music] so so i'm seeing this happen and so for five six months i'm just asking pastors what do you need what do you need what do you need and then here's what happens in in march of this year i get called by this pastor of new jersey someone that i've just been really looking up to someone that i've been following for a while he just moved into like this 60 000 square foot building getting ready to go into another 40 000 and he's got he's just walking me around sometimes you got to get around people who are listed a little further than you and and so i'm just hanging out with him talking to him long story short at the end of the day we're getting ready to leave and he says hey man i don't know why i don't even know why i'm asking you this but what do you need now i sold what do you need and now here i am reaping what do you need now the problem is that sometimes people are asking that question and you got too much pride to answer that honestly and so i told them well let's define anything that's defined me long story short because he just moved into his building he shut one of his campuses down and in that campus they had video equipment and chairs and lighting boards and sounds and he said man you can have it all you'll never outgive god [Music] and sometimes can i just i'm grossly over time i could probably talk about this for for hours but i really feel so heavy to say that i didn't say this in the first experience you will not save yourself out of debt and you will not save yourself to your next wealthy place you sow yourself there and i know there's so many different teachings on this listen i am a product of this for sure you sow yourself to where you want god to take you you don't save it and you don't withhold [Music] so the question that you're gonna have to ask yourself as i get ready to close it's simply this whose money is it anyway [Music] and do you really trust him to give back to him what doesn't even belong to you
