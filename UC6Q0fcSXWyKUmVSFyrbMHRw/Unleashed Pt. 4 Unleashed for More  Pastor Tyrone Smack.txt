[Music] thank you turn with me if you would to Exodus chapter 33. [Music] I believe God has something to say to us like he's been saying to us this Unleashed Series has been unleashing me I don't know about you I can't speak for you I'd like to speak for you because I have a mic and I would like to say that you look way better than you did coming in to this month I'm telling you coming into this year God has Unleashed something on your road has Unleashed something in your house your car think you different your car like who are you driving me I don't even know you you drive different because you're Unleashed God has done something miraculous and I think he wants to do even more went out to the tent of meeting all the people would get up and stand at the entrance of their own tents they would all watch until Moses disappeared inside verse 9 as he went into the tent the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses when the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent they would stand and Bow Down in front of their own sense inside the tent of meeting the Lord would speak to Moses face to face as one speaks to a friend afterwards Moses would return to the camp but the young man who assisted him Joshua son of none would remain behind in the tent of meeting today I want to talk to us about this title Unleashed for more Unleashed for more let's pray father we ask Lord God that you would not give us leftovers we don't want last week's you we want this week's you we want today you brand new mercies you gave us we want brand new experience we want to set brand new expectations if in today God we want to see you differently than we did before we can't even afford to have leftovers we need some more of you and so we pray king of glory fill this place give us the craving the desire to just want to be with you it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen anybody want more no no anybody want more just about your hand anybody want more you know I don't know if you guys know this but my wife and I had the privilege of having a restaurant and you know it's all my wife's recipes and stuff and so I get to assist her and I get to go over and Mia Mia where's me as Mia here Mia was able to stop by this week the restaurant I was able to give her a bit of a tour around the building and we talked and kicked it and it was awesome and good but what happens at the pickup window uh at the restaurant oftentimes people start to tell me their testimony about how good the banana pudding was oh man the banana pudding is so good and they'd be like oh and they not they're not even all the way done the banana I could talk banana pudding because 21 days in prayer in fact okay and so what happens is and so what happens is they start telling me about the turkey wings and they start telling oh my God what is your wife put it I will tell you that but I have to kill you if I tell you that what my wife puts on this our special sauce I can't tell you that and what happens is somewhere around there they start telling me I gotta get some more and if you own and you sell anything it's music to your ear cause what I do is I do this little walk right over to the register huh come on somebody I walk right over to the register because here's what I know more it's gonna cost you everybody want more until they see the tag I'm trying to tell you that God is not just giving out more you have to Crave it desirous let me show you what happened here there is something that went on in this passage Moses was at the tent of meeting and Moses would go inside and people outside would see a cloud and they knew God was there and when Moses was inside the tent he was in there face to face the Bible says talking to God like friends and he knew God was there but it was a young man the Bible says that was assisting Moses Joshua son of none he was outside the tent not for security you don't need that kind of security when you're sitting face to face with God do you you don't need that was he sitting out there and I believe when you look deeper down in the text you see Moses is setting Joshua up for successor he's setting Joshua up as a mentee that gets received from a mentor and he's keeping keep it close enough to hear the voices but not the conversations you would see it when he would go to the metal God will say don't bring nobody else with you and he Joshua with a system but he would only go as far as he could go and Moses would go to the Mountaintop and sit with God and talk for 40 days and 40 nights Joshua and they would just always say you looked at the scriptures like Joshua the assistant son of none he assisted Moses and that's and that's it and it will go away he'd be like I want to hear more about this Joshua guy and it's just it keeps writing him that way and why watch this and so Joshua when Moses is finished talking to God face to face Moses the Bible says goes back to the camp but Joshua doesn't look at what it says again in verse 11 it says inside the tent of meeting the Lord would speak face to face as as one speaks to a friend Moses would return to the camp but the young man who assisted him who helped him who was with him he stayed back Joshua son of none would return he would return behind the tent of me he would go inside and have his time I believe with the Lord Joshua wanted more when a mentor is is has a mentee there's some things that a mentor can teach you but then there's other things that you have to catch they can't they can't give you everything you have to have a one a desire but Moses I believe says he assisted him Moses delegated responsibility to Joshua and what happens with delegation when it's done properly now here's hear me and hear me clearly I don't care what work what job you do if you are a leader in your job delegation proper delegation is not giving somebody something you don't feel like doing that's called lazy leadership that's what that is I'm just sorry to tell you that's what that is it's not giving somebody some he saw what delegation is Moses did not do that what Moses did when he delegated to him Moses was trying to put him and him and one day my wife can I go back to my wife she's not here with me right now but she's here in spirit because she has some things to do God is expanding our territory right now and I just need y'all to pray for that and pray for me as I pray for your family as he is expanding because you want more you said you wanted more and so God is going to do that in your life and what happens is my wife used to work at the job I was at I was the youth pastor and my wife would work downstairs in the kitchen and she would feed 130 young people every day 150 including staff and what that was doing was teaching her how to have portion control she didn't know it at the time she was just working at the church with the kids every day and she was learning portion control the same meals that when she was feeding kids would one day turn into a restaurant later down the line but here's the thing here's the thing one day my wife had to transition out of her position she said she got a call from a friend of mine who owned a new Chick-fil-A and he said I want your wife to come run our catering department and it was an upgrade and my wife was like see y'all gotta go love you okay I'll be there in spirit and so I was like man that's that's upsetting because now all of us in the office have to go to Chick-fil-A every day to get lunch because we were just going downstairs to get lunch every day and so we had discussions about it and one day I decided to Mosey Down the same hallway that I would go to see my wife in the kitchen and I went in there and when I was getting down the down to five oh man a spoon that was the food that was coming out the kitchen ah man it smells like let me go through the door and I went through the door and I sat down I started talking to the two young ladies that were working side by side with my wife and they were sitting in the kitchen and what happened was the food came out the oven oh yeah that looks about right y'all mind if I get a little portion of that right there let me just take I need to know the youth pastor need to take so you know I need to taste it before all these kids get it I don't want these kids to get sick let me get let me get a little portion of that and when I taste it I ran back upstairs and I told everybody gee is still here my wife is still in the building because when somebody properly delegates they make sure they put them in you you don't hear what I'm saying you don't hear what I'm saying let me let me talk about my savior can I talk about our savior real quick because ours that's what our savior said let me tell you what he said real quick and watch this watch this John 16 and 7 it says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is he said I have ex it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter the holy spirit will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you yeah just just just indulge me for a moment just imagine if uh Jesus had a church right now like let's say he never died he just lived right he had a church probably in Miami I don't know he seemed like he would have a church in Miami I don't know it seems like a nice place to go right Miami he has a church in Miami I'm I'm just I'm just asking is any believer in here that will be sitting right here listening to me preach right now no you want to offend me trust me would you be listening to me preach right now if Jesus had a church in Miami you wouldn't let me answer it for you you be in Miami you'd be streaming Miami right now you would be living in Miami the Savior the one who we come for every every little day and come here concerned about he got his own church I'm moving to Miami and all the Believers around the world guess where we'll be at we be all living in Florida Jesus said I gotta go because if I if I stay it's only me right here if I stay everybody going crowd around here everybody gonna come here but if I go I can put me in each City and each state in each classroom and each office space if I go I can put me all around the world and what he says is the comforter has to come and what the comforter does is he makes you now a imitator of Jesus you know what imitation does it flatters heaven when we when we imitate God it flatters him that's what happens when my son imitates me well my son wants to do something I want when I do he wants to speak like I speak he wants to rap like he wants to do anything like I do it's flattering I'm like man this dude he really know how what you want what you say you want I don't know I'll get a part-time job for you to get that you know what I'm saying I need you I got you because the way you just did that to my heart and my you know my you stroke my ego like that I got you God said be imitators he wants us to be imitators and he said here's the thing I have left my comforter the Holy Spirit can I tell you really quick I don't know this is outside the script can I tell you about the comforter it's funny that he gives a he gives the holy spirit that name the comforter the comforter will not only make it comfortable for you when you are doing the will of God but the comforter just like the one on your bed when it's too hot you know how that comforter is on your bed when it's too hot you start kicking it ah get off me whoa I got one leg out because I'm trying to get you know I'm trying to get a mix of temperatures it's too hot with the comforter on in the summertime what happens is the comforter will sometimes make it uncomfortable the comforter has to correct that's called conviction huh conviction is just a comforter letting you know I'm making it uncomfortable you gotta get back in line that's what I do and I'm only doing it because I love you and I love you too much to leave you an error the comforter he said I'll deposit the comforter inside you so that you can be me in your office space so that you can be me in your home so that you can be me wherever you go you don't have to have a church you don't have to have a mic In a Pulpit you don't have to have that you have a word inside of you because you have the holy spirit inside of you who are the people that said they want it Morgan foreign here's the second point the second point is he prepared him that's what Moses did he prepared him he had to he had to prepare him because he can see you know leaders have a great job of seeing something in somebody like oh you know what okay I see what he doing my youth director at the time he was like uh I don't know about being a youth pastor I was like yeah this it's coming I ain't gonna force it on you but it's coming I can see it I know because I've been in your shoes before that's the that's the beauty of being compassionate compassion is putting your feet in somebody else's shoes that's why Jesus said he said he looked at the crowd he saw the crowd and had compassion on them because he understood what they were standing in do you hear what I'm saying so I understand you because I used to be you I know that's why when I get on the stage I say God make sure please that I talk to the people not from where I am but from where I've been I've been you I know what it feels like to doubt I know what it feels like to be victorious one day and then you're like where is God I don't know where he is I just seemed like yesterday he was like right here like real close to me and now today it feel like he's so far and God is like I know this is not a filling relationship it's a faith-based relationship if you wanted to be all fills you in the wrong relationship it requires faith faces and and Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 31 and 7 through 8 it says then Moses called for Joshua boom and courageous for you will lead these people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors he would give them you are the one who will divide and among them as their giant their grants I'm sorry of land do not be afraid or discouraged for the Lord will personally go ahead of you he will be with you he will never neither fail you nor abandon you saying he is reminding reminder you know this watch this watch this what he says in in Deuteronomy 34 9 he says now Joshua son of none was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands on him so the people of Israel obeyed him doing just as the Lord had commanded Moses it's something about when the leader does it publicly when he puts it on you publicly and people get begin to see but Joshua you will hear this continual theme where it's telling him to be encouraged be encouraged man I'm I'm telling you God is going to be with be encouraged Moses is is preparing him as a as a matter of fact earlier in that same passage Moses says I'm 120 years old they was like Moses is never going that Moses can't die this is not a thing can Moses really die they don't know no as long as Moses is here I'm good you know how it is as long as this you know as long as a certain leader is here we good I don't have to do the prayer call because he gonna do it I don't have to do this because he's going to do it I don't have to do none of those things I don't have to push myself because Moses going to do it Moses had an expiration date Moses had to get out though Moses said I'm 120 years old now you all that's all that assisting me all that watching me move back and forth all that seeing me spend time with God it's your time have you ever have you ever noticed that that when I know because the pressure I feel I'm I'm sure the room fills it have you under realized that when you are closest to something it intensifies do you do you feel that like you feel like there's some people right now like you feel like the weight of the world is on you and you don't know why you're like I was just fasting oh my goodness like this is supposed to be a high for me why does it feel like I'm so weighty because you want more and when you want more there's a weight that comes on they that wait upon the Lord It's funny like watch this listen they just wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength it's funny that when you think about wait no matter how you spell weight if both of them have to do with strength see see waiting when you waiting in the gym because there's a lot of people right now around this town trust me I used to work at a gym I know in January it's easy to sign people up in January at the gym easy easy I can stand I'm like oh hey hey I got 50 people to sign up today it's easy I don't have to call nobody I do no dry calls I have to go out on the street with a sign I have to do nothing because everybody in January is trying to get out of shape into sheep you hear what I'm saying they was in a in a shape and now they're trying to get insurance okay anyway and so what happened is they come running to the gym and what happens and what this is what happens if the gym knows this if you can keep a person especially y'all don't know this back door don't if any gyms are watching me praise God and so what happens is if if I signed you up with your card this is what happens this is the loophole if I signed you up on your card for a membership the the gym after three months if I kept you as a member your your bank would pay the lifespan of your gym membership off if I signed you up with a card very deceptive that's why I left but um that's another story for another day but what happens is here's the thing here's the thing people would just come and they would come and you knew if you know anything about the nature of man you know how this story goes you know that it's people sitting right now under the sound of my voice that have gym membership tags on their keys and ain't been to the gym all year but the thing about the gym is see when you go to a sneaker store and you buy a pair of sneakers you leave with a pair of sneakers when you go to the gym you don't leave what you don't you're like oh I just bought these abs they was 19.99 a month no you don't you don't you don't you don't get that what you notice is when people start dealing with the weight when they start going to the gym and they start dealing you know you know what it feels like when you're all the minute here probably the women too but all the men are here no because we go in there we go hard as soon as we get there we go straight at it you know I ain't been here in a while you start talking up I don't know what you watched on YouTube before you got you start chalking your hands and you start getting that weight and you say you know put a little put 25 more on both ends yeah then how much the bar okay I need to make sure I tell them how much I bench president and when you start lifting the weight you realize that right under here right under your unarms you know that part right there when you start seeing dudes walking around like they got a hanger in their shirt you'll be like yeah I'm cool with the general yeah I think it's gonna be late day the rest of the next week because right here I I haven't put deodorant on in like two months because my arms right here is hurting and I don't know when they in that pain that pain if you talk to people that pain is the thing that keeps people from the weight it's the pain if I can get people to get past that that was my job every day I just got to get you to keep coming to get to make sure that this pain is just your starting point when my son is doing push-ups he'll be like intend and I'll be like no no that's where you start that's one that's one right there I'm telling you well it feels like your arms are weak that's your starting point that's not your ending point they and wait ing is painful If we're honest if we're on our honest waiting is painful especially in our DNA why I'm preaching I can open a hat and I can order me some food that can be here as soon as I finish my message and everyone say in it but everybody come on God Steve Jobs made an app for that you need to come on and hurry up with your stuff you got me waiting for Stuff Guy where I can get it right now I need it right now God and God is like no to you right now because nobody will give me Glory if I give it to you right now there's there's a man that's that's I told the Dream Team this there's a man I didn't even let the Dream Team go I'm tripping I didn't let them go when I was starting my well sorry y'all can we start from the top I'll come back out no and so what happens is the I chose the Dream Team I was watching the History Channel and the dude was making a sword and he had on the fire suit and all that in there you know you're chilling but you want to hear from God and everything and so I'm just chilling I'm chilling and I'm watching The History Channel I don't know why I was but I was and so I'm watching it and it's dude it's my sword and what happens is they ask this guy a question they said when do you know it's time to bring the sword out the fire and the guy said this this what he said watch this he said I know it's time to bring it out the fire when I see my reflection in it and I said wow and God said yeah that waiting thing you're gonna wait until I see my reflection you're gonna wait cause I'm trying to see me not you I know I know it's counter-cultural this ain't we're not doing Earth culture we doing Kingdom culture and God said I need to see me not you you you you you you you you knock you the apple of my eye but I'm the tree I'm the guardian come on man don't don't look I'm a whole thing no don't I'm all that and a baggage as a matter of fact he's so good that in the beginning when he was creating stuff and the Bible says he stepped back and said well you all are in the bags here you see what you did there you all that he don't need nobody to give him praise he's so good at it himself he said but I need to see me and you and so Moses takes the time and he does that he puts himself in Joshua oh man my time is going faster and faster and faster and so the third point oh God the third one can I go straight to the third point I I want to I want to talk to you if you can you you got to pick this up I'm gonna read it really as fast as I can go to Joshua 1 Joshua 1. Joshua 1 because this is where God starts talking to Joshua this is what God starts talking to Joshua watch this he says after the death of Moses the Lord's servant the Lord spoke to Joshua son of none Moses assistant there it is again he said Moses my servant is dead he's dead now is it he's gone he says no more Moses watch this Moses my servant is dead therefore the time has come for you to lead these people the Israelites across the Jordan River into the land I gave them I promise you what I promised Moses whatever wherever you set foot you will be on land I have given you from the Wilderness and the south of the Lebanon Mountains and the north of the Euphrates River and the east of the Mediterranean Sea in the west including all the land of the Hittites no one will be able to stand against you as long as you live for I will be with you and and so you can see I want y'all to read it I I listen I want to go through the whole thing but he keeps saying and then he starts to say look to watch this watch this in verse in verse verse six it says be strong and courageous for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them verse 7 be strong and very courageous and what you need to see is it's this thing where God and His and Moses the two are saying the same to Joshua they're saying the same thing that you need you need a mentor that is going to say the same thing to you that God is trying to say to you [Music] watch this and watch this Moses Moses is obviously not courageous because Moses and God keep saying the same thing as a matter of fact if you go to Joshua chapter four not right now but if you go there you'll see this moment where Joshua he gets to he gets to the Jordan River and now he has these people who are mourning Moses this Moses they Moses was great in the scriptures like people talked about Moses great I mean Moses had his issues and people gave you know Moses is running around and they they gave him a whole bunch of headaches you know how people get when there's that many people behind you but what happens is Moses was talked about very greatly and Joshua gets to this Jordan River and you can imagine he hears all the stories going on about behind him yeah when Moses was here oh my goodness when Moses was here Moses would do this Moses would raise hand and we would win good guess girl and I mean and guess what my grandma was telling me this one time he went to the Red Sea and it split oh my goodness and here's Joshua standing at this Jordan River and and Joshua was like and it ain't working it ain't working come on come on you said you be with me it ain't working and I believe God was like what's not working Joshua the way you did it did it you trying to see the same stuff your leaders before you saw he ain't trying to do it that way with you he got something different so what you got to do is you got to get your feet a little way you got to go out and he goes out and right in the middle of it I said career wrote a song in the middle of it and now it makes sense to me where God showed up right in the middle of the Jordan River he showed up and Joshua was able to see him in his own way can I go can I close right here I got to I got to because I don't have time here's the thing he watches God reminds you God was reminding him look I did it for I did this with Moses and I promise you I'll be with you I got you be courageous as a matter of fact you know next door be very courageous I got you I'm telling you I'm for you I'm not again nobody wherever you put your feet it's gonna be people that come up against you they're not gonna like you if you're worried about being like this a leader you're not ready to be a leader I'm telling you it's going to be critical it's gonna be crucial the things the decisions you have to make it's people that's not going to care for on your team that are not going to care for the decisions you make you have to make the decisions that God said make and watch this Joshua 5 13 and 15 it says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and he looked and behold a man stood opposite of him and his with a sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went up to him and said are you with us or you're with our adversaries sure the commander of the army of the Lord said no and some translations it says neither wait wait that wasn't that wasn't the option on the table I said are you with them or are you with us neither hold on wait hold on say that again oh you say you was with neither hold on hold on and the Bible says when Joshua heard the commander of the army of the Lord he bowed watch this watch this his face to the Earth and he worshiped and said to him what does my Lord say to his servant watch this what can make a worshiper worship that voice you know that voice right that voice you that voice it don't it doesn't stray far from the scriptures because God is his word and whatever he says in his word you can go back and reference it and says yep that's that was a that was a God moment but what happens is this is a theophany this is where God manifests himself in another form oh you remember right you remember earlier you remember when the people saw the cloud they knew God was there remember when Moses would go into the tent he knew God was there there was this time where God changing his form and gonna PM this week and I said this I said the reason God changes his form is so we don't develop a formula of us a formula oh just Add Water that's all it takes that's all I need in my Christian give me one of that give me the Christian experience where I can just Add Water and I'll take it and then the commander of the Lord's army he said this take off your sandals take off your shoes for the place where you stand is Holy shoes we use to equip us to walk through rough terrains [Music] can't go through this neighborhood if I was in Jamaica on the sand beaches now I can take my shoes off in Jamaica on a sand beach I can do that but I can't walk through broken glass [Music] needles I can't where's my shoes I need I need my shoes to put on my feet and God says listen take your shoes off why are you asking for my shoes because your shoes protect you from rough stuff but that's why I'm here I'm here to show you like I said I'm with you even in the rough terrains I'm with you even when it's hard I got you listen I believe even when you look at the armor of God because when you look at the shoes in the armor of God it spoke of the P it spoke of the peace the gospel of peace and if you want if you do a study on the shoes that the soldiers will wear when it comes to the armor it wasn't just Spiritual armor it was an actual armor what they would use it was a shoe kind of similar to a clique like a football cleat and if you know anything about football you know they play in all different types of elements sometimes they play on gastro Turf sometimes they play in Grass sometimes it's raining on grass sometimes it's snowy outside but you know what you can use the same cleats or every type of situation you gotta have and okay God says take off your shoes I got you now [Music] to protect you I said I'd be with you you don't need a formula you don't need that throw away all the things that are so so so natural to you where you find your comfort I am your comforter
