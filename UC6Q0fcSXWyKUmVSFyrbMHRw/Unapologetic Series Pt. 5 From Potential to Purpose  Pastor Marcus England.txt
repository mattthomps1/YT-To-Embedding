[Music] so we're gonna jump into the book of first corinthians chapter two and we're talking about the presence of the lord somebody say the presence of the lord presence of the lord the presence of the lord i need the presence of the lord i need the presence of the lord i have to have the presence of the lord i must have the presence of the lord i cannot deal with life without the presence of the lord i need the holy spirit ruling and abiding in my life i need it pastor why are you talking about this holy spirit who is he he is the very comforter that was promised to god's people those in whom gave their life the bible says and i shall sing you a comforter of the holy spirit and this holy spirit we're going to learn today is here to do in you what you cannot do of your self [Music] first corinthians chapter 2 starting at verse 11 and it reads for who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person which is in him so also no one comprehends the thoughts of god except the spirit of god i want you to get that that's important to underline no one it says no one comprehends the thoughts of god except the spirit of god now we have received the spirit not of the world but the spirit who is from god that we might understand the things freely somebody say free given to us by god it says and we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual it breaks down very clearly it says this the natural person does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are folly to him and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned it says the spiritual person judges all things but is himself to be judged by no one for who has understood the mind of the lord so as to instruct him but this last part says but we have the mind of christ but we have the mind of christ i want to come from the topic this morning from potential to purpose from potential to purpose let's pray father in the name of jesus we're declaring and believing by your spirit and your presence today that what you want to do in this place is to speak life and that life more abundantly i pray that we would not just be hearers in this moment of your word but that we would also be doers for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians and can you help me celebrate our volunteers our dream team that's making uh today happy y'all help me celebrate them real quick today i i want to talk about the idea from potential to purpose and i think it is befitting that i would uh bring up the subject matter that has been taking pl place all week which we know we've all been talking about it or we've seen it or we've had an opportunity to gaze over it but you know what it is it's it's it's the oscars the oscars and and if you don't know what has happened then i'm gonna ask you to go in and research real quick because you would have to be hidden under a rock not to know what is taking place on monday morning i i woke up to a flooded social media of one thing and one thing only and that was the events that happened within the oscars now some events went to the place to talk about who won and and and and went to talk about who had great achievements and talked about uh who won some amazing awards but the truth of the matter is the only thing that we will remember from the oscars of 2022 will be the slap from will smith to the face of chris rock you can tell me you watched it through you can tell me how impactful it was to see the others win but the only thing that will rest on your mind is that slap you have seen that slap with uh commentary behind it you have seen that slap with music behind it you've seen it in slow motion fast motion you've seen people have full panels on this talk you have seen people give their opinion and their idea on it about this talk but the problem is is that we have not heard from the slapper and the one being slapped and while we all have an opinion because that's what we live for is an opinion while we all have an opinion can can i say this to you today no one truly knows the reason the understanding and the spirit of why will smith did what he did you can have your opinion on if it was right you can have your opinion on if it was wrong you can have your opinion on whether you think you would have done it you can have your opinion on try jesus just not me because you throw hands because god's still working on you you could be that person but what i want to tell you today is no one knows the spirit but the person in whom the actions came out of can i tell you today no matter how much we think we know we never really know the spirit of why someone has done something until they let us know as much as they're willing to give us information for you don't know everything about you you don't can i tell y'all you don't know even everything about your mate listen i i want to tell you something you know them but you don't know them because let me tell you if you know them you know them on a good day and most of us try to know the people that were in relationship on a good day but the problem is is that on a bad day you see a side that you weren't meaning to see some of you you're saying well pastor i don't know about that i'm not married here's what i want to let you know there is a side of you inside of your car that nobody hears or knows about but i promise you the way that you are giving it out to the person in front of you or behind you or on the side of you there is something that they don't know about the spirit of you the bible lets us know for the for no one really knows the thoughts except the spirit of the person the spirit of the person the bible lets us know that there's something about the spirit of an individual there's something about the spirit of a person that drives them to the place of understanding who they are and who god has created them to be there there's something about the spirit of a person that lets you know why they move forward the way they do or why they hold back to the way that they do and and the spirit of the person gives you an indication of what's happening internally on the inside of people it's the spirit of a man it's the spirit of a woman but i'm i'm here today to let you know is that the spirit of this world is broken the spirit of this world is not the initial spirit that god called us to the bible lets us know in genesis that when he created man and when he created woman he had created a perfect creation that in its creation it was always to operate under the authority of the kingdom of heaven can i tell you today that earth is supposed to reflect heaven and there's supposed to be a reflection between the two but here's where the problem came in is that sin entered into this world and when sin entered into this world sin started to make the decision that it can operate without god and where we've landed at in life is that we have started to believe the world and what it says that we can operate at an autonomy outside of what god says based on how we feel based on what we think based on our opinion based on the thoughts that we have and the lord says you were never supposed to operate outside of me i'ma hit this subject today because in order to get the presence of god in we've got to get the presence of someone else out so we're going to take time with this today because there's something that must be integrated in our spirits and there's something that must be opened up in our minds because the perspective of where we are is that we are still sometimes in the same place we were two and three years ago operating out of the same potential that has not turned into purpose any of us would get frustrated with the seed that has been planted in the seed that has been planted that finds itself in a place where it's not growing we're going to ask the question what is keeping the seed from growing to where it's supposed to be is there some malnutrition is there something that's not being watered is it not getting enough sun but we understand where there is a lack of growth that means there's a lack of resource and where there's a lack of course there's a lack of resource and where there's a lack of resource there's a lack of maturity somebody say maturity i cannot grow in god if i don't have the ability to mature in him why is that so important because what we're understanding is is there's this must be something that opens the gateway the door the possibility the clarity to understanding that god wants me to grow but how am i supposed to grow am i just supposed to come to church and grow am i supposed to just attend sunday school and grow am i supposed to just be here and the bible lets us know that your growth is not just coming out of your doing it's coming out of the spirit that's growing on the inside of you it says there's something up with the spirit of a man sometimes you ever seen people that kind of go back and forth in their attitude in the way that they are and you're trying to figure out what's regulating you and most of the time what regulates us is our emotional state not our spiritual state and because we're emotionally challenged you don't want to admit that but we are because you're emotionally challenged because your feelings are up and down side to side and you're always trying to bring it together you're trying to figure out how do i maintain a mindset and a spirit to be able to say somebody say this word with me say consistent oh my god consistency is one of our greatest struggles it's one of our greatest struggles to wake up in the morning at the same time every day it is one of our inconsistencies that we find ourselves grabbing stuff in the fridge when we said we were on a diet we weren't eating no sugar when we said we weren't gonna go that way it is our inconsistencies that put us back outside of the purpose back to the seed of potential and the seed of potential looks good but the problem is you need more of a seed to do something than to stay where it is you need a seed to be able to grow and if a seed doesn't grow then it means there's something wrong with the seed and here's what i want to let you know is that everything on the inside of you has been planted by god so there's nothing wrong with the seed there's something wrong with the resource oh god we're gonna open this thing up because i need you to get the clarity and understand what the bible is speaking about is there something about the spirit of a man not a man's church attendance not how much you opt out of living for god in your own way not how much music you listen to that's christian it's something about the spirit of a man on the inside that regulates the things they do and don't do it regulates your passion for god it regulates where your mind is today it regulates the spirit of what you're moving out of we act like it's everything around us but it's the spirit on the inside that's why we see what happened at the oscars happen is because there's something going on with the spirit of the man it's the spirit we need to understand the clarity of what god's spirit is trying to do on the inside of us and the bible says there's something about when we enter if you have if you're at a place and you're saying well what about the spirit it's something about when you enter into the place of salvation and you've accepted jesus that he does not want to leave you in a state where you have eternity but you live in brokenness because your spirit is being challenged the question is not how much better can you do on the outside it's about the spirit of who you are changing somebody say on the inside see the reason cycles take place is because oftentimes the weeds that come to grab and choke the seed are the weeds that keep the potential from moving into the purpose and we love the idea of potential now let's not get it wrong i'm not going to talk to my single people but i'm going to talk to my single people because oftentimes we love to be able to introduce people with their potential hey i want you to meet ron ron here has the potential he's about to graduate he's about to buy a house he's about to go forward he's about to get a job when will about be an actual thing because what i don't need you to do is sell me on what's about to happen i need you to sell me on what happens don't set me up you ever you ever have somebody trying to invite them to something i promise you it's going to be good we about to move we're about to tell somebody you even like i i want you to know about how about you just invite me when you do because what's happening in the potential phase is that you're trying to create an image for people to see for the things you have yet made a decision to do why is this so good because you would stop making false promises about who you're going to be and just become the product of what you are so no longer do we have to talk out of what you could do we're talking out of what you are doing i'm going to save no just save let's tell your neighbor real quick won't you just do it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah tell your spouse won't you just do it listen if if i could push you a little bit today it's gonna make a little bit uncomfortable that project that you said you was gonna take care of at the house can you just do it i don't need to hear no more about it can you just make it happen that thing you said you were gonna handle can you just do it we don't need to talk about it we don't need to text about it we don't need to put that thing in somewhere else can you just do it that degree you say you're going to get can we just do it and can we stop living life out of a potential state of mind we want to live life greater than in the spirit of potential i want you to live somebody say in purpose i want you to live in purpose but the problem with trying to live in purpose that's going to require consistency for you to do something that's outside of the norm of what you normally do that's why we keep landing at the same place we keep landing so the bible lets us know something has to change well what can change us what has the ability to grab ahold of us in moments where we don't have the ability to muster up enough strength to do it of ourselves scripture lets me know that there is something that god has made available to me there is something in scripture that god says he's he's made as a gift to me it is free it is it's been freely given it is a product of salvation it is a product of me being saved it is a product of me giving my heart to god not a product of me coming to church it is a product of my somebody say salvation am i giving my life over to jesus christ it is the product of this what is the product he says i offer you this gift what is this gift this gift is the gift of the holy spirit when i give this gift of the holy spirit it will give you space to enter into a realm of possibilities beyond what you could imagine or think that's when scripture starts to grab at you to say exceeding and abundantly and above all things that no mind can conceive things that no eye has seen things that no ear has heard why doesn't this make sense to me because the bible says unless you understand the spiritual things this will not make sense to you you'll never comprehend that's why as a pastor i understand when people are looking at me sometimes like a deer and headlights because the spirit man is not connecting with the spiritual word and the natural man is looking for things to appease the flesh but the bible says in order to get this thing something has to change and turn on the inside of you and it is the spirit of god here's the thing if you don't have the spirit then there's something that's not going to make sense and when i say things like exceeding and abundantly you say not so i'll stay where i at i'll be comfortable but god is saying if you've got the spirit on the inside of you i can activate and motivate and change your very life [Applause] but it's all about the spirit it's not okay just to leave you at the point of salvation because your salvation will bore you [Music] so many christians are bored in their salvation because they have not moved to the next step of what god is speaking for them to do in their life so they blame it on god they blame it on church they blame it on people but they don't understand that they had lacked a comprehension to the things of god so there is nothing else to dig into because i've hit a wall that's why our greatest goal is money our greatest goal is money because the only thing that money requires you to do is just be greedier and greedier it requires nothing from you it doesn't require you to change it doesn't require you to be focused in anything it doesn't require there to be anything that you sacrifice it just requires you to go after it with everything you got and the bible warns us what will you make the decision to serve who will you serve the spirit of mammon or will you serve god they say you can't have two masters you'll either love one and hate hate the other you don't hate god but you're not interested in them it's just not interested man you want to open the word not really interested you want to get in a group nah not really interested why because i gotta be out here i gotta grind i gotta grunt it's easier to go after money than to go after god all you got to do is sign up for ot i want some more hours but the word of god is going to require you to let go of something to release something it's going to require you to sacrifice something it's going to require you to dig a little deeper it's gonna require you to sacrifice your pride it's gonna require you to sacrifice how much you think you are it's gonna require you to sacrifice that even though i got some money i'm still jacked up broken messed up in my head got past issues i haven't got over healing that i haven't gotten through that's what it'll do it says don't worry about fixing anything else in your life just keep pursuing me and i'll fix it all with what you can buy and the problem is is you've got everything you want but the problem is you're still broken five bedrooms broken two cars broken [Music] and you keep figuring out what else can i do where else can i invest what else can i put into that's going to get me to the place i need to go to and god says you will never be satisfied because the problem is is that you don't understand your purpose and your purpose is unlocked through the one who gave it to you and the only way you unlock purpose is through the creator but the only way to get clarity and what the creator says is to hear from the creator how do i hear from the creator the bible says the only person that has an access to the mind of god is the holy spirit [Applause] that's why it makes it hard when you come to me to say god has said something but the problem is you haven't been in connection with the holy spirit how did god tell you if there's no spirit to confirm what the spirit of god is saying because the bible says the only person who knows the heart and mind of god is the spirit of god so without the spirit i don't have the clarity i am guessing i am throwing lots i am rolling dice with my life unless the spirit gives me access the only person that can know the mind of god is the spirit of god spirit of god a part of the trinity god the father god the son god the holy spirit there's only three in the group you can't enter into the group because you just won't hang out the lord spoke to me so you heard from the holy spirit because the holy spirit is the one who found out from god don't let them people fool you let folks try to tell you what's happening with now that doesn't make sense that's not scripture it doesn't make sense don't come together you can't you can't make this up but here's the thing you can be confident about what god is speaking in your life how to hear the spirit of god pastor what do i need i need to ask the lord lord allow your holy spirit to operate in my life freely so that i can hear what he is saying to me so that i know it is of your will not of your opinion not of your feelings not of your broken past not of your boundaries not of your barriers not of your borders that you put up because the spirit of the lord said so [Music] the bible lets us know the spirit of the lord has been in the picture the whole game old testament presence of the lord comes in and manifests itself in in in the temple and and it is visible and the glory of god is just walking around because some of us would say lord if you could just tell me how many of us have said that if you could just tell me i would be good can i tell you he tried that whole group of people i'm in the temple i'm on the earth i got fire in the sky as a pillar cloud by day and by night i'm taking you through red seas you're seeing whales and fish on the side of you there is food falling from heaven i'm doing miracles he's like i tried it i promise you you still don't listen he says i see my son jesus how about we do that send jesus that should get their attention jesus gets on the scene i said can anything good come from nazareth can any that no possible way that this is the son of god oh my no the joseph son no way jesus was on earth walking with men and they walked right past him and said nope can't be that's not him it's not the way he's supposed to come he said all right i'll try it again i gotta get out of here cause these people are wearing me out i died out and rose from the grave they still don't believe me it's look at us in the holy spirit and it won't just be for a certain group of people small group of people it's going to be for everybody so my spirit can go in every individual person and whom accepts me and he says and when that spirit goes it'll be a free gift somebody say free free gift given to them and when that free gift is given to them i promise you there's something that's going to change on the inside of them that's going to manifest and we talked about this last week when the spirit of god came into peter the bible says he began to speak only one message and that one message saved 3 000 people and changed their life here's the thing the holy spirit is ready to take your potential to purpose if you will allow them but the problem is it's just like back in the old testament just like when jesus was here and as the holy spirit is here if we do not allow the holy spirit to transform our lives and change us into who we are called to be we will always live out a potential and never out of purpose and i'm here today to let you know that what god is trying to do is move you from a potential life to a purposeful life why is that so important because if not you get yourself stuck in a place where you keep convincing you that you're okay and the problem is as smart as you are you know you're not okay you go and rest with yourself and here's what happened the spirit within you is at an unrest now you know how to override everybody we know how you know y'all know how over you know you made that commitment no snacks in the house i'm not eating no sugar i'm not eating after eight o'clock everybody's got that one promise we will not eat late it's 10 o'clock you talking about where you want to go just real quick just tonight not not every other night just tonight we gonna do this we know how to override what we have already said with ourselves because we're good at personal negotiations negotiations means i'll put things inside so tomorrow what i'm not going to do since i'm going to eat this tonight tomorrow i'm not going to eat and we start this negotiating process with ourselves okay so if i don't do that then i'll do that and then when i don't do it i'll come back and i'll make sure and so i won't eat all day so now you have no nutritional state you shaking in your knees because what you think and you're negotiating was good is that because you ate the burger last night for some reason it's going to burn off when it and when you don't eat in the day mysteriously and the burger is sitting there looking at you saying no i'm still here and you hungry because we love to negotiate when we get uncomfortable and purpose will make you uncomfortable potential will keep you where you are you know i could you know i might you know i should you know i it's a good idea but the problem is the holy spirit is trying to get your attention on the inside to say that i'm trying to do something greater than keep convincing you of your potential i'm trying to take your potential to a sense of purpose and god is saying i want to do it but it's only if you will allow me to here's here here's where i i i want to i want to help us because for those of us that are saved those of you that are online love you as we move out of salvation into growth and maturity the process of what god wants to do in us is to develop us into who he call for us to be every seed of who you're called to be is already on the inside of you you do not have to ask for it you do not have to pray for it it is there it was created it won't be deposited later it's already there so what i want to get you to understand is what you're praying for is not about god placing it or sowing it you're asking god to allow for it to actually grow you need it to move from potential to purpose here's why i want to let you know because what you don't get is that you're already free [Music] but if the seed of freedom does not grow from the potential of freedom to the purpose of freedom you'll stay right where you are even though freedom is already on the inside of you the bible lets us know if you know the truth the truth will do what set you free if you've got truth you've got freedom he's already given it to you so it's not something that he has to deposit on the inside of you it's something that's already included in the package see you came with a package deal you didn't come with with the basic model you aren't the basic model of what god built the bible lets us know in ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 it says you are a masterpiece created in christ jesus to do some really good works so everything that god has placed on the inside of you is seed on the inside of you the problem is is that you need the holy spirit to come to move that seat from a place of potential to a place of purpose somebody say purpose in understanding that now i need to allow the holy spirit to enter in my life to reveal things that your mind cannot understand as smart and as witty and as good as you think you are you are actually way below the average of god's thinking without the spirit of god your intelligence does not compare to what god wants to do and what he wants to show you in your life he wants to open up things that no eyes see that no mind can even conceive that no i'm just trying to tell you there's greatness inside of you but if you don't have the holy spirit to unlock it you will stay in the state that you're in you'll make great strides in your job but you'll still be empty inwardly with who you are there's potential in you for freedom there's potential in you for peace there's potential in you for generosity you don't have to ask to be generous generosity is already in you barbara lets us know it's more blessed to give than to what well if aliyah just said it we always have potential seed it's what we do with the potential seed to bring purpose because you'll quote every phrase possible but the problem is a quoted phrase is not moved into a faith action yeah like it's more blessed to give receive it's like that's the truth the truth that's supposed to set you free don't be arrogant in bible quoting when you're not doing [Music] because because we love to cast awesome scripts you know what i'm talking about like we love show people because you know what the bible says let's not talk about what it says let's talk about what you're doing because there's two differences from what it says and how you're living and the context of how you're living doesn't always match what you're saying so the truth will set you free well i'm stuck because you won't take the truth and apply it to your life and don't get the freedom that's already a seed inside of you that you don't have to ask for it's in you everything that you're thinking that god has given you vision for you already have everything you need to achieve it everything everything somebody say everything everything that god has given you vision for you have the potential inside of you to achieve it you don't have to ask for it it's there somebody say it's there you have to allow the holy spirit to speak into you to allow that seed to manifest from potential to the place of purpose some of us are praying god help me to be generous no no no the idea is god unlock my generosity what we need god to do is unlock what's already in us not manifest it as a new creation when god created you he created you with everything you need this is not an add-on package this is not something you'll get later in the term everything you need is on the inside of you somebody say now [Music] but you have to be able to unlock it so as we're in this series unapologetically moving from potential we're talking about moving to purpose the idea of moving from potential moving to the place of purpose means there's something that i've got to be doing in my spirit in my mind in the way that i live that has to be outside of sundays that are going to grow me to the place that i can see the manifest presence of god in my life and everything that i know is potential moves to purpose the first thing that i need to understand is that i must have fuel i must feel spiritual desire you've got to feel spiritual desire you've got to feel spiritual desire i just don't be feeling like it you gotta feel spiritual desire the question is what are you desiring can i tell you how we start to desire we start to intake it a whole lot you you start to intake it you start to make this a part of your life you start to bring it in anybody started a water journey and you just got on and you just like man i'll drink water forever i just love water you didn't love no water before you had to build it you had to feel it can i tell you the things of god won't come natural you will fall asleep on it you will zone out on it you will make this thing something else and just be like i only feel like it today that's because your spiritual desire is bankrupt your spiritual desire does not come out of just being saved ask somebody beside you be like you've been saying for 10 years you still love jesus yes i mean yeah i love them you know they start going into it i love them then you'll be like but what i mean i love them you know unless you feel the desire that's inside of you you'll stay where you are let's read scripture scripture says in hebrews chapter 3 verse 13 through 14 you must encourage somebody saying carriage you must encourage one another each day some of y'all don't talk to people for like two weeks no i just you know i don't have that kind of time that's the reason you're struggling because you can't be encouraged it says each day be encouraged spiritually i don't do people and and maybe everybody don't necessarily want to do you but you need encouragement you need spiritual encouragement daily it says and you must keep on while there is still time that can be called today it says if you don't then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn it's it's when you come to church like you're doing people favors you know i came because of you i didn't ask you to come at all you know i'm here to support you no no you're here because you need transformation [Applause] that's that's why you're here today you you need transformation on the inside it says if if you don't then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn and it says we were sure about christ when we first became his people it says so let's hold somebody say tightly to our faith until the end let's hold tightly to our faith to the end you got to feel it anybody know about fueling things anybody anybody know about feeling you you anybody in here like eating healthy can i get can i see your hands if you like eating healthy tell the truth don't be making i don't even believe half of y'all no that's too many hands up um the fruit of it anyway burger king's across the street i know that's where some of y'all be going right after service jumping in that drive-through talking about double whopper with cheese and they're gonna talk about diet coke let me okay i'm not even gonna go down that road your diet coke is doing nothing but we we we feel our desires we feel the things that we want we we feel our patterns and the places and the things that we're doing we feel it with the way like this thing right here some of y'all didn't eat this morning and the way you're staring at me makes me uncomfortable now i can see some of you what's that what you got right there was it was what's over there you got you got something to eat right there and this is a a sausage egg and cheese croissant with hash browns and a coffee yeah that coffee that's where it hit some of y'all some of y'all went into a shape like it wasn't the presence of god it was another present oh coffee jesus lord help me the problem is is this can give you energy enough to fill you for a moment and it can satisfy you for a short time but the problem is is you're going to feel the effects of this grease this sausage because that little headache gonna start coming because this sausage is supposed to be sausage we pray and we've got to feel desires that are according to what our body needs not what our body wants we act too much out of what we want and not enough out of what we need and because the holy spirit said most of the time what you want is closer than what you need so we go to the things that satisfy the desire really really quickly not thinking about the after effects of what it does into our life and we say no that's not gonna fill me up that's not gonna really fill me up i need this and i need a good cup of coffee and i need a bunch of packs of sugar and cream so coffee don't even taste like coffee no more it's like a milky slushie and you're drinking it and you're hitting it and you're saying i need it because that's what an addiction to the wrong things will tell you is that you need the things that you don't actually need you just want them and the enemy is good at confusing our needs with our wants i need that car no no no you want it because if you really need it you would have done what you needed to do to be able to afford it [Music] but because i want it i'll jeopardize i'll jeopardize my future i'll jeopardize my finances i'll jeopardize my legacy i'll jeopardize everything just to get what i want and the holy spirit says i come so that in that space i can speak to you and give you clarity to what god is saying you need so you gotta fuel the desires you gotta go and and and get the bananas in and get the mangoes in and get get the fruit and and and some of you are not even looking at me no more because i stop holding hash browns and a sausage egg and cheese and i'm looking at the fruit to say this is what you need and here's what you're saying it's not enough because we want to be full but the problem is is we want to be full so much that we can't operate you gotta feel your desires my question is is what's feeling or desire you have to actually make the difference in determination that everything that is fueling your desires and not about it being sin can i say that one more time everything that is about fueling your desire is not about it being on the side of sin and nonsense it's about it being on the side of will and god's will [Music] because that's how we like to test the waters what is this sin like how far can i go with this how much can we do how much is available and god says we're out of the bucket of sin and nonsense we're not even talking that anymore with the holy spirit we're talking will and will of god so the question becomes whose will are you living out your will or god's will holy spirit says in order to even hear me you've got to fuel it what does that mean it means that everything that i can do is not feasible for me to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] you think you holier no no no i just know where i could go if i go down that road and if i go down that road i know the way i can get and i know the way i can get which leads me to a place where i'm disconnected from the holy spirit because the bible lets me know when i sin against god and here's where i want you to get clarity sinning against god is not about trying to find the sin in the bible that says right and wrong it's sin is when i go against god's will the bible says the wages of sin is death some of us are disobedience to god's will not to what you found that you could read in the bible to give you clarity or to clear you because we go to the bible to clear us i'm here today to let you know it's that he's saying no i just want to know do you know my will and my will will show you what to do point number two is that you've got to create spiritual environments you got to create a spiritual environment what's a spiritual environment it's a place where you can be within the presence of god pastor you don't know where i live you don't know where i go you don't know who i'm living with you don't know the place that i got to stay you don't know the things that surround me really really quick i want to let you know that david got a really good understanding and he said this in psalms 91-1 he said he who dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty it's not about everything around me being ordered it's about what's inside of me being in order if god is on the inside of my spirit everything else i can block away i can walk through things and say you know what it doesn't faze me anymore why because i'm not struggling in that area because i'm in what my secret place you don't know how to get into your secret place until you take time with the holy spirit and the holy spirit gives you everything you need to be able to abide in him scripture lets us know in first corinthians it lets us know in 619 it says you surely know that your body is the temple where the holy spirit lives it says the spirit is in you and is a gift from god you are no longer your owner you are no longer your own you got to create an environment how do i create an environment i create a place where god's people can be around me and still know that i'm around me even though i'm at work and at work they'd be tripping y'all know they'd be tripping at work y'all they'd be tripping real hard at work you'd be trying to go to work like oh my god i to take the presence of the lord take the presence of the lord not the presence of some sage [Applause] because let me tell you the devil ain't scared of no smoke the devil ain't scared of the rocks unless the lord made them cry out i just want to free y'all from some stuff that y'all think is blocking the enemy and i'm trying to tell you you can burn all the sage you want you can have all the healing stones you want you can say all the mantras you want if it ain't got the holy spirit the devil is looking at you saying god i know but you i don't know you need the holy spirit to create the environment so that you stop waiting on the zin and the energy i can feel it in this space i walk into the space the energy is off how the heck can you measure energy what are you doing the energy of what what spirit are you measuring because you're not measuring energy you're measuring spirits i'll be carrying y'all like it's this after just coming out of kobe i don't care what you think you know what i mean charles i'ma talk about it stop burning them incense unless you like them because they smell good cause they ain't weaning off nothing so burn that sage because it's not getting you free from nobody no ghosts no nothing stop wearing them healing stones because they ain't healing a darn thing in your body when you keep eating that food like you are anyway it's making up stuff and we're doing too much to try to find remedies for what the holy spirit is supposed to be doing in our lives because we like being spiritual people we just don't like having the spirit move on pastor point number three to move from potential to purpose you're called to produce spiritual fruit the bible lets us know that the result of time with the holy spirit is that the fruit that you produce will be spiritual fruit that is reflective of your relationship with him that's why you never have to argue with people about where they are with god because the lord lets us know the result of your time with god is the fruit that you bear it's your fruit somebody say it's my fruit yeah you don't have to get offended you have to get mad at people somebody tried to tell you asia you ain't on the right road you know i know the fruit i'm bearing it's about your fruit the question is what what does your fruit look like because he told us in genesis be fruitful and multiply god has given us our own ability to evaluate where we are with him that's why he lets us know there's conviction but there's no condemnation the holy spirit brings conviction it does not bring condemnation but here's what the bible lets us know is that without the holy spirit we don't understand spiritual matters god is moving beyond the idea of his church being good people god is moving beyond the idea of his church being people that do good things god is with the idea that his church is powerful he said and when you receive the holy spirit you shall have power you say good feelings he didn't say a calm way of thinking he didn't say he's just gonna have a level-headed way of operating he said you shall have power the same power that raised jesus from the dead he says shall be in you you're settling for a peaceful environment god says i called you to disrupt environments i called you to call out satan right where he is i called you to lay hands on people and they be healed he said i called you to be a church with power not a church with good ideas not a church that makes people feel better he said i called you to be a church with power that when we walk past and i pray for you there's healing today there's deliverance today there's freedom in the name of jesus today i want to be in a church where the power of god's presence is not where good people want to feel good pastor i'm gonna come to you why because i know there's power there i have more in this life to exceed in the exceeding of good energy and good space and good vibes those are feelings that emotionally change based upon the condition of where we are in life stop being a conditional human stop living conditional lives stop living out your potential in conditional ways because you feel it today but you don't feel it tomorrow the holy spirit says i've come to ground you i've come to make you consistent i've come to help you live out your purpose and the plan so tomorrow you're not losing it and slapping somebody and today you're trying to act like god is fully with you no you've got to understand god bears fruit and the fruit of it is good fruit the bible says in john chapter 15 verse 5 he says yes i am the vine and you are the branches whoever lives in me and i in him shall produce a large crop of fruit and he says for apart from me you can do nothing [Music] i don't care how typical we are with ourselves he says apart from me you can do nothing apart from him i can do nothing today i want to let you know the power of the holy spirit the presence of god is here and he wants to do something on the inside of you which cannot be done with your wit your ideas or your gifting it is all about allowing his presence to impact your life somebody say today
