[Music] thank you Hebrews chapter 13 verse 20 and 21. this is the benediction the final exhortation the the farewell that the author is giving it is the wrap-up at the end of his text and I keep saying the author because biblical Scholars have come to give Clarity that they're unsure of who to accredit this authorship to but there is a a poignant space that I felt that we needed to just hear today and it says this in verse 20. now may the god of of Peace somebody say peace it's important that you understand that he is the god of peace because in order to get through what God has for you you're going to have to have a peace that goes beyond your understanding it's going to have to supersede what you expected to be comfortable and to be doable by yourself you're going to have to trust in God so he says now may the God of Peace who through the blood of the Eternal Covenant brought back from the dead our lord Jesus he he wants to give you a Clarity that he this God that we're speaking of is in direct connection with Jesus Christ who is the Messiah who is the Son of God and he's saying the same Jesus the one who brings peace is the one who is all powerful in everything that he does he says this that Lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the Sheep the Bible says we are his sheep we are a part of his pasture he says equip you with everything good that's the highlighted part that's that's the part when you're in your Bible and you've got that pin right there and you just go out in you you're underline it and he said it says it but he equipped you with every good for doing his will and making work in US let's get that Clarity God is not here to work for you God is here to work in you what is pleasing to him through Christ Jesus for the Bible says there is no other way to whom be glory forever and ever somebody say Amen I want to come from this topic and share with you on this morning from the space of this title under the circumstances under the circumstances can we pray father I pray today that in this moment that you would open our hearts and eyes and our ears to hear what you have to say we need you we love you and we honor you in Jesus name somebody say Amen thank you so much musicians y'all can y'all help me give it up for our amazing dream team y'all that's in the building come on help me celebrate them big time thank you thank you thank you anybody ever heard that phrase under the circumstances anybody ever been there before where someone has tried to explain the reason for the place of where they are in life they're trying to explain the reason why they are where they are and they say this phrase under the circumstances I understand why you are where you are in life under the circumstances I get that this is where you've come to and this is the place that you you have found yourself because what we do is identify that circumstances are a limit to us moving forward circumstances are a limit to us growing and moving in Direction because we believe that circumstances are the controlling factors in our life of how we live and what we can do and where we go under the circumstance means given the difficult nature of the situation under the state of conditions there is a reason there is an excuse there is a probable cause for why I am the way I am [Applause] there's a reason I'm where I am in my life there's a reason that things look the way they look there's a reason that I like things the way that I like them there's a reason that I get upset there's a reason I don't like people there's a reason that the state of where I am is not good there's a reason that there's hard areas in my life that I can't give up is it that we have a reason under the circumstances for why we keep staying where we are and I'm at the top of the year to tell you that under the circumstances you may say I'm doing pretty good in life under the circumstances of where I am and what I'm doing I have gotten far but here's what I want to let you know today is that the circumstances that you are living living under is the lead to the potential of the purpose that God has set over your life the circumstances of where you are I want to share with you today have brought a sense of a headspace that you can only get to this point and this area of your life because of the circumstances of your life but I want to let you know today is that some of the circumstances in your life have become the excuses for you to let yourself off the hook of not fulfilling the potential and the purpose that God has over your life I want to share with you that there are some circumstances in life that you cannot avoid and you cannot change but it has to stop being the limiter in your life for where you will go and who you will be you were born with a set of circumstances but it is not what controls your life I'm here today to tell you that your circumstances do not dictate your life hmm anybody ever had somebody come to them and talk about the circumstance I I if you understood my life you would know that this condition of where I am is always limited but here's one of the things that I want to tell you is that the only limits that you have placed on your life are the limits that have been set within your thinking and in the way that you see life and they have brought you to a place in process where you have limited the great things that God wants to do only recognizing that I get limited because of my thinking I stay where I am and I never move from where God would have me to be I want to tell you that your potential is unlimited but your circumstances will tell you you will never get to where God has called for you to be I'm here today to be able to share on the first of the year and 2023 is that you have the ability to supersede and exceed a places that you have never imagined I am here to let you know this morning that there there are generational things that are weighed on your shoulders and on your neck that God has called you to break through and break free from but if you don't get under the circumstances if you don't get from under the condition of where your mind has been set you will live life with a constant lid of where you are and what you can do under the circumstances means that you are always find an excuse and a reason for the reasons that you can't be everything God has called you to be you've used your children you use your job you use your house you use your car you have user your education you have used your way of thinking you have used your past you have used your present and if you find out you'll use your future ah because under the circumstance gives me a way out and keeps me from taking responsibility for the things that I know are inside of me but have not worked their way out of me and I believe today that there is something that God has called you to that is greater than the subset of circumstances that you're living in today now I want you to take a look around your life and and look at the things that that that are in your life and I want you to have an idea that if you did not have those things would your life change where you are some of you said if I didn't have any kids I'm trying to tell you I'd be out of here I've been doing everything no no no I don't think your children are the issue to why you're not where you are I think your thinking is holding you back from seeing everything that God has called for you to be for the Bible says this is the same Lord and whom raised Jesus from the dead he's saying there is a power that God has that can go beyond any dead set of circumstances that are in your life but here's what you must understand if I have a God who can raise the Dead have a God who can move any situation that I find myself in out of the way so that I can be and become everything he's called me to be I want to tell you it don't matter if you got no kids or 15 whatever God has placed in your life you have the ability to accomplish everything he's called you to I want to let you know today you may not have graduated and finished but your education is not holding you back from the next season of your life that God has over you I want to tell you today your income is not the problem to the job that God has laid on your heart and the business that God has called you to it's not your circumstances it's your way of thinking he gives us Clarity to say that this God and whom raised Jesus from the grave it's the same God that can move and open any door that can break down any barrier he is the same God that can split the sea when seeds don't split he is the same God that can rest in a bush and watch it burn but not burn at the same time he is the same God who can give it a blind eyes and open them up so that they can see what he's trying to tell you is there is no limit to what God can do in your life but you have to believe that he is the god of the impossible if he is not the god of the impossible you will always be under the circumstances of what life is bringing you and I am here today to take the crutch away and say it's time now to begin to walk to where God has called for you to walk [Applause] our reasons for why we do and don't have kept us from being the greatest version of who God created us to be one reason we fail to progress in fulfilling our purpose is that we have accepted that the present state of Our Lives is the best we can do under the circumstances we've just we've locked in this is life anybody ever been there before you've looked around you've measured you've you've seen the set of circumstances you you've you've put it all together and you just said to yourself This [Music] and because this is my life I have to settle that this is as far as I can go and I'm here today to let you know that you have not seen how far you can go I want to let you know it is not your finances that determine how far you can go it is not the strength in your body I mean the literal physical strength in your body that can tell you where you can go it's not the condition of your health it is not the understanding of your job it is not the addiction that you are battling or trying to get over it is not the depression or the anxiety it is the state of mind that my God is limited and I'm here today to break free in your mind that God has no barriers but you foreign you are the only barrier to God doing Supernatural things to do more than you ask or think but you have become the barrier because your mind has been set on the things that are problems and circumstances and now your words and your mind have attached themselves together in such a way that you have been speaking against your own breakthrough ah it's hard but the Bible says you're more than a conqueror so won't you add on to God it's hard but I'm already a conqueror see it's not denying the present state of what is but it's recognizing it's not the only set of circumstances when you can get that in your mind you can recognize that it may be hard in this season but God says I am an overcomer so along with the heart is the promise that God has already spoken over my life so I can declare even in the truth of what is now under the circumstances God is calling you to his purpose and his plan the concept of uncircumstances serves to imprison us and to immobilize our god-given ambition because too many of us have surrendered to the status quo and become prisoners of War for our minds we have forgotten the circumstances are temporary Arrangements of life to which we are all exposed I was writing this down as the Lord was pressing it on my heart and I wanted to read it just it says we Overlook and disregard the face that these circumstances are designed the circumstance you are in now is designed to identify expose develop refine and maximize our true potential this was never a call to be a permanent set of where you would stay quick thing is that some of us have created a permanency in a temporary circumstance this is life this is who I am [Music] I am and God says not so here's what it's called to be able to do to identify to expose to develop to refine and maximize your true potential what does that mean it gives me the ability to see that there's more work to be done in my life you are not done where you are because there is something to be exposed identified refine develop and to maximize the potential of where you are the pressure that's on you is supposed to maximize you not defeat you because he already declared that you were more than a conqueror you you got into your feelings and allow your circumstances to be the longevity of your life instead of a temporary circumstance and you found your mind at a place where you said I'll deal with where I am instead of saying I'll conquer where I am you've got to understand this he never called you to settle where you are he called you to rise up and say God if you don't be before me then I don't know what I'm going to do but if you are before me who can be against me now when I understand this I get the clarity and understand this thing is only to maximize the greatness that God has settled on the inside of me why do I feel so wary because I'm recognizing there's more inside foreign [Applause] why am I being pressured and pushed why our tears flowing down my eyes why am I up praying and asking God what should I do he's pushing you he's pressuring you he's trying to maximize what's inside of you he never called you to quit at this stage of your life because it got hard he already was telling you that anything that I have for you is going to require some dying to yourself it's going to require some maturing it's going to require some bearing of fruit some Joy some peace some kindness some goodness some faithfulness some self-control what he's saying is is I am the fine Jew you are the branch if you stick with me I'll carry you the whole way but if you try to do it on yourself it'll be impossible what I want to give you today is God says this with man it is impossible but with God somebody say all things all things are possible [Applause] if you stop living under the circumstances you're called to be stretched and maximize you're not called to be comfortable and stay where you are there's something great on the inside of you that you haven't discovered yet can I can I tell you there's a portion of you that you don't even know can I tell you there is a skill set on the inside of you that you did not even understand was one of your greatest skills and potential do you understand that just because you've been promoted in the world to the top of where you can be has nothing to do with where God wants to take you see in the world you get to a Max and you just say what that's it I'm done I can make two decisions I can leave and look for something to take me higher or I can choose to retire from what I have reached my Max and the Bible lets us know is that there's something greater in me that's in the world if I understand there's greater in me then that means there must be something that's maximized inside of me that I haven't even seen yet see here's the thing the reason why you stop where you are because it got hard is because you're comparing yourself to people where you are or people lower than where you are and you figure I'm doing better than others so I'll stop where I am because where I am is greater than where a lot of people are but but you don't understand the DNA in which Psalms 139 speaks to which says you've been created and formed in the image and likeness of God and you put limits on your life that only you can get to this place and you said to yourself well I'm making as much as I can make it I have as many degrees as I can happen and I can't go any further and God says you have only touched the tip of the iceberg here's the thing if you haven't fallen and crushed Yourself by now with all the pressure that's on you imagine if you actually trusted God with all of it and put all the pressure on him and said Lord it's not my responsibility to fulfill your will it's my responsibility to be obedient to your will and you will fulfill the purpose that you have over my life what if you let it all go and gave it over to God do you understand you're only at the tip of the iceberg of what God wants to do he said I'll do exceeding abundantly above all that you could even ask or think it's crazy that God I would think about using me more than I could think about using myself but when I live under the circumstances I limit the possibilities and I wait for someone to confirm that I'm at a good place so that I don't have to pressure myself to move any forward [Music] one of the greatest reasons that you have stopped Where You Are is because there are too many people around you who are speaking and they don't have a clue of what they're talking about what I've learned in this generation is there's a lot of people who can give information for things they have not lived they have not walked through they have not sustained themselves in everybody's got a word everybody's got a a a a a good a good quote to give you everybody's got something tweetable to say but most people have not standed the test of times so the voices that you keep hearing from of voices that are in the same place that you are dealing with the same issues you're dealing with and feeling the same pressure you're feeling so they're telling you don't go any further than where you are just stay right where you are because through their learning they've already given up to say life is just too hard because they didn't go back to their word to understand that they were more than a conqueror processor I get it it's easy to say but it's harder to do no no no it's harder to trust than it is to be able to think that God if you could really do this in my life it would exceed my expectations and many of us have allowed our circumstances to become our status quo because we've allowed people to talk Us in to common places Point number one when you want to stop living under the circumstances you will limit the voices in your life limit who's speaking limits who's being able to speak into your heart here's the thing is that when you're trying to get from under a set of circumstances you must determine the State you're willing to hear because the voice for you is the voice that goes against the things that bring you comfort it's going to test you it's going to pull out your pride you're going to become defensive and irritate it you're not going to like them that much but because God sent them they don't care they're not easily flustered because they've been through themselves come on they've walked through the maturity they walk through the efforts they've been at the place where someone got real with them so guess what getting real with you and you trying to get real back doesn't scare them at all and you think scaring them off is a thing you do because you've always self-sabotage for the purposes of staying where you are in a place of comfort but the voices that God has in your life are voices that say it and then leave because they're waiting to talk again once you actually make a move their voices that have spoken a word and have left you alone there are voices that say in trouble you can call me but if you don't call then you must don't need the healing that you say you need yeah their voices that understands that when something is Unified the Bible lets us know even from Genesis that anything that's unified well can do anything but it's the voices that we like to hear that bring us Comfort it's the versus that side on our side it's the voice that tells us you're doing just enough [Music] you're doing just enough to be okay because what the world is speaking right now is be all right where you are do it how you like don't listen to everybody make sure that you can do it the way you feel everything is telling you your feelings are valid so go with them but the problem is we don't like listening because we want to hear everybody who gives us a like we don't want to hear the people who have value to add [Music] because they may hold us accountable for something that we've been avoiding all our life in verse 20 it says he is the great Shepherd he is the shepherd over the Sheep well what does a Shepherd do a Shepherd feeds leads and watches over his sheep the Bible lets us know that their men and women whom God is called to be under Shepherds meaning they're doing the work where Christ leads but they are part of keeping the flock together these under shepherds are are people who are hearing the voice of God and they know his personal in John chapter 10 my sheep know my voice and the stranger they will not follow a question is is have you heard the voice of the Lord enough to know God's voice when he's speaking because here's what happens is sheep get with the shepherd and as the Sheep get with the shepherd they start to learn the shepherd's voice because they understand the shepherd is going to take them to greener pastures if you could understand that the Sheep are looking for a pasture to be able to feed from and to grow from you would understand the Sheep are looking for a voice now you can mix sheep together from another pastor but if they don't know the voice of the shepherd the Bible lets us know they will not follow here is the problem that we have is that we have a group of Christians who know about Jesus but don't know his voice and because they don't know his voice they're looking for other Shepherds to follow because they've not heard the voice of the Lord the Bible says they have eyes but they cannot see they have ears but they cannot hear just because you're in the sheep and does not mean you can hear the Shepherds [Applause] just because you come to church doesn't mean you're in alignment with God [Applause] Church environment foreign Ty of personal relationship [Applause] Pastor I know you yeah you do but when we get to heaven [Music] I'm making up my version and we in line and I'm in line I'm like oh boy [Applause] I hope they did the Monday through Saturday work only but so much I could do on Sunday there was only so much I could give on that day I hope they took it home and I hope they decided to listen to the voices that God placed in their life here's the thing there are the voices that God has placed in your life that you need to hear here's the voice that you need to hear before you ask any Pastor Prophet teacher friend professional you need to hear the voice of the Lord that's why we're going on 21 days of prayer because some of us need a tune-up on hearing God's voice some of us need a cleansing you know they have those things the lower earwax thing where you you take you take the you take the little camera inside the ear and you're trying to flush it out because there's something preventing the ear that's what we do with the fasting part the fasting helps us to be able to clear out all the things that bring a distraction and keep us from hearing the voice of the Lord and we put some things aside and we're saying God I'm willing to remove some things so that I can hear you because I want to hear your voice that's what 21 days of prayer is and we're hearing God's word Voice through his word and through the Holy Spirit [Music] that's your first stop when getting direction it's in an alignment with God's word [Applause] is it a connection with the Holy Spirit Pastor I haven't heard from the holy spirit in a long time that's where you need to stop right now don't you call another person don't you ask another individual you need to stop right there if I don't have the word and I don't have the Holy Spirit then there's going to be a disconnect and direction of what God wants to speak do not get above yourself giving information and getting information from people that are right where you are you need to hear the voice of the Lord then the Bible says you're to get wise counsel there are people that God has placed in your life friends family parents grandparents uncles aunts that have the voice of the Lord speaking in their life pastors Elders teachers leaders that can lead and guide you not to control you but to give you what guidance and where because you need wise counsel you do not know everything [Applause] foreign get some counsel there's a voice of God the spiritual counsel and then there's trusted professionals there are some trusted people professionally who can help break through barriers because of your lack of understanding emotions your lack of understanding what a unhealthy past your lack of understanding what unforgiveness does that they can walk you through the process of your healing so that your healing doesn't stay stagnant and you have to stay where you are now your marriage is broken because you're living under the circumstances you are where you are with your children because you are living under the circumstances well what are the circumstances a broken relationship from your past what are the circumstances that I did not have parents that could take me to where I'm going so you don't have everything you need you need trusted individuals that God will place in your life to bring you to the place where you can hear the voice please do not mistaken your knowledge for wisdom wisdom comes process [Music] time and process you want to eliminate opinions and you want to start getting to the truth of the matter Point number two is that when you're under the circumstances here's something that you have to do you have to walk the Journey of change walk the Journey of change he said in his word I will equip somebody say equip you with every thing good for doing his will the question is have you been equipped through your journey of change has change taken place where you are here's where change starts inward before it starts outward inward change stop trying to change your clothes and think it is going to change your mind it only has a temporary effect anybody ever dressed up before I mean you felt good y'all y'all know y'all had these Christmas parties y'all know how y'all went I mean y'all some of y'all New Year's Eve that's why some of you like Jesus keep me keep me right now but right now anybody anybody know when you put on your good vests anybody know about that you shine those shoes up you you pull out the cufflings you you put all the good jewelry on I mean if they catch you out there they are taking you for everything that you got you understand you don't want everything that is the top of the line you didn't put it on you didn't wash it you didn't looked at it you didn't got it all together and the problem that we oftentimes find is that we're trying to feel what we look like on the outside but it is harder to change inwardly than it is to change outwardly [Applause] anybody have any financial goals this year you can hear somebody preach write the vision make it plain you'll be like I've written it 50 times I am broke I can't write it no more I don't wrote The Vision I done wrote my account number I done wrote my routing number to God just in case he just didn't know which account I needed him to put it in [Applause] but just because you write the vision if you're not willing to operate in the change of your way of thinking financially it will not get you anywhere but a written Vision that can go somewhere but has stayed at where it is under the set of circumstances I want to let you know it is not your finances that are limiting to you to where you can go it is your way in seeing that's limiting you to where you can go and what you can do with what you have yes you may not be able to buy your Rolls Royce right now but here's what I want to let you know you got a Corolla on the way and when that Corolla gets started up it's going to take you to your next investment but your next investment is going to take you up a little bit and you're gonna get yourself a C-Class Mercedes now that doesn't mean you're all the way yet you're still working just to get there but I'm here today to let you know if you don't start somewhere you're in the back where you already were foreign you got to say to yourself this year I can't stay this place my marriage can't stay here my mindset can't stay here my addiction can't stay here my way of thinking can't stay here I have got to get out of this place here's what I thought about remember this you will never change anything that you're willing to tolerate you will never change anything that you're willing to give an excuse for if you'll tolerate it you'll stay where you are if you tolerate that you'll stay right where you are [Music] we will make an excuse so that we don't have to change yet we will struggle in tears for why we are back where we were before what are you tolerating that God has called for you to set a standard to real real quick real quick if you walk the Journey of change here's what I believe is that you will find yourself living out the same way that you've been living and every New Year's resolution while it could be effective stays at the same place here's the thing real quick oh can I can I tell you something this anytime you want go go to your photos and go back to January go to your photos for you Androids I don't know galleries something I don't know I don't know what it is you should just throw the whole phone away but anyway go to your photos [Music] because everybody always think Pastor got a lot I know he just don't understand and I dare you scroll through your photos and videos and see your own progress see see where you I love this because everybody's putting up man put your best moments of 2022. I I dare you go through your photos and while you went on vacation I I dare you to look at your bank account and see if it's still at the same place you had a good time but you get anywhere financially in your goals [Applause] and it's scary you don't want to do that because you might get some way and start crying and take a look did you reach anything that you said from the year before here's something crazy I I dare you go back and look at 2021 and then look at 2022. and see if anything changed somebody deleting all their photos no no I will not do that I will not take myself through that abuse my question is is that it's not you facing me it's you facing you [Applause] just go look at it because if you really got somewhere then you'll see the change that happened if you didn't [Applause] stop doing so much talking this year that's getting a little snippy yeah he is yeah he is because if your marriage was busted last year and you don't see any changes of Happiness growing in it that means you didn't do anything to make it better she did what stood and complained so you got to figure out where you're going with this because God is saying you don't need to live under the circumstances anymore I got a ton of vacations yet I'm still where I am still doing what I'm doing at the place still receiving what I'm seeing and with the same person that's still been keeping me down [Applause] [Music] can I oh my gosh we gotta go okay can I tell somebody real quick real quick real quick if you're getting set free go back a year ago to where you were if God is bringing freedom in your life go back to where you are and remember how you looked remember how depression remember where you were you were Freedom more seriously if you went back and looked at where you were and you were saving yourself I am not going back anybody got that testimony they just want I I will I I will not go back under the circumstances here's what it's going to do it's going to force you to come up with intentional prayers that you will go before God and say not this year foreign because we like lying to ourselves to make ourselves feel good because that's where we get Comfort because we don't have to change God's put voices in our life that have told us you can go back and look at your patches go back and look at your timeline go back and see you still complaining I'm sick of it you've been complaining about that for five years you got a project that's supposed to get out that you were supposed to do go back and look at the files and see the date on it 47 A.D [Music] can I tell you got to walk the journey to change and then this is the last one we got to stay for the results so some of us are quitting too early in the game but keep opting out this was a word that the lord gave me this year was unique consistency [Music] you're trying to live out of this flashy idea that multiple change equals this creative context to where nothing can hold me down because I'm so full of ideas and here's the problem it's not that you're full of ideas is that you have no sustainability to stand the Bible says having done all stand and then after you finish standing stand some more [Applause] and then after you finish standing stand some more you know how much standing I got to do you got to stand until the time comes some of y'all are bugging out about number two I can see it in your face y'all like I I'm not going to my photos I promise I'm not doing that because if you go I'm just leaning back to that some of you like I look sad now I look sad in 2022 I look sad in 2021 you have looked the same way because there's no change and the problem of it is is because you don't stay to see the results the results would change your expression it would change where you are it would change your outlook that I can do this I am more than God's word now means something because of the consistency of you walking through with his word the reason why more than a conqueror does not click is because you have not withstand the test of times enough to See the Conquering take place in your life because you have always been quitting because under the set of circumstances [Music] this is as far as I can get I want to tell you today stop justifying your quitting someone tell your neighbor real quick stick with it stick with it [Music] yeah stick with it I want you to look at I want you to take the picture today I don't want you to look in a month and be like I said I would stick with it [Music] I said I you got to remind yourself what you said we love pictures go if you're married go back to your photo album when you were standing there staring at one another smiling I love it I love you no I love you everybody in the back was like um [Applause] [Music] and go back I say are we still working on what we promised to do at that altar y'all it's not gonna be easy but it's worth it and I want to say that to you today this is not the message of go drop your friends [Music] you know we top of the year you tell y'all to look at your name and tell them let them go it's like nah the work is in US y'all that's where the work is it's in us because when you start working on you they drop off by themselves [Applause] changing I've been trying this for a long time you're getting offended and you need markers you know you you don't pick up like you used to I know I'm working on me [Music] I want to pray for you today that you will stop living under the circumstances someone I want to take my greatest fear as a pastor is when people think they've got it together [Music] the Bible says humble yourself before the mighty hand of God humble your karani humble me today I need you I need you to do in me with only you can do all right so I promised this and I'll give it God said Lord what's the word for the year I'm a pastor if you don't give me a word for the year I don't look credible [Music] the Lord said not give me your word I said okay he said I'm gonna give you a phrase for your people for my people and the word for 2023 or the phrasing that God has given me is from Genesis chapter 12. which is every blessing that God has for you is so that you can be a blessing you will be blessed this year according to your ability to bless Church [Music] others according to what God has called us to do [Music] so here is what I'm pushing you is that everything you're asking for this year Lord I just need it so I can be a blessing here's what I'm going to tell you once you run out of vessels to bless you run out of blessing Pastor I don't even have anything to give or to be a blessing it's not about what you have it's about what you can do to be a blessing here's the reason why your prayer is getting stuck and the idea of the Lord bless me enlarge my territory God is saying what have you blessed I bless you so that you can be a blessing once we get in our own way we start only thinking about our blessings so here is what I'm speaking over this this congregation I am speaking blessings according to Blessings may you be blessed according to the way that you bless others in the name of Jesus foreign [Music] anybody believe you're going to be blessed come on just if you just believe you just put your hand up in there oh I'm gonna be blessed anybody already saying I'm gonna bless somebody else too last part I'm gonna tell y'all you gotta when you get needy people around you be okay with it they're your vessels [Music] I always call and asking me for stuff that's the reason why you keep getting blessed is because you keep pouring out if you don't pour out then you stop the flow in yeah [Music] you get five dollars tell somebody you want 250. because another five is coming that's gonna make it 7.50 I'm good to go y'all know what I'm saying I'm just gonna keep pouring out so that I can be a blessing
