[Music] anybody ready for the word of god today yeah we're in mark mark chapter 11 we're in the new testament gospel and just believing that there is something that god wants to speak today and i'm excited for us that the lord is still speaking to our church that he is still speaking a word to not only encourage us but to move us from where we are to where god has called for us to be so here in the mix we say that note-takers are what tell your neighbor real quick say you're a world changer and that we believe that leaders are what readers so as we read the word of god as we take notes god is going to pour into us and speak a word of life into our lives it is palm sunday and so i do want to promise you you will walk out with your palm um the very thing that keeps your car holy that you will hang from your your dash and fold it into a cross now we don't have cross-folding stations available for you so you're going to have to see somebody work that thing out or you're going to have to go on youtube and do a diy and try to get that thing rolling but i want to let you know today we will definitely help you as much as you can uh when you see our prayer team come down please don't ask them for prayer on how to fold your cross that's not what the prayer line is for somebody say amen starting at verse one it says now when they drew near to jerusalem speaking of jesus and his disciples it says to beth phage and bethany at the mount of olives jesus sent two of his disciples and he said to them he said go into the village in front of you and immediately as you enter it you will find a cult tied on which no one has ever sat he says untie it and bring it if anyone says to you why are you doing this say the lord has need of it and we'll send it back here immediately and when they went away they found a cult tied at a door outside in the street and they untied it and some of those standing there said to them what are you doing untying the cult and they told them what jesus said and they let them go i felt that the lord said some of you are trying to argue about your purpose you don't need to argue all you need to do is just tell people what jesus said it may not even make sense to you today but all you need to do is say listen i don't even agree with it all the way but jesus told me this was the way to go so i'm in a i'm in agreement with them and it says and they brought the cult to jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it and many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that's where we get the palms from on palm sunday and it says it and they spread the branches that they could cut from the fields and it says and those who went before and those who follow were shouting hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our father david hosanna in the highest i want to speak from a topic today it's my time it's my time can you just tell your neighbor just say it's my time can you can you find a second neighbor that don't look too mean and just and then tell them real quick say it's my time can you find the third choice that don't look as aggravated and say third choice i'm sorry but it's my time it's my time let's pray father in the name of jesus we thank you so much for this moment and this opportunity that you've given us for we understand that it is our time to be to go to do all that you have called for us to do for we love you we honor you and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians and i just want to celebrate huge those that are a part of what we call our dream team our volunteers that make what happens in this place happening can you help me celebrate them real big on today amen amen amen i want to tell you let's just get plugged into the word of god today i i believe today's passage is speaking about jesus and jesus coming into jerusalem and the bible says he came into jerusalem knowing that there were threats on his life he knew that the pharisees and those who were part of the sanhedrin that the religious leaders is what they called them he knew that they wanted to take his life but here's what jesus knew is that the purpose of what the father had called him to was greater than his fears was greater than his apprehensions it was greater than what he felt on the inside he knew that he had a mission today i want to let you know that you are called to be in passage to where god has called for you to be i want to let you know there may be some fear there may be some intrepidation there may be some components of knowing that there are some people that won't like it but here's what i want to let you know today is that your purpose is greater than your fears your purpose is greater than the ideas of what you believe in the ideas of what you think and the ideologies of what people are saying is you and isn't you i want to speak this to you today is that god has called you to something greater than how you feel and everybody knows that oftentimes our feelings can control the direction of where we're going the feelings can be a disturbing factor and keeping us from reaching the purpose that god has called for us to reach we don't want to go back to the old place that we used to go where god has called for us to pull people out because we're scared that we ourselves will get pulled back in but today i want to let you know whatever it is that god has set you up for you don't have to be afraid because the bible says he is with you he's with you today many times we hear in scripture don't don't don't don't be afraid don't worry don't don't get scared not scared but the bible says don't get scared because if you get scared then you can't really reach the potential of where god is calling for you to be in and i'm here to let you know that at many a times is that the thing that you are so afraid of is the very thing that god is calling you to can i tell you that a stage used to petrify me can i listen i like the idea of singing in the background you know like i like the idea of being the person that was not out front i love being the person that would just handle and make things happen and we all love to say this is this idea of you know i i don't do that that's not what i do that's not my personality but oftentimes what shapes our personality is the resistance to the purpose god has called us to because we walk in fear of what that purpose may require us to do your purpose is going to require something of you that you have not done before and there is no way that in the familiar you can see the miracles that god has for your life because miracles don't happen in the familiar there's something about the unfamiliar that god gets to work because his faith is working things out for the good and it's working it out so well that you didn't know that all of the things that you count is broken god is going to turn it and use it for the very purpose that he called you do why is that important is because oftentimes we will find ourselves in the place where we're trying to form a perfect life but god says i don't need a perfect past nor do i need a perfect present in order to give you the future that i've called you too oftentimes you're trying to clean it up i know how i am i'm trying to clean it up i'm trying to make it look good i'm trying to sweep it to the side none of you has ever given a resume that said i got fired because my mouth got me in trouble why don't we put that on a resume because oftentimes we're always trying to present the best version of ourselves not knowing that the areas of our life that are broken can still be used for the glory of god so we get scared of our testimonies that god has given us and we shy back because we believe our testimonies or the fragile part of our lives are as something a strike against us but i want to let you know that today your testimony is the very evidence of that god is present in your life [Music] i understand oftentimes that where i am and how i've been operating i used to be nervous about telling people the the stories of what i've gone through and and the areas of my life that i've hidden and and when i got sick i thought it was an area that became weak to me like like like weak people are the only people that get sick and when i first thought about sickness i said you know you know god must i must have done something wrong god must be punishing me for an area that i was in but i didn't really understand the scripture that was letting me know all things work together for the good so often times when i don't understand that god can use the things that look broken and look at the things that look messed up for my good i'm always praying for him to change my situation instead of allowing my situation to change me i never forget being on the bed and saying lord if you don't if you don't heal me lord please i haven't done anything uh lord you know you start going over your whole financial reports lord i tithe i know i miss one sunday but uh lord i pray that this is not because of the one sunday and lord when i when i cuss that lady out lord i didn't mean to do so it was just that traffic was on me and uh i was late for me and you know how you start repenting like you're you're in a priest's booth you start giving god everything like and that time and the lord is like you're trying to explain to me the reason why you shouldn't be in this moment but the problem is is you don't understand this moment was sent to make you this moment was sent to change you because truthfully the person that you are you're living but you're not living like like like like you're living you're you're getting up every day you're you're going to work you're making the bread that you're supposed to make you're you're killing the gang financially but the problem is is that your wholeness is not as in shape as it should be so you're always relying on something exterior to be able to make you feel good about who you are and people don't understand why you have peace in your toyota corolla i mean let's not get it wrong you know there's nothing wrong with your mercedes there's nothing there's nothing wrong with your lexus there's nothing wrong with your truck there's nothing wrong with your your your maybach so i know somebody in here might be driving on but here's what i want to let you know is that your peace is not wrapped up in the things that you have and so when the enemy begins to trick us to make us believe that our destiny and our purpose is tied up in things we always pursue things but we don't pursue him so we run from thing to thing and job to job and relationship to relationship and friendship to friendship and we keep posting it we keep telling people i'm doing well on the inside though we're empty i've been there i've been i've been empty i've been i've been i've been religious but i haven't been in a relationship and a big part of that came from this idea that the things that weren't going well in my life were a result of god trying to punish me but the problem of it is is god wasn't trying to punish me god was trying to make me just tell your neighbor real quick he's trying to make you but some of you want to tell your neighbor back i don't want to be made. because making means shifting and altering the bible says he is the potter and we are the clay and sometimes you've got to break the clay to remote it to fit the purpose of what it was supposed to do because sometimes if you don't look at it properly the atmosphere and the environment and and and the air and the conditioner can restructure and reform pottery into another shape it was never supposed to be and i'm i'm here today to let you know is that he's trying to shape us but if you don't know he's trying to shape you you'll stay where you are and as comfortable as you are you'll think this is enough and you have to keep motivating yourself with the things on the outside to say it's enough you got to have more kids you got to show more people that here's what's going on you got to show folk this is what's happening in my life and you got to find something to fulfill the place of where you are so that you feel good about where you're supposed to be but the problem is is you will never feel good until you start fulfilling your purpose there is no house that will give you what you need there is no car that will set you up for what you need you need something that can set you free somebody say i need freedom god knows i need some freedom in this place god knows i need freedom in my mind god knows i need freedom in my heart i need an opportunity for god to work in my life like never before but here's the problem oftentimes i'm tied up with my past which is affecting my presence in the scripture that we have we see that jesus is is on his way into jerusalem as they begin to declare him to be king and they begin to exalt him because we love exalting a god that will do something for us and we get the roles mixed because we think we're the potter and he's the clay [Music] it's like he's molding and we're telling god no no no i i said it i said i wanted a relationship but it's got to look like this lord so if you could just turn your attention this way in and god i set the job i wanted the job to look this way so if you can turn the job this way you no you got it all wrong i said i need uh six zeros you only gave me five and i need you to help me out or you you i need you to shape it right and god is saying i think you've got your roles in reverse he's saying because oftentimes i i want to let you know that i know what i have for you there's a plan to establish your work there's a plan to make you greater there's a plan to to bring you into an understanding and a clarity but i i speak this over your life today if you'd untie the way that you're thinking if you don't untie the way that you're seeing if you don't untie the way that god is moving in your life you will always be stuck to the place that the enemy tied you to the bible says that as jesus is coming into jerusalem he knows by plan what is supposed to happen this is not something he's guessing as he's going this is not something he's figuring out as he's moving along jesus knows the exact plan for his life here's the question i asked you today if there is a plan for jesus's life why don't you think there's a plan for your life the bible says it was already written out in the book i want to let you know that your plan is written out in his book even though you keep trying to change it the bible lets us know there is already a plan of how your life is going to go written out in the book jesus had his plan and full view written out in the book and we understand he because he gives us instruction the bible says he tells two disciples hey disciples i need you to go and get a cold go get a donkey there's already a problem right there why is jesus going to go get a donkey everybody knows when when when we're at pimlico racetrack we're not racing donkeys y'all why are we racing donkeys because they're not really fast they don't look great they don't look to be in the best shape they're they're not something that's truly a contender so we look to go after horses my god should be riding on a horse a stallion the best breed the one with the hair that some of us no no no i didn't say that the hair that flows all the way down muscular and built that's how jesus should come riding in because the idea is that jesus to us is the one who comes in to fix everything he said no i came to bring my kingdom so that that which has already been declared in heaven is that which is taking place on earth i'm not coming in your life to save you from what you don't like because what you don't like is creating the person i need you to be and if you could become the person i need you to be then you could live out the purpose i called you to live out your family could get to where they're supposed to be your husband could get to where he needs to be your wife can get to where they need to be your children could be in place and set to understand that there's legacy in there your church could be blessed by who you are i'm here today to let you know if you could just grab a hold of your purpose so many things around you could begin to change it's more than just being about your salvation but what you've got to get an understanding of is that god is trying to do something in you to do something in someone else to do something in your community to do something in your family to do something in your life but what i believe today that you must understand is that if we don't understand the purpose is not just about us it's not just about us it's just not about us can you tell your neighbor real quick just in case they didn't hear me through this loud mic can you tell them it's not about you it can't be about you it's about his kingdom and the idea was he was coming in to save them from roman oppression he says i'm not here to save you from roman oppression i'm here to bring the kingdom that i have in heaven back here on earth to restore what i started in eden so that you can live out the life i've called you to live out whether you're oppressed or whether you're living free whether you're under bondage or whether you're finding yourself living the best life possible what i want to let you know is that when i am with you you can endure all things when i am with you you don't have to live in the state of your brokenness when i am with you you can heal from your dad's situations when i'm with you you can heal from your mom's situations when i am with you you can be freed from your addiction when i am with you you can be a comforter and be comforted [Applause] it's when i'm with you it's when i'm moving in your life it's when i'm establishing something great within you when i am with you you can do all things but the problem is is most of us we get tied up we get we get tied up with our opinions we get tied up with our ideas we we get tied up with ourselves and the problem is is that god wants to use you but you're too tied up with you go go go go go jesus says go go into the town you see and there's a cult there it says go go into the town you see there's there's a there's a cult there hasn't been ridden hasn't been touched it's specifically a cult for me i want to let you know today that god is in need of you and he's ready to untie you so you can live out the purpose he's called you to if you could understand it's your responsibility to be a part of allowing him to untie you from where you are what's palm sunday about palm sunday is about getting untied why would god use somebody like you why you're you're not the stallion you're not the one that everyone bets on you're you're not the one that everybody looks at as being so graceful you're you're a little clumsy you mess it up sometimes you you don't have the speech or the education that you would want to have you're finding yourself in a place where things seem to be broken but i want to say to you that god is in need of you today can you tell your neighbor real quick god needs you i want to tell you that god needs you and he's ready to untie you from your past he's ready to untie you from your addictions he's ready to untie you from your broken desires he's a ready to untie you from your own will he's ready to untie you from the bondage that you used to be in and he's saying i'm ready to use you nobody thought they would use you nobody thought that you would even be worth using because you've been tied up for so long you've been sitting on the side and oftentimes people look at you you where's your dad at you're not worthy of being used and you're saying my physical father might not be here but my supernatural father is being here and why would he use somebody like you the whole time god has been waiting to use you but he's just tied you up just a little bit so that when you got loose you you you weren't like everybody else you were different there there are some things you weren't exposed to that that everybody else was exposed to there's some areas in your life that you found yourself that you just didn't know about because here's what i want to let you know today some things that god didn't show you were for your own benefit because sometimes we're too smart for our own selves i i if i could say this to you sometimes you know too much you know you know too much why because when when you know too much you think you have the answers to everything when you know too much people like to tell you who you are and what you would do and what you have the qualifications on but but but you got to be like a resume and say listen i'm not here to talk about my broken past i'm here to show you the good parts of me and the good parts say i've got something great living on the inside of me i'm not like i used to be i'm not who i used to be so when god begins to untie you stop running away to get tied back up and start saying lord i know you want to use me when you when when you're tied up oftentimes you can only go but so far when you're tied up that you you feel like there's there's there's a realm that god is uh uh trying to keep you in that you feel like you're locked into i want to tell somebody today you don't feel like god has answered your prayer but he's tied you up on purpose so that you wouldn't get too far from what he called you too because when he needed to get to you he wants to make sure that you haven't been used by everybody else he wants to make sure your gift hasn't been exploited by everybody else he wants to make sure that when the time comes for him to use you you are in some good condition some of you have been tied up because you've been healing some of you've been tied up because because you're getting your mind back to where it is some of you are tied up because god is teaching you to trust again some of you are tied up because god is exposing you again to areas and people that you haven't been able to be exposed to before some of you are tied up because god's working on you but i just want to let you know today it's time for you to get on tithes god is saying go and go in on time go and release them see because this untied it when when i when i get tied up i can only get to a certain certain place hey charles can you just grab the end of this real quick can you can you can you just take that and can you just walk back with it and just walk back keep going charles keep going keep hold hold right there y'all see the problem is is when i get tied up i only have but so far to be able to reach people and it only gets me to the second and third row of where i'm supposed to be see here's what i want to let you know is that your gift as good as it is is only getting you to a limited place all you need to do is allow god to begin to untie your life and change who you are and here's what i want to let you know today when he begins to change who you are you stop looking the same you stop giving the saying you stop doing things the same way and he says i can trust you with something even greater and he says here's what i'll do i'll give you more exposure i'll open bigger doors i'll grant some greater things in your life and you begin to say god you trust me he says yeah because while you were tied up you were faithful to me some of us aren't willing to be faithful until god does a miracle and here's what i want to tell you is that the miracle never happens in the familiar state that you're in the miracle happens in the unfamiliar moments when you're not even thinking about it when you stopped even praying over it and you started trusting god god said i'll untie it you don't know that the knot is getting looser but the lord says i'm untying it i'm doing everything you need to do and he says and now you see your reach going further charles go back for me just go back a little bit further and he said to me i can pull you back anytime i want to pull you back but here's what i want to let you know i call you [Applause] to something greater but you got to get untied thank you charles lord i need you to untie me today i've trusted in my degree for too long i've trusted in my knowledge for too long i've trusted in my experience for too long i've trusted in my finances too long god i need you to untie me i'm ready to go tell somebody beside you i'm ready to go i don't want to stay where i've been i don't want to keep doing the same things i'm doing i'm even telling you the people around you are getting bored with you you're trying to get people interested but they said well you look the same as you did in 2022 as you did in 21 as you did in 19 as you did in 18 and 17 and you're still singing the same game you're saying guess what i promise you this year i won't look to say why because god is untying me [Applause] the lord is untying me he's shaping me he's shifting me he's moving me but lord i've got to be ready to be used by you i've i got to put all my reserves and all my things to the side that i say i won't do and i can't do anybody know about that anybody got your list i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna tell some of you you've been members here at this church and you've gone through growth track and and you stopped the growth track because you said lord okay this is where i stopped because i don't have a lot of time for this and instead of asking god lord what can i do what you said was here's what i won't do and you have a potter and clay mix-up i'm not doing it you don't know what they did to me i'm not doing it my last church messed me up i'm not doing it what they said to me last time i'm not doing it god says here's the thing i'm not setting you up for what you want i'm setting you up for what i've called you to do you have to live out your purpose regardless if you're offended or not because i'll heal you while you're tied up to get back into the place i've called for you to be you should not be okay with sitting on your gift because somebody made you angry and you know i'm not going to use it god says it's not yours to make the call but i'm afraid i'll get hurt again i was afraid when i was going into jerusalem i got over it i told the lord whatever the will is i'll do it if there's another way come on can we be honest anybody want to talk to jesus real if there's another way anybody got if there's another way kind of on their heart lord if there's there's another way we can do this you don't even get to not my will you just stuck at that prayer you're at that prayer lord i love you but i'm not doing it here's what i'm calling for you today i believe god is freeing you from your own prison of potential and he's moving you into your place of purpose i don't have to be afraid of what's going to happen because i'm depending on god and the bible says when things get weak he makes me strong so the first thing i need you to know in our and our point of being unapologetic to how god is using us is that i want you to know that there is a path set already you're not making up the path you are not pouring concrete let me tell you who you are not a concrete poor you do not pave your own way your way is already paved your path is already set tell somebody my path is set well you know how we get i get like this i start telling people like what's next you know i'm not sure this is wherever i'm going you know i got a lot i got a lot of opportunities i don't have a lot of opportunities i have one path his path opportunities are things we avail ourselves to when the path isn't going where we want it's like i got options you don't have no options this ain't double t donna anybody ever been to double t donna before i used to go there all the time as a musician after a concert church eleven o'clock it's the only place open it smells like mop water but guess what you need to experience it if you're not from baltimore you have to go to double t diner specifically route 40. west i want to get you to the right one if you haven't been there get there a little bit of mop water the water that they bring you taste like fountain fountain of death and i'll never forget going there and there was always what options anybody know how many uh there's seven there's about six to seven pages on the menu i wanna give you one idea if you if you're not a chef i wanna tell you this there is no chef out here cooking seven pages of food no chef i don't care who you are you know in your house you're repeating meals weekly because you have a limit ain't that right i called my brother hey what you cooking this week you know what it is [Applause] it's a couple things i do well and if you want my eating you're gonna have to eat them same things over and over again too many options pulls us out of the place of what we do well and we open ourselves to try to master things we never had to see the potential to do so we start fulfilling the purpose for things that were never called for us to be in and i want to let you know today that god has placed only one option his option and your path so guess what a path is already set you've got to figure out what his path is how do we talk about that go and listen to the message before it's the holy spirit that is guiding your path you're trying to figure out how to do it without around well if i don't get all of do i really need all of the holy spirit it'd be weird if half the holy spirit in you because i don't even know how to talk about that there's a path that's already set the question is are you on that path the scripture lets us know in proverbs 3 and 6 it says this in everything you do acknowledge him and he will see that your paths are straight somebody say straight some of us going all over the place some of y'all know how you're doing you texting you're driving you got you think you're a pro you got one leg on the steering wheel you know how you do you got the phone you like i'm pro i'm good at this until you find yourself hitting that thing on the side of the road that sounds like bumps oh oh i got it i meant to do that no you didn't stop lying you didn't mean to do that you can't drive because you're too distracted away from the purpose of what god's called for you to do so you got to understand your path is set well if my path is set then i need to find out which straight direction am i going which means that you're going to have to say no to something you can't do everything be everywhere commit to everything and still see a straight path come in your life you've got to make a decision and stop choosing option a b c and d when life is not where you want it to be he's working it out for your good stop veering off the path the path is set direction is set path is set it's already there the question is do you know the path the second point i want to get you to is that there is a plan in play whether you know it or not god has already declared a plan he's already set it up it's already in motion the question is are you going to get in the game god has already spoken or god has already declared he's already speaking it my question is are you going to get in the game or are you going to sit on the sideline and say i'm good just where i am you are god's star player and god is waiting for you to get in the game god is waiting for you to do more than what you're doing god is waiting for you to commit greater than you're committing god is saying put both feet in and stop being one foot out and one foot in pastor you don't know my schedule i know that your path is probably not straight because a straight path doesn't go in multiple directions question today is are you going to jump in plans the plan is in play y'all the plan is this is happening and some of us this is what we're doing this is what social media does it makes us sit on the bench and watch everyone else look at their life they look amazing wow i wish i was doing that i gotta step my game up you don't have to step your game up to anyone all you have to do is play your game [Music] tell your neighbor real quick say play your game when they hire in basketball they don't hire all point guards they don't hire all one position the problem is it's too many of us are trying to play the exact same position what you doing cause you look like you successful let me let me get over here i told my real estate agent i said listen i might be over there soon the waiter pandemic running i might be over there i might need some help the lord said how about you just play your position how about you say where you at how about you do what you're called to do because you do it really well how about you figure out your position well i don't know what my position is that's where we got to go back and start and say lord what's the position i'm supposed to be playing because i'm doing everywhere we shooting we dunking we blocking we're not we're not even passing it's like this is my own game god's like no no no you're in a gang with people somebody like i'll do church by myself god's like that's not even how i called it i called you to a church i called you to a community you're out there playing by yourself basketball in the court talking about i'm amazing the problem is is you haven't gotten on the court with anybody else to make you better so as long as you keep playing yourself you will always promote yourself but you need to get in the court with some real players some folk who then walk through some stuff some folk whose marriages have been through some stuff so folk that experienced some grief some folk that have dealt with addiction you need to get with some people that's been in the game and stop running your own game by yourself [Applause] because you in the back talking about i'm amazing i'm killing it and the problem is is that you've been quitting when you want to quit because you're not playing in the game you're playing for practice you need the pressure of the game you need the pressure of being in where god's called you to you need the pressure of somebody holding you accountable you need to pressure somebody looking in your eyes and saying you need to do more you're doing only a little bit you need to get up and succeed further you need some folk that's looking at you like get your head in the game but the problem is is again we still playing on our own backyard we start when we want we quit when we want and we keep looking at ourselves saying i'm the best the problem is is you're the best in your arena and god is calling for you to be in the midst with people who've exceeded and gone beyond and seen god do face steps and you're trusting god with only natural miracle healings uh uh that that can come out of a bottle and god said if you got with me i could tell you god healed me and it was miracle and i can tell you that god delivered me through my addiction and i to tell you that god help me stop smoking i can tell you that god help me put my marriage back together but the problem is is you've been playing with yourself all too long you got your own game going on you're not experiencing what god wants to use you to do here's why i want to say we're called the mixes because we have the opportunity to recognize that god has placed us among some people who look different who act different who speak different who have a different perspective but i tell you this they can grow you up they can put you in the right frame of mind they can get you to get out of your own way they can help you become the man and the woman god has called for you to be to be the young person god has called for you to be i'm here today to let you know your dreams without support will stay where they are [Applause] without the right people around you stay where you're at and here's what you'll do you'll play in your own backyard and never impact anyone else's life but yourself and even you will get tired of you just wake up like what are we doing who are you talking to me that's what i do in the mirror my wife be in a room sleep i'll be in the bathroom i'll be talking up a storm why would you wake up 15 minutes early we said last night wake up at five o'clock you woke up at 5 15. what's your problem he's untying you to connect with some people you would never connect with to be with some people you would never be with to know some people you would never know if you would just untie your heart heart if you were untied oh i don't need anybody else if you were untie your unforgiveness if you would untie this god could take you but the problem is it's not more prayer it is more god god i need more of you i need i need you to do more in me the bible lets us know in jeremiah 29 11 we love this scripture the bible tells us it says for i know the plans i have for you declare the lord plans of prosperity and not for disaster to give you a future and give you a hope hallelujah that's how we do thank you jesus the problem is you'll never know the plans without him so you can quote the scripture but never receive the blessing it's not the re-quoting that gets us to the purpose it is the living it out by faith that walks us into where god has called for us to be and our last point point number three is the future is waiting can i tell somebody today today that a future is waiting for you a future that looks different than the familiar that you've been in that you've grown up in that has been the example of your life a future is waiting for you today the
