[Music] and i welcome you my name is marcus england lee pastor hear this church and i'm so grateful that you are a part of what god is doing if i can say this to you today is is that for those of you that are followers of jesus christ being in tune to this moment is so important because what the moment does is bring something supernatural in power that at times when you don't have the strength of your own self it is the uplifting part that gives you what you need when you don't have what you need and today i can tell you that some of us spiritually mentally and emotionally we don't have what we need but god is here to provide everything that you need somebody say today and so if you're in the position and you're like man i'm trying to get with it because i'm gonna tell you today worship they ministered in this place better than you reacted [Music] they they moved in this place better than we better than better than we were lifting our hands in worship i'm here to tell you that god wants to do something in his place and you still have an opportunity to capture what the lord is wanting to do if your expectation isn't just attendance if your expectation is that god wants to do something for you today if you didn't just log in for attendance sake today i am here to let you know that god wants to do something in you supernaturally that will bring about what his word says he'll give you peace in the midst of the storm he will give you joy beyond your even understanding he will bring clarity to your mind today so what i want you to allow is for why you are still in this moment forgot to be able to do everything that he needs to do in your life today and i'm believing that y'all we're coming off of 21 days of prayer and fasting if god has done anything for you i want you to celebrate what god is doing and it's already doing anybody grateful for what god has done over the last 21 days i am believing it i'm telling you i've gotten testimonies on god opening doors i've gotten testimonies on healing i've gotten testimonies on god opening jobs for people who didn't even think they would get them i'm here today to let you know the lord is moving and if he isn't moving in your life telling you i'm telling you right now you haven't positioned yourself properly for the lord to move and i want to talk about that today is positioning and so i am grateful for you being here today i am grateful uh because today mixed group directories are open and [Music] and you can get into a mixed group somebody say a mixed group now what is a mixed group it is a community that we find within the local church that helps us define the freedom that god has for our life because what we understand is that you cannot discover purpose without finding freedom the blockage to your purpose is what you lag in your freedom and so we're called together to be together as community to find freedom that god has for us and i want to let you know god doesn't want you to find it on your own he has put people that are constructed together to be a part of your life to help you see the destiny that god has for you so you want to be a part of it you want to get into a group now and you want to be able to be available because groups start next week and you want to get into that listen open your bibles we're going to jump into the word of god we're in joshua chapter one today and we've been talking through our series the crossover and i believe there is a you inside of you that you have never seen before that god is unleashing there's a part of you that you've never seen there's things inside of you giftings inside of you that you have never seen manifest the way that god wants them but i'm here today to let you know that you are in a church that believes that the manifested gifts that are on the inside of you that in which god has planted for your life is here today to be able to be revealed and opened and discovered as we just sing so that the church of the lord jesus christ can be sent out into the world to make an impact in the difference on the lives of those that are around you and so today i believe that we're called to take possession tell your neighbor it's time to possess it's time to possess joshua chapter one we only have three verses that we're going to read i want you to pull out your bible i want you to pull out your notes because god is speaking to you today and i want you to be able to hear what the lord has to say for we say no takers or what joshua chapter one after the death of moses the servant of the lord the lord said to joshua the son of nun moses's assistant i want you to recognize his position moses assistant god not only was speaking to moses but he was speaking to moses assistant it says moses my servant is dead now therefore somebody say arise and then someone say go over this jordan you and all this people into the land i am giving to them to the people of israel and verse three says and every place somebody needs to declare that somebody needs to underline that someone needs to highlight that for this year it says every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon i have given past tense not i will give not it is forthcoming he says i have given to you just as i promised to moses the title of the message that we want to come from today is positioned for possession positioned for possession let's pray father in the name of jesus we are believing that in this moment right now you are positioning us for that in which you have already declared over our life father we are asking that you would speak life into this moment that we have some of us feel defeated some of us feel disconnected from you some of us feel god that we haven't heard a word from you today but father i pray through your word that we would hear what thus saith the lord today for we love you honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much y'all y'all know i love to celebrate the people that are in this house and that make it happen can y'all help me celebrate our volunteers our dream team that's making it happen in this place i'm grateful for it i'm grateful for it i don't know if you know like i know but there are moments in your life that you were excited about what was ahead and sometimes things don't go always as the way that you planned if i can tell you to be honest about it there are some stories that i have in my life where i prayed i asked the lord i was being on my best behavior y'all know how it is we when we when we need something for the lord we straighten up and we fly right yeah i get what i'm saying we we get our lives together because i need a blessing from the lord and so that blessing that i need from the lord i get my life together i get myself i try to be as good as possible but oftentimes it has nothing to do with how good we are it has everything to do with how good god is never forget leaving out of middle school and going into high school i had the aspirations of being a musician and i never forget being in the place where i i was so excited about what god was doing in my life i was so excited about the next stage of my life that i said lord i know what i want to be right now i want to be a musician i want to play the drums professionally anybody remember the dreams that you had going into high school anybody remember that what the aspirations that you had moving into the next part of your life and i'll never forget i signed up to go to the baltimore school for the arts and i got my audition papers and and and i'll never forget i was ready y'all i was ready to get in i i loved the school i loved what it had to offer i loved that i could be doing what i wanted to do all the days and all the time and and so i never forget getting there getting into position and getting into the space where i was like i'm ready to possess anybody ever been there before you were confident you knew everything that you're about to do you are on your way to make it happen and i i didn't know about the word possession but i was ready to possess and i'll never forget they called me and said let's get you into a room and we want you to do some things for us now i i i love drums i had played in church and to everybody else i thought i could really play but y'all haven't noticed you think you can do something really well until you actually get around some folk that can really do it well and and it kind of let you know a little bit about yourself without letting you know a little bit about yourself and god kind of reminds you you got a little bit more to go than you thought you did and i'll never forget i got into the room and and they said all right we want you to do a a a a couple of exercises and so we want to see some single flams and we want to see a couple of paradiddles and and and if you can uh add the flams with the paradiddles uh we would gradually appreciate it and i said well what are you talking about i've never heard of this before is there not a drum set that you have because i can really play a drum set like i do at church if you want to see me do it but but all of this new stuff that you're talking about i don't really know what you're talking in reference to and so i wasn't prepared for what i thought i wanted to walk into and had i gotten in the school i probably would have been so behind that they would have to catch me up to get to the place where i wanted to be now oftentimes when you feel god is saying no you don't understand his no but i want to let you know god's no is the best no that you could ever receive because it's a no of protection it's a no of understanding the future steps that he has for you and you don't know how god is always setting you up so i want to let you know when you're asking god for an answer in your time of prayer don't be scared of a no because a no is an answer to keep you out of the wrong path that you're not supposed to go down i want to say that to you because oftentimes we think prayer is the format in which we create relationship and develop a request before god that puts us in position to receive what we want to receive but the idea and understanding that god knows greater than i already know because the creator knows what the creation needs god's no and yeses are both good and amen the bible in jeremiah 29 11 lets us know there is a good plan that god has for us it has hope and it has somebody say a future it has a future so in order to preserve the future that has already been planned and is already waiting for you god must say no to some of the things that you want a yes too we might not like that too often because oftentimes i think i know the best plan for my life do i got any folks in here that think you know you think you know the best plan you have for your life you believe you you got it all together you know where you're supposed to go i've been doing this thing for a long time see that's the thing that i thought i have been playing drums for all of a long time of about five years and it makes me a professional at knowing what i want to do there are some things that god has placed in your life that you have not been called to do as a purpose but as preparation and there are some places that you have mistaken because you have received success out of it that you have created as a career and it was only supposed to be a temporary season how many things have we attached ourselves to because it brought the fulfillment and the success that we needed to be able to make us feel good instead of us becoming who god called for us to be every good thing is not your thing everything that you are doing doesn't mean it's the thing you were called to do some things are position holders to get you to the next step of what god has for your life i didn't understand that god was positioning me for the space that i was in so had i gotten into that school and had i gotten into the place where i went professionally i probably would not try to be in the position that i'm in because i would have been so focused on my own will instead of the will of god so some of god's nose all of god's nose are the nose to get you back on track say somebody i got to get back on track because everything that you're doing that's showing results does not mean it's what god has called for you to do some of us are in place holders when we should be in purpose movers and your placeholder that you're in has been the security that you've been using in order for god to be able to not necessarily work in a scary way in your life because in order to really move out of a placeholder it requires faith in things that you cannot see which means you cannot plan the next step without god speaking in your life you can still be a great christian but yet stay right where you are and some of us have planted our feet so well in our religion that we don't have that much a relationship can i speak this to somebody in here today just because it's working out doesn't mean it's supposed to work for you anybody ever been there before where something came with instructions you put it together but then it lost a component and you tried to find a replacement that didn't go with the actual set of what you had but it held it together just enough so that you could still operate it some of us are using spare parts spare pieces of our life that we have gotten so good at that we've put it into place of where our lives are currently that the way we're operating is that it's good enough to hold it together but it's not what god intended for our life so some of us are operating out of some places that no longer need to be put together we need to summon tell somebody real quick you just got to let it go there's some areas in your life where you got to let it go you pastor it still works there's nothing wrong with it the problem is is that there's something wrong with it because it's not yours and you're living a placeholder life with a prepared destiny that's already set out for you i'm here today to let you know is that god has something destined for your life can i tell you this if you are still breathing today you should be asking god what do you have for my life god is not here to keep you on earth so that you do not have to suffer the pain of losing your life he is not here so that you are just occupying the space because everybody around you needs you because if they you weren't around they wouldn't know what to do i'm here today to let you know you would be mourned i'm here today to let you know you would be uh uh felt as you left this earth but god would make a way just like he's made a way for you for those that you've lost here's why i want to let you know moses was considered one of the greatest prophets ever one of the greatest to lead the children out of egypt he was the greatest to lead millions he was the greatest to part the red sea he was the greatest to call manna and quail from heaven he was the greatest but god said when you're not in order with me when you're no longer in alignment with what i'm in alignment with guess what i have always a substitute in the plan for what i have for this world the bible lets us know that joshua was an assistant to moses he was an assistant to moses nobody likes the word assistant that's why we put words like executive in front of it it makes you feel better i'm a lead executive assistant to the president of the company what does that mean you're an assistant [Music] but i'm over all the other assistants [Applause] but i'm an assistant the problem is is that we have framed ourselves to care so much about how we're viewed instead of caring about the season and process of what god is doing in us we're more looking for people to view us in a way than learning the lesson that god is trying to pull out of us so that he can set us up for the next level of where we're called to be that's why positions and position descriptions are so needed for us because we need to know not just what our job is but we need to know how people are supposed to see us joshua i don't think ever got the position uh uh executive pastor over israel they just knew he was what moses's assistant when moses went to the top of the mountain joshua was at the bottom waiting for moses he didn't have a position name i never heard anybody call him the second in charge in the bible he was just available for whatever god wanted to use him to do and i'm here today to let you know in a society where we are so consumed with someone knowing who we are instead of understanding that god is forming us and he's making us and he's changing us if you could just be an assistant if you could just be okay where god has you and in tune to what god is doing in your life rather than where you're trying to get in your career or in your position in life god can say don't worry about what i'm going to do with you next just worry about where i have you somebody say right now you need to be more consumed with your right now and what god is doing in this season of your life than being consumed about where you can get to if you can manage now you can see the results of your future the problem is we're managing a future that we don't have a control over or even an understanding of yet because we're so consumed in what will be that we're not recognizing who we are you got to worry about the you today to think about where you're going tomorrow the bible lets us know that when when moses would even come out of the temple the bible says that he would come out with a veil but it lets us know when he was praying joshua was still in the temple worshiping before god see what i've learned is that the lord is always building us to a place so that when it comes time for the season of releasing to your life you can handle what he's releasing without having to give it back or ask for it again my question that i wrote down which was important to me is how's your positioning right now how how well are you positioned for what god wants to answer or are you positioned in a place that if god did say yes you would actually have the ability to do what he's calling you to do the reason why positioning is so important is because when you position yourself you're available for god to do whatever he wants to do now i want to tell you what you're praying for you need to be positioned for what you're praying for you need to be positioned for god i want healing are you taking care of your body for the healing because some of us are asking for healing in areas we're not taking care of lord heal my body lower your blood pressure god heal my body eat better no i want the healing without the preparation which means god says if i heal it it'll get right back to where it is because you haven't positioned yourself for the changes that need to be made so that we can do what god is asking us to do so i would rather do it my way and then ask god to keep coming back to do a miracle instead of working in god's stead for him to do what he's calling to do financially are you positioned to receive increase because you know how to steward what you have it's good why you keep clapping because it's good it's good it's good stuff it's good stuff when you tell god you are so busy for everything else and everything he's called you to in his work yet you're asking him to give you more so that you can manage it in the time you don't have you're not positioned properly if somebody's asking you to do something but you never have the time to do it why would god give you increase in something you're praying for when you're not available for him as of now anyway god expand my territory i can't because you don't have time to expand minds we ever been there before because the context is god is trying to see your availability level even with what you already have you can't ask for more territory if you cannot handle the territory you currently have are you positioned my question is the marriage is not as healthy as you want it to be god bring clarity god change our hearts god do something new the question is are you positioned for god to do something in your marriage or in your relationship or are you too busy with work that you don't have time forgot to work the marriage out so you're not positioned for an answer [Applause] i'm just interested and are you positioned to handle what you want to yes for i wasn't positioned to handle the requirements of the baltimore school for the arts that's why i did not get in and sometimes we have scars in our lives from god's nose because we didn't understand how out of position we were to receive what he was calling us to receive the first clarity of what i want to ask you is are you positioned properly the idea is i have to position myself properly why because people are telling me that i can do anything the church is telling me you can do anything if you put your mind to it the the world is telling me you can do anything if you put your mind to it the places are telling me i can do anything i can put my mind to it pastor you keep quoting the scripture he's able to do exceeding abundantly above more than he can ask a thing if you have the proper position some of you are praying about your children god i need you to help my child to get clarity and understanding god says you want me to do the work of parenting that you don't have time to do for yourself so you want me to fix your children when you haven't positioned yourself to build relationships we want god to do what we're absent to put ourselves in position to receive some of us god is not interested in denying you he's just waiting for you to be positioned the question is whatever you're asking god for are you in position to receive what it is he's saying single people you want somebody you want to dance with somebody you really want to be with somebody hey i need somebody to love me my question today though are you positioned it's it's not even about you being so financially fit is your mind positioned to work towards the work that comes with building the family it's not just about do i have all of the resources it's about am i mentally positioned to make some changes in my life that will allow the relationship to get to where it can be am i positioned to receive because we're praying for things we're not positioning ourselves for because we're too interested in having a good marriage instead of working on one that's why we have posts that say relationship goals financial goals how are you going to have a financial goal and you not saving how are you going to have a financial goal to receive abundance but you're not generous or giving can i speak this to some of you some of us are saying we want to live generously and we have every opportunity to live generously yet every moment we do something for somebody we're expecting to be compensated you know they ain't give me no gas money i took them down the street and they ain't give me no gas money what you want three dollars too like i know gas went up but [Music] i'm speaking in the frame that we want to learn generosity but we're always looking for somebody to give to us without the ability of saying you know what i don't even need that my mom is one who is notorious at really working at a certain area in my spirit and i can say this very clearly [Music] because i tell her you never ever have to worry about giving me anything for anything i do for you ever sweetheart i got gas money mom if you don't put that money away it rises up something on the inside of me sweetie you know you don't have to i i'm not even asking this is what you are developing and who god is making me to be so actually what you're doing is offense to me because it makes me feel like i haven't shown you that i have the spirit of generosity that you wouldn't even consider it can i tell you that some of us are walking around with the mindset that we're generous but people know you're expecting something for everything you do you know i'm a cash app you 20 no no i don't need it no i'm a cash at you okay well thank you you better hit refund like you don't have any other choice while they sent it to me i have to no refund it back no i don't need it i'm good i'm just waiting on god to bless me i don't need that i'm good why because god is trying to position you to learn what it is the lesson that he has because oftentimes while i'm in the baltimore school for the arts thinking that i have enough of what i need to get to where i'm going i don't recognize i'm still out of position of where i need to be so god has to still train me and show me where to go hard message to get but i promise you you could get further if you were positioned to possess point number one that i want you to know is that you're called to be faithful in somebody say the small things small things let me tell you what the small things are it's the things that you see that you ignore i know i shouldn't spend this money but i got enough so i'ma spend it i should clean this house but you know i don't feel like cleaning it today so i'll just leave it right where it's at let me tell you the biggest place of neglect in the small things of your life you neglect the blessings you prayed for give me the job two weeks later i'm sick of working here i'm coming in late no no no no can we can we get this real i'm coming in late i'm not doing what they're asking i'm complaining about everything that they're doing well you don't know my boss my boss is against me no no no you have a greater boss so all you need to do is what god told you to do not be so concerned with what they are doing to you because they have no control over you but we aren't faithful over the somebody say small things the scripture is letting us know that you've got to be faithful in luke chapter 16 verse 10 it says the one who faithfully manages little he has been given will be somebody say promoted and trusted with greater responsibilities but those who cheat with the little they have been given will not be considered trustworthy to receive more you don't have more because you're not managing what you have now i want more friends manage the ones you have now without using them for what they have i want greater relationships be vulnerable in the ones you have so that you can get a return of vulnerability instead of acting like you've got it all together manage the small can i tell you manage the small manage the friendship maybe it will move to something else manage what you have some of us come in without any management skills just to possess and you're totally out of position to receive what god has for you manage the small things whatever it is that you don't have time enough for is the very thing that you will not see the increase in because you don't have the mindset to manage the small things pastor i can't give my tithing pastor i can't give to what god has done pastor i can't even be able to be generous why because you have not learned how to manage the small things somebody say the small things you got to learn to manage the small things you got to learn to manage how to not look for what you can get but how you can somebody say give manage small things manage the one child before you start asking for another talking about these kids running me crazy yes because you don't have a plan to manage what you have whatever you don't have a plan to manage will run you beyond what you have the ability to have the capacity to hold together you want people to be committed to you but you can't commit to people manage small things number two be open to hear god the bible lets us know that joshua was coming out of the season of mourning matter of fact he has to get joshua's attention because joshua is still in the space of mourning why is this important because god does not only speak in comfortable moments sometimes when you're praying god is speaking about a prayer not that you're praying now but that a prayer that you were praying before god was opening the door for joshua to take the next step even in the middle of joshua being in pain and mourning we only think that god is speaking only about the situation that we're currently in and god is still on his promises because his work cannot go back void can i tell you that even though it may not be perfectly where you want it to be still listen for the voice of god not for only what you're trying to get out of but for also understanding what you prayed and asked god for before because god wants to speak about things that you have on what the main line they used to say back in the day jesus on the main line tell them what you want some of us forgot what we wanted and became so obsessed with where we are that we don't recognize that god is answering what you needed and still need in a season where you feel without lack why is that important because god can bless you with the past blessing that is in the right season to fulfill and help with the mourning and the season that you're in you're hurting from a relationship now when god is trying to sing you friendships from before and you're telling god how many of you have said this it's not the right time you're trying to declare your own timing not understanding god's season can you imagine joshua wanted to say lord it's not right time right now moses your servant is dead i got a lot of weight and burden on me right now it's a lot that i gotta do this thing is heavy on my life i love when people say i'll get back to you to let you know because right now it's not the best timing for me that means you actually don't understand what god's timing has said about what you need in the season you're in you feel that your breakthrough now is more important than what god's trying to do from your past season he said to him all i'm trying to do is fulfill the promise i gave to moses in your season you can be so consumed with you that you don't understand that god is fulfilling something generationally that he already spoke in the season you're in and god is not worried about what you want in the season he's worried about making sure he fulfills his promise that he already declared so you could be in the season that it is not beneficial for you but totally beneficial for god the question is will you deny your comfort for god's promise man this is this is not a good this is not a good week for me this is not a good week for me this is this is the week where i do god's like no no this is the week where you do this and we're like no no no i do that every other week but don't forget your requests for god to do more that god is saying you're not positioned to handle more so i won't give you more because you haven't recognized that i want to be able to form and do something through you in you and for you whenever i want to description psalms 91-15 says this when they call on me i will answer i will be with them in trouble and i will rescue and rescue and honor them while you're in rescue god can promote you while you're in seasons of sadness god can bring seasons of glory and joy at the same time we think when we're sad we're sad god no blessings right now and the lord is saying that's not how it works you'll be trying to figure out why you happy when everything is going the wrong way because god is saying i positioned you properly so that in this season where you were going to be without hope i was giving you hope to come point number three somebody say number three possess what you have access to stop possessing things that god did not give you the bible told joshua what the territory was if you go further in the description it says i've given you the land to hear i've given you canaan i've given you this i'm giving you that i've given you this area and i'm giving you that area and wherever the soul of your foot shall tread that in which i've given already unto you here's the thing as i promised to moses here's what we've got to understand there is something that has been appropriated to you because you have the ability to carry it stop walking outside of the territory of what god has not given you so that you take on stress you were never meant to take on and walk in the territory that god is giving you is your territory hard yes it is but guess what it's minds which means god has done everything uh inside of me through me and for me to prepare me for what he's giving me you are in a season somebody said possession i just got to be positioned properly i just got to know where i'm going i got to know the place where i'm going to be i got to understand that god has caught me to this moment today i'm understanding why god has placed limits on certain people because they're not ready for it you're too tired for it you're too sleepy for it can i tell you some of your prayers are outside of your boundary because you haven't opened your capacity you want it mentally you don't have it inwardly you don't have it because you haven't positioned yourself can i tell you there are some places where hard work is not about what god is asking he's asking about stewardship of your time of your resources of where you are going today and you're thinking more work and god is saying i'm not asking for more work i'm asking for more space remember i said just because you believe you're good at it doesn't mean that's what he's called you to so you have to pray in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path today you need god to direct your path not your interest you need god to direct your path where you can get to to discern where you're able to go because i'm here today to let you know if you're falling off on every other area god is saying you're just not ready yet so what i'm telling you at the end of these 21 days is to receive what you've been praying for you've got to position yourself to have it stop putting the work on god and position yourself to receive all that god has for you somebody say today and i'm believing that god will give you the ability to possess everything that he has called you to can we celebrate the lord in this place today [Applause] i want to pray for you and pray over you because i believe you're in the space of possession but it's about a mindset it's about a place in which you are to change and connect there's some realities that you've got to come to realize to say lord have i done enough time as an assistant for you to be able to do in me what you want to do for me father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that if we're not in position we want to be in position if you can position us to possess our destiny our call our purpose lord help us to not be restrained to what we see with our eyes but by faith to know that you have greater for us no matter the season that we're in god whatever it is you are speaking to us and we need your words god we open our hearts to you not to just be hearers of this word but to be doers of what you've called us to for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name
