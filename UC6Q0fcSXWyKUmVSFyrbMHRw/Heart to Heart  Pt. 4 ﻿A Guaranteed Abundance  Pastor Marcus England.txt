[Music] thank you we celebrate God in this place come on can you help me celebrate God in this place come on can you help me celebrate God in this place I'm gonna wait on you cause we're not going no further without the presence of the Lord so can you help me celebrate God in this place can we acknowledge the presence of God in this place can we give God the praise that is due unto his name in this place can you magnify the Lord with me and can we exalt his name somebody say let's do this thing together [Music] oh my God I just heard you I'll say this praise belongs to God but I'm I'm here to let you know is that there is a praise in this place that can unshackle the burden and the weight that's upon your life for the Bible says that we can trade the Garment of heaviness for the spirit of praise and I just believe that when you know Monday's coming in and you know what you've got to deal with and you know the work that you've got to handle I think that if I could just get a little bit off of my neck just a little bit of weight off of my shoulders and I could give God the praise the Bible says I can trade the Garment of heaviness for the spirit of Praise so I just seen about 10 people who want to make a trade right now and don't want to carry this Garment of heaviness I dare you right now just to give God a five second phrase right in this place right now God I traded for praise if that's you just tell your neighbor real quick I feel free tell somebody else on the other side I feel free tell your third choice I know you might be my third choice but I feel free come on let's give God one more praise in this place God bless you on your way down to your seat just tell somebody it's good to see you it's good to see you welcome to the mix my name is Marcus England I am the lead Pastor here and I'm grateful for what God is doing one thing I want to let you know is that we are a church that believes in the presence of what God can do supernaturally you're not about to enter into a TED Talk you're not about to enter into a motivational speech you are about to hear the words of the true and living God the Bible says through those words lives can be changed and I believe today that as you hear these words these words can change the very nature of Who You Are but there must be a requirement on your end you must be in expectation for whatever you're expecting God to do I want to let you know God can can somebody say today and I believe when we are in expectation and we are ready for God to move and speak God will do just that tell somebody around you I'm ready tell somebody else on the other side I'm ready tell your third choice third choice I'm ready I am ready I'm ready to do this we're excited about the word of God and we are in week four of our series heart to heart and I am grateful for what God is doing in my heart and I want to jump into the scripture the word of God today in second Corinthians chapter nine can you get out your Bible can you get out your notes uh this is an opportune time for us to hear from God and I believe when we position ourselves to hear the Bible says that he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit has to say to the church and I believe because God is speaking to his church today second Corinthians chapter nine we're going to read verses six to eight and then we're going to jump to verse 10 and read verse 10 and 11. and it starts and it says this the point is this you ever want to get just directly to the point start right here the point is this [Music] whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully each one must give as he has decided in his somebody say heart not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves for God loves for God loves if you ever want to know what God loves the Bible speaks it right here God loves a cheerful somebody say cheerful giver and verse 8 gives us an understanding of what happens as we're looking to trust in the Lord it says and God is able I could stop right there because many of you have a testimony that in the darkest nights and in the darkest hours when you felt like you were by yourself and you felt there was no one else there you had to remember that God is somebody say Abel to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times there must have been important to the Apostle Paul that he kept putting in all having all things having all sufficiency in all things at all times you may abound in every good work verse 10 he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply somebody say Supply and multiply say it one more time Supply and multiply your seed not anybody else to see not your neighbors see your seeds for sowing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness last verse and it says you will be not you might be not you may be not you could be you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way which through us will produce Thanksgiving to God I want to come from a title today a guaranteed abundance a guaranteed abundance let's pray father I pray in this moment that you would guarantee and abundance in Jesus name amen I think it's important as we're talking Heart to Heart that we understand that there are principles that God has placed in his word for us to gain understanding and Clarity and knowledge of that help us to walk the kingdom walk that God has called us to here is what the Bible lets us know is that we have either operated in a one or two kings in the kingdom of darkness or in the Kingdom of Light I want to let you know today if you've given your life to Jesus Christ you have made the change from the kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of Light and I'm telling you today you've made the best choice but here's the thing about change I say this a lot but I truly do believe it is that oftentimes we want change without change [Music] we love the idea of change just as long as you don't change it but keep it the same it can change around me I just don't need it to change in me I want people to change if you've ever been there before you look at people around you and you start to assess because we're such Grace great assessors we're not judgers we're just assessors we don't judge people we just assess people as we assess people we look around and we tell just change everything would be all right the problem is is change is hard can anybody admit that change is hard when you're in a certain place in life where you have gotten used to a way that things are changed can be difficult changing from where you are to where you want to be can be difficult because you begin to lay down your preference for the purpose that God has established the issue that we had though is oftentimes you've ever like got to change something for you but you're a little reluctant for God to change something in you you want God to change your relationship but you don't want to change the way that you yelling you want to change that the person would be more and more connected to you but you don't want to change that you actually need to have a conversation with them most of the time we want change around us we're just not willing to do change within us and we ask and pray and say Lord can you change it can you change my spouse can you change my job can you change my money can you change my friends and God says if I start with you is that okay and you say no no no Lord no no no no no no no no let's not start with me because I'm not the major problem the major problem is around me the major problem is the person that doesn't really know how to talk to me the way they should talk to me so I need you to change them it's it's the person that doesn't understand the pressures of life that I'm coming from I need you to change them not change me because changing me means I have to identify that there's something imperfect about who I am and if I have to identify that there's something imperfect about who I am the thing is is I must come to a space that I gotta say that I'm not perfect but the problem is is most of us understand we live in perfection we are perfect you you do you see who I am I but God made it's not me it's still taking your neighbor real quick it's not me it's them they got the bad attitude they're always angry they're the ones always running at the mouth they're the ones who gossip and God turns to you and said but you're the one with the ear [Applause] L it was talking about you you know I ain't say nothing but um see that's the problem the problem is Jesus is Calling no I'm just playing no the problem the problem is is that we can always see everyone else is wrong instead of seeing ours because As we judge I'm sorry use the wrong word as we assess people we assess them based on our Perfections and the assessment that where we are and where we're going is the road to righteousness and everyone else around us is failing the broken problem with this is that my aunt is trying to change because a change you makes decisions about the broken people that are around you if you're in broken friendships it's because you're gaining something from the Brokenness of that friendship I want to help you real quick we don't do anything that we don't get a reward from right right I'm gonna let that sit we don't do anything we don't because it makes us feel good whether it's bad or not and the reason is is because even in our Brokenness there's a pleasure that we get that oftentimes we don't want to give up even though we want change we just don't want to change us and the idea behind it is that change requires work and work requires that I see myself and if I see myself there's a possibility that someone else sees me as well hmm then there's a possibility The Narrative that I've been telling everybody for how well I look on the outside how much I keep it together how much I post to make you understand that my life is amazing that in between the event and me living it's not as pretty as you think it is and if I could be in a moment where I could understand that in John 10 and 10 Jesus said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly somebody say abundant but you would have it's abundant but the problem is is that abundance isn't afford it to the person who's not willing to express that they're not there yet the question is do you think you're there more than you do think you're there and what are you willing to do to change the place that you want to be and that you're not in right now that you've anchored yourself in that you've convinced yourself through worldly measures that you're fine where you are Jesus is oftentimes giving a story and a lesson about what it is to live out principles because principles are something concrete that we can live off of instead of the made-up realities that we put in our head anybody know that you live in your own world where you are the bomb you you you live in a world where you are right 95 of the time and the world around you is broken and wrong anybody know that all right I just want to say admit because if we can't start admitting we can't get change and the mindset Where We Are thing happening that you don't see my side of it and you don't understand so you're you don't get the right perspective and and you have lived and created this world around you where the job that you had the degrees that you had the the car that you drive the the things in your life that you have have sustained a mindset that I'm good where I am but the problem is really on the inside you feel deprived you feel like you don't understand you feel broken but on the outside you've convinced yourself that you're doing good because your accomplishments that you have created for yourself you have achieved but the problem is is that the place of your achievement is actually the lowest place of your purpose oh because you think you made it and God says here's the thing it's not hard for you to get the degree it's not hard for you to be successful it's not hard for you to be an amazing entrepreneur what's hard is for you to be humble and obedient [Applause] if I ask you how to really live out life you can tell me this is what you do this is how you say this is what your budget is this is where we go but the problem is is that Jesus is saying it's not about you understanding principles or applying principles he's saying there's something broken with your heart because while you are successful outwardly you're unsuccessful inwardly [Applause] and today I believe that you can live in abundance but abundance is not about what you have outwardly abundance is about what's taking place on the inside somebody say the inside let's get to the inside of the story the three things that I believe I'm not at the point yet don't get that happy hold on oh he's already all right all of us operate out of three levels the first one is the need level the second one is the greed level and the third one is the seed level I'll repeat that one more time for those of you that are taking notes the first is the need level the need level is the place where I understand I am in need of God to supply the needs that I cannot supply for myself it is the place where I put my posture into a place of God I need for you to do and to move in my life I don't have it in actuality and resource so I'm submitted to when you do it only because I don't have the resources to do it for myself it is the most humbling place yet it can be the most depressing place because you're waiting on God to provide those things that seem very basic to an average person you're waiting for God to move Lord will you do it right now you'll remember the name place I remember the need place I remember the need place because I remember when I got married and I remember going to the gas count I would look at it and I would say I've got twenty dollars in there I've got to figure out food gas and I gotta hold it on until I get paid now don't act like you don't know when it's time to get paid when you're counting down the days and and you're holding the quarters and you never knew you had so much change in your life thank you the problem is you got a little too bougie you looking at change and you're walking over it I don't do those I don't do change you get to the cash register they're trying to give you change back uh no I don't need it it's falling out I don't I don't need that weight on me give it give it here Excuse me give it apply that to my meal laughs and the idea behind it is in the knee level you have to trust God somebody say trust God you know what's happening at the knee is that God is trying to help you understand management at the knee level [Music] where management is a part of the principle of the Kingdom that God wants you to get it's not about making more it's about managing what you have somebody say now if I could learn the principle of managing what I have now I could understand that more is about adding two more isn't about covering what I already spent context to debt is that oftentimes we're getting in debt not to get more money we're getting in debt to prove to ourselves that we're worth something based off of what we have instead of being content somebody say content Where You Are when you're content where you are then you can operate out of what you have you're looking for a two-bedroom you have a paycheck for a studio we don't like that your bank account says Studio you're out here saying father I need you to move right now that's your prayer I need you to move in a way like never before I need the Gates of Heaven to open up what we want God to do is to jump the principle of management to give us a blessing that we're not prepared to handle and we're asking for prayer for management lack for God to supersede the principle of getting into something that now puts us into a broken place of debt it's just like the prayers we ask God Lord will you do more will you make more happen when more things take place and God says if I give you more can you manage what I give you [Applause] if you can manage what I give you then I can give you more to whom much is given much is required the problem is I know the principle yet I still act outside of it here's the thing about a miracle oh can I talk about a financial Miracle just really quick can I oh let me just let me help you with this real quick let me help you understand when you're in a place asking for a financial Miracle it means that you're at the place of your end that you no longer have the resources that you managed to get what you need for the next level the problem is is oftentimes I'm looking for a miracle from mismanagement [Music] [Applause] and we want God to move Heaven and Earth for what we cannot control within ourselves does this sound familiar you can apply this to anywhere else in your life but I want to let you know is that you're asking God for a blessing for the things you're not willing to manage good all right just getting a little testy in here but for abundance to whom much is given much shall be required at the grade level Mama we made it at the green level now we're at the place where we're not asking for more for what we can't afford we're asking for more for what we want not what we need Lord if you could listen listen this two-bedroom is cool but God I went on Redfin and I prayed over this light anybody got a Redfin spirit I don't know I don't want to put you out there I've got a Redfin spirit I walk past anything go I'm just ready for what is this how much what does this look like this is nice and we start asking God out of the great place Lord can I have more I mean this is a very easy system of principles that I want to help you because degree level says I don't need it I just want it here's the thing to get more of what you want God says you have to be responsible for what you have just tell your neighbor you got to be responsible you got to be responsible for what you have because here's the idea everything you have belongs to God is the one who gave it to you he's your provider he blessed you so he wants to know as I hand it over what do you do with it [Applause] tell your neighbor real quick it wasn't yours because if you knew it wasn't yours you would operate like it was someone else's and when you have an owe someone else money you're looking at the amount or the things that you have so you can make sure that you don't operate outside of the boundaries of what that person has said according to what you're supposed to do now to understand at the greed level is a level where you have more than you can ever want imagine or even thought and God is saying I'm willing to bless you but here's the thing about it at the greed level when I keep asking God for more and I don't understand the purpose of why he's given me more I found myself in the place where I'm not asking out of a need I'm asking out of agreed and then the last level is the seed level somebody say seed seed level sea level is the level where I understand all I'm here to do is manage what he's given me thing is a seed and from a seed grows what fruit from a seed grows what a even though God has afforded me this house the house is nothing but a what come on I want you to say that one on one again everything everything a seed that means a seed duplicates itself and moves into the place where it doesn't just rest with me a sea can do what multiply so there are three principles to sewing I want to help you you want to move out of the need level you don't want to live out of the greed level you want to operate from the seed level when you operate from the seed level here's what happens I'm going to break I'm gonna like I'm going to break your mind like just oh snap when you operate from the seed level you can stay in the purpose level because you don't have to go and find open land to sow in that's not yours to reap from when you're in the sea level you stay in your purpose and your purpose helps to be able to develop the value of what you need so that you can continue to produce out of purpose and not out of need see what happens is oftentimes when we don't see it as a seed we put it back into a place of need because now I'm no longer operating out of God what can you do with this seed I'm operating out of God how can I get more the problem isn't more the problem is is you won't let God do for the seed what needs to be done in the sea so let's talk about the three principles of sowing the first principle is you reap what you it's understandable but we don't think about that the problem is is in sowing you have to put into the ground that in which by faith you are hoping to come as to what Harvest the issue is as too many people want fruit before sowing anybody know how to sew anybody anybody ever planted anything before anybody ever been there before like you planted like I try to plant I have no green thumb my thumb is red purple or whatever other color but it's not green [Music] and when I when I planted before it takes a while for there to be a blooming of whatever it is that I'm sowing it even if it's already got a stem on it and it's been growing somewhere else when I repot it I have to y'all we had a whole thing I I thought I was trying to be uh uh Martha Stewart at our home I went out buying pots and dirt and I got Truckers coming loaded in y'all know you know like I'm like I'm building a forest and I don't have a forest it's right here it's a small and they're pulling it in and they're loading it and I'm like all right and the person says to me it's hot out because when conditions are rougher you need to what so more and to take care of it more because it's in a rougher season I go in there I start doing what I start sowing and I start good I gotta water it y'all I gotta anybody I gotta water it I had if I don't know I had to do all of this and I got a big one y'all this big plan and then I had three plants up top and then I had a plant on the side and then I had a plan on the other side and then I looked at myself and I was like that was pretty bright wasn't it and I don't have a water hose up front so you know what it required in order for the plant to grow the work of me going back and forth to water it every somebody say every day things don't grow without there being watering and tilling of the ground scripture lets us know in Genesis chapter 1 verse 11-12 it says this God said let the Earth grow plant life plants yielding seeds and fruit trees bearing fruit with what see seed begets fruit fruit begets seed seed begets fruit fruit begets more seed if I have seed I don't waste it I sow it and from whatever I sow the sowing becomes something that I now reap but I so what again scripture says plants yielding seeds fruit trees bearing fruit with seeds inside of it each according to its what somebody say It's Kind throughout the Earth and that's what happened the Earth produced plant life plants yielding seeds each according to its kind and trees bearing fruit with seeds inside of it each according to its kind and God's saw how good it was sufficiency and what God is sowing a seed into here's the problem many of us want to reap from a harvest we've never planted [Applause] foreign what if you just took a a drive out to a farm today just take your car out to a farm and you just go like pull over and you see like a corn field I dare you just go over there and start pulling it up all right corn man free coin I promise you you will hear shots you will hear dogs you will see an attack on your life because nobody wants someone else to steal the seed that they oh that's a moment right there listen if you know anything about how long and how hard it took for you to get where you are today and you would tell somebody your testimony if you understood what we went through in the early part to get to where we are baby I did not get this out of luck I just need to breach for two seconds real quick I didn't get this out of luck didn't nobody give it to me as a handoff I work for this thing you see where my mind I will cuss you out but it's Bob the grace of God some therapy and some good people in my life that I haven't slapped you already upstairs [Music] William B Moore you you can act surprise all you want oh my God the pastor say that yeah he did cause I know you can act nice to the people around you Let It Go less I'm just saying now you may have a couple more tries I might not get as quick as you but I got a point too and if Jesus don't keep you don't know how long I've been working on who I am so I will not let anyone steal my seed of Joy I will not let anyone steal my seed of Liberty I will not let you tell me that send in that somebody gave it to me I work for this thing I put time into this thing I cried I fasted I put labor into it you're not gonna tell me this is a free thing this thing is by gods but you read what you sow [Applause] the Bible says that things multiply after their kind I could leave that right there I could tell you that there's some things in your life that you're seeing external generational because the seed bears fruit to its kind I'm just going to leave that there can't be like best what you talking about I'm gonna leave it there it bears fruit to its kind what do you see around you that you don't like that people speak to that you keep saying I don't see it and everybody's like we see it because you bear what you are when we understand that God says he is sufficient in all things we need to understand that if we want to see something change we have to change the kind of seed that we've been sowing can I tell somebody today if you don't like what you see then it's time for you to go in and dig that root up [Music] and pull out what you don't want to see and say I don't care if my parents did it I'm not doing it I don't care if that was their mindset it's not going to be my mindset I don't care if that's a generational thing in my family I'm some tell somebody I'm digging it up today I don't know where you are but I got to dig that thing up today I got to listen I don't know where this depression comes from but I got to dig this thing up today I got to find a room and anybody I got to find the root of what this thing is because seeds bear their kind stop praying the devil off of everything that you put them on [Applause] I bind Satan How You Gonna bind Satan when you entered him in oh the problem that we get is that we are begetting what we beget my children are ungrateful where they getting it from oh oh no no don't clap no you'll have to do that that'd be the ones that's not the parents mm-hmm parents like uh I didn't teach that oh you didn't teach that by getting them everything they wanted when they didn't deserve to get it but you put them on punishment but you took punishment off so that they could get it but you want them to be grateful that you took it off that they didn't learn the lesson that they were supposed to learn so but you want them to be grateful from the lesson that you never taught all you did was beget what you did man we need to get our youth together yeah okay cool great yeah we do yep yep let's get our youth together you want to go with me and go to outreach so that we can talk to our youth pastor right now [Music] the seed of busyness I don't have the time God says great okay cool you're too busy that's fine I'll just be too busy to use you so now you just beget complaining we need to change the world we can't you're too busy because here's the thing you can't march once it happens when you weren't doing anything about it that was good but the problem is is you sow the seed of nothing so you're reaping the seed of nothing y'all gonna find another church next week that's what y'all look like I'm out of here as soon as he get to that point I am out of here can I tell you that where you are is a byproduct of what you sowed [Applause] sparingly does what re sparingly whoever sows bountifully reaps what that's the principle the question is what did you sow can I tell somebody in here you didn't sew at the top and so you're seeing the fruit of it now so now you need to over so bountifully so that you can reap the Harvest that you actually want to see my kids aren't close to me that's because y'all aren't talking at the beginning you were criticizing you would tell them what they weren't you were putting them in the place where they felt uncomfortable to talk to you you put pressures on them that you put on yourself and now you're like come talk to me let's have this close it's like the problem is you never sold the seed of time encouragement and communication but you want the bottom product of it because you're a parent the problem is Think You Are doesn't mean you can produce what it is you think you are you actually have to do something in order to see the end result so it means you read what you want Point number two I want to help you understand this one it's very easy and it seems that it's not something to understand as well but this happens all over so you read what you sow I'm gonna let you know those who so sparingly they read sparingly if your heart is a heart that is always considering the insufficient you will always operate out of the insufficient God tells you to give you say what will I have left God says I didn't ask about what you have left because I gave you what you have now but the problem is is that if you're not willing to sow bountifully how can you read bountifully real quick before I go to point number two and talk about it real quick this guy say this to y'all real quick want to let you know is that this is what God is saying you haven't sown anything into my house why would I sow something back into yours Pastor you try and get me to get them things called them tithes I know what you're doing you up here trying to get me to get no no no no no no no because see tithing is law giving is heart some of us have been doing law for a long time but it has never changed our heart some of us don't give it all so here's what we have to do we have to over ask for a seed for for a harvest that we never sowed God I want to be a millionaire you never sowed anything to put you into place to manage enough for you to be a millionaire I'm giving my tithe no no we aren't just giving a tithe we're giving out of our heart for scripture says God loves what kind of Giver just tell your neighbor you got to be cheerful it's not about how much when all your thinks of it it says you've got to be a cheerful Giver because God loves what amen Point number two you reap after you so somebody say after [Applause] this sounds pretty standard but if you heard what you're asking God for you would probably say it should make more sense God I need you to do and change my house God says great what did you do at my house oh I don't have time for your house oh okay but you you want me to do something for yours you read somebody say after you so so the question is what you're asking for have you sown it that's a you oh you should put that in your note real quick like just go ahead put that in your notes real quick did I sow this seed that I'm expecting to reap from did I saw it God I want you to I always pick on the single people I'm gonna pick on the married people single people y'all get it enough married people God you blessed me with somebody [Applause] but they are mean a snake question is have you sold into the marriage love and kindness to receive it back are you getting to see I'm I'm the nice one by whose definition the question is have you sown yet what you want to receive I need somebody to respect me are you so in respect the question is have you reaped what you're asking for can I get your story back in the day in church I love church because Church grew you up like the reason that you see a lot of musicians and things like that a musician is because that we all were a part of this whole thing of the idea of seed and the seed a part of it was is what that we were at a place where we would sit I don't anyway or y'all probably have we went to church and we would stay at church a long time people always talk about that it was long time I was in there for a long time and you still didn't get Jesus so um I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that that was in my head I didn't know it came out I have a mic anyway um yeah I never forget we would be on the side playing but we were looking at the drummers because I used to play drums and we would just stare y'all like oh my God we will wait for our time to get on and when I was growing up there'd be a children's choir Youth Choir Young Adult Choir [Music] the problem was everybody was on the same choir you just why is Sister Jenkins on the Children's Choir they didn't have a lot of kids this Sunday and they would give you an opportunity a chance right to play they'll be like you could play for the kids quiet man I would get up there and I would learn the music I would be so happy to play and you know at the end of it what I would ask for is another opportunity not a check because I wanted to sow into what I have my gifting my ability so that I could grow up saying that I have sewn into something to be able to reap a reward the question today is what are you asking for that you have not given a seed to but that you are expecting more from oh some of us are reaping now but we want more but the problem is is we haven't gotten better [Music] [Applause] you know James I'm looking for a raise what did you well what are you doing the same thing I was doing before here's the idea God doesn't say tenure is a part of him blessing you he says for those who are sowing the seed he says to the Sea I'll do what I'll multiply the seed the question is why are you in a field where you have not sewn a seed asking and begging for something that God already has for you scripture says this Genesis 8 and 22 he says this as long as the world exists there will be a time for planting and then a Time for Harvest somebody say planting and some might say Harvest he did not say Harvest and then plan it means you have to have faith enough to trust that God will give you the seed to sow so that you can see the return back from that seat it says there will always be cold and he Lord knows right now summer and winter I'm not sure if that's happening right now day and night today I want to tell you stop getting frustrated to God because you're in a seedless field Point number three that's my best one I love it I love it Point number three says this you read more than you so anybody know that to be true yeah anybody know that you reap more than you sow oh my goodness [Music] I mean you you I wish I could just sit down and talk to people about sewing and reaping like just a long you would be like oh really that's that's that's cool pastor but we don't understand we're seeing the product the literal product of what we are reaping but if we could so well we could reap bountifully I believe this today [Music] is that the way in which you're sowing you need to take a look at it again I haven't know you you dash in a little bit on the ground you know when you saw you when you sow you have to open the ground drop the seed so that this seed first when it grows takes root and then after the root comes the stem and then that stem provides the next phase if it's a tree leaves branches if it is fruit stems to give us something to eat from I want to let you know today it's going to take some time but I don't know if you've ever been there before when you plant a seed for an apple tree can I tell you one apple never comes from it that's root for an entire tree to produce multiple fruit because God is expecting that when he blesses you it's going to multiply somebody say multiply the Bible says be fruitful and what multiplied we was like oh Pastor that was only marriage [Music] that was the whole idea of what a seed is supposed to do somebody say multiply what is it that you need to sow that understanding in the right season and at the right Harvest it will reap more than you could ever imagine or think the scripture says this in Malachi chapter 3 verse 10 it says bring all the tithes the tenth into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house he says in tests me just tell your neighbor test them tell somebody else on the other side test them he says test me in this says the Lord of hosts if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you somebody say it's for me somebody got to declare tell somebody else say it's from me if I would I pour out for you so great a blessing until there is no more room to receive it I don't know if somebody has already caught that but I just believe right now that there is an overflow of blessing right now that God says if you would trust me with the seed that I have given you I will somebody say multiply it I'm believing that God is saying I will do more than you could ever imagine or singer I will pour out on you a blessing that you don't have room to be able to receive you gotta excuse me I need you to move over why my blessing takes up at least three to four seats I I just need you to move over just a hedge because I believe that my blessinger is going to spill out over now if you are in my company I just want to let you know something when it spills out for me it spills out for you God did not bless me for me God blessed me to be a blessing to you he told Abraham I will bless you I'll bless your seed I bless your seed Cedar and I will make you a blessing so that you can bless somebody else God give me a blessing I've got something for my brother God give me a blessing I've got something for my sister that is Overflow in the house somebody say Amen there's overflow in the house somebody say it's mad there's overflow in the house say it is for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] my mother's blessed my sister's blessed my wife has blessed my children are blessed my staff is blessed my church is blessed Mama everything connected to me is a blessed why because he opens up the windows of Heaven do you understand that That's No Boundaries so that means when God opens up the windows there is an overflow tell your neighbor there's an overflow [Applause] [Music] tell somebody around you stick with me it's gonna be overflowed just stick with me I I don't know what you got going on but just stick with me if you are lacking some Joy just stick with me I promise you right now you will overflow with that thing you I'm gonna make you laugh so hard you will cry I will put Tears In Your Eyes cause you will be on that floor and you will have joy unspeakable and full of Glory if you need some finances just connect with me because the way I'm sowing I'm so and so bountifully that's overflow everywhere I see it putting things despair buildings coming my way why it's overflow yeah [Applause] that's an overflow I don't care what I found that in the listen I don't I want to tell somebody today you might have failed in your past but I'm here today to let you know that scene that you are sowing there is a harvest for you to read today [Music] if we if we was real Church we'd be we I had that click track shouting and somebody would be on the side Just Praise it I mean just with a praise it cause you don't understand when God does overflow it is more than you children come out of overflow wounds are open and overflow change lives coming my family is blessing overflow my children are delivered ain't over hey overflow is much here's another [Music] [Applause] spiritual blessings the Bible says in high places it's overflow I don't care if you believe it or not I have a lot of faith and that text says I'll trust God my grandmother used to sing a song that says I'll trust them till I die [Music] you need to be in a season of God give me a seat I need a seed right now I need a seed and I need a field I need a seed and I need a feel I need a seed and I need a feel help me to

you're in this place and there's something that you're lacking [Music] but you've been asking God from a field that you haven't sown in [Music] right now I just want you to place one hand in the air whatever it is I just want you to see God give me a c for it whatever it is but there's joy that you lack whether it's confidence that you lack whether whatever whatever it is says God I need a seed for just give me a seed and if you give me a seed just show me where to plant it and the Bible says he'll multiply it and he'll feed you off of it and he'll give you more an abundance than you could
