[Music] thank you come on help me exalt the Lord in this place come on help me exalt the Lord in this place you just finished worshiping and singing can you help me exalt the Lord in this place come on o magnify the Lord with me will you help me exalt his name somebody say together come on help me exalt his name together come on let's do this together I need you you need me I need strength you need strength let's exalt him together let's create an atmosphere where I can feed off of your praise and you can feed off of my praise and together we can exalt the Lord together we shall enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise [Music] [Applause] we shall be thankful anybody thankful in the house anybody have a praise to say God I thank you you brought me through this week you brought me through today after anybody gotta I thank you on your lips right now can anybody yell out and hear Lord I thank you I just feel like if we're going to exalt some let's exalt them together I feel like if you came for strength today then sow the seed of strength and begin to praise him I feel like if you're in need of something then sow in what you need because God is saying I've got whatever somebody say right now [Music] my God [Music] so I just I feel this in this moment is that God is just calling for us at this place to move past what we feel to a place of where we can understand that because we're in a state in a moment of worship the Bible says we no longer worship Him according to our feelings but the Bible says we worship Him according to Spirit and the Bible says in truth and so what in truth that we know is that he is good regardless of where I am and what's happening in life right now and so what I can do is worship Him beyond the circumstance of what I feel to anybody right now move beyond the feeling of where you are and begin to exalt God right now and just say Lord I thank you now because of the way I feel but because of who you are I give you glory because of who you are I give you praise [Applause] it's because of who you are [Applause] [Music] I'm learning to worship you behoo because of who you are above what you will do I worship you for who you are and as we begin to really understand and exalt who God is in our life will always have a place of worship in the hearts that says it goes beyond what I feel it goes beyond where I am I can recognize that I was created to Worship You And so there's something on the inside that's always yearning to create an opportunity of worship so that I can give it over to God I just want to let you know what you're feeling on the inside is what you were purposed to do you were created to worship it's just the enemy that's really good at making us believe that we were called to occasionally and very casually give God what is due unto him but I want to let you know today is that through the very breath in your body and through the opportunity of that God has placed you here another day you were created tell your neighbor real quick you were created to worship I just want to give you a piece of your purpose today is that you were created to worship God today if nothing else you are created for your job you you are created for what the nine to five is you are created to be an entrepreneur you were created somebody say I created to worship [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so as you're operating your creation today your created purpose you will understand that operating in your purpose releases something that God wants to do on the inside of you that you cannot have done by a doctor a therapist by somebody that wants to sit next to you I'm telling you today there's something Supernatural that is release in your praise and in your worship to God today that will bring an overwhelming in your heart and in your spirit that you cannot understand the Bible says there is a peace that surpasses all understanding there is something that the Bible lets us know that all you've got to do is make your requests known and there is the peace of God that comes in the middle It's Supernatural it doesn't make any sense it's in the middle of the most broken moments in your life but there is a supernatural somebody say Supernatural there is a peace of God [Applause] that comes in the moment of worship where you see God I release it all to you today that you would fill my heart with a peace that even if it doesn't change I'll still worship you and even if it doesn't look different tomorrow I'll still give you the praise the glory and the honor that is due unto your name can we just give God a worship one more time in this place come on give God a worship one more time in this place [Music] as you're going down to you see just tell your neighbor real quick it's so good to see you come on I'm so glad I sat in this section with you I'm glad you didn't go to another section I'm glad you was with me from last week or the week before I'm just glad you sat in my section as I believe God wants to do something today I'm grateful I'm grateful that we have this opportunity to be in God's presence and I told our team today we will always make room for the presence of the Lord to be in this house we're in his house and so we flow according to what he's called for us to do welcome to the mix my name is Marcus England and I'm the lead Pastor here and I'm grateful that you are with us today [Music] [Applause] I really feel like I want to get into the word of God and so I'm excited two things are happening today growth track step number two discover Your Design is happening today so meet us after our experience we would love to be able to connect with you and we're also having baby dedications today so I love that as well I want to get into week two of our new series Heart to Heart somebody say Heart to Heart we're having a discussion heart to heart we believe it's an opportunity for God to speak to us in this moment so I want you to grab your notepads I want you to open up your iPad or your phone wherever you're taking notes I want you to grab your Bible because we're jumping into the word of God and I believe it's important that you're able to read and be a partner in this moment the Bible says we are not just hearers of the word but we are also now doers we are participants and allowing this war to unfold in our life and so we're going to be in Matthew the testimony of Matthew chapter 13. [Music] and Matthew one of the Disciples of Jesus we understand is an observer he is one who gives great detail such as loot to the testimony of Jesus life the testimony of his death his burial and his resurrection and in this manuscript Matthew is writing to let us know why he has given of himself his life his purpose over to this wall this way and he gives us an incense in Jesus life where Jesus has been operating and working all day to share the good news of who our God is and the Bible as it starts in in in in verse 13 this Collective of manuscripts it it lets us know that Jesus is in this place and he has to explain to his disciples so here's one of the things I want you to understand is that when you come into knowing who Jesus is it is okay to understand that you do not know everything there is to know about him I want to let you know it doesn't matter the amount of time that you have been a follower of Jesus Christ you will never know all of the Mysteries that are concerning Jesus but I'm grateful that he unfolds the understanding of the Kingdom the kingdom of God so that we can walk in newness of life in verse 10 of Matthew 13. it says this it says then the disciples came and said to him meaning Jesus why do you speak to them in Parables Parables of stories parables are examples that Jesus gives to bring clarity and it says and he he answered them to you it has been given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it has not been given to the one who has more more will be given and he will have an abundance [Music] but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away this is why I speak to them in Parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they under stand indeed in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive for this people's hearts have grown dull and with their ears they can barely hear and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with with what their heart and turn and I would heal them but bless are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for truly I say to you many prophets and righteous people long to see what you see and did not see it and to hear what you hear and did not hear it I want to talk from today's topic if I only knew if I only knew can we pray today Father in the name of Jesus we thank you for your word and I pray in this moment that our hearts would be open to receive your word help us to not just be hearers but doers of your word in Jesus name can somebody say amen amen thank you so much listen I I wanted to talk a heart to heart to you about the things that I wish oftentimes we only knew in this context of where I'm starting from I want to give you a picture that Jesus has been in purpose all day long the Bible lets us know that he has been teaching and ministering the gospel and it says when he goes to have a seat the Bible lets us know at the top of chapter 13 of Matthew that Jesus leaves the house and it says when Jesus leaves the house he goes out by the lake and for a minute he sits near where the shore of the lake is I don't know if you've ever been there before for some times after you just get off of a busy day or after your day has been swapped anybody just like to take a moment where you can just chill out anybody know about that you got your favorite show that you just sit down and watch it you got your favorite snack that you're going and you munch on if nobody has already eaten it you've got your leftovers that you hope are still in the refrigerator that you put your name on put tape on a gorilla glue down that no one else would take it because your your your your your food means that much to you anybody just ever been in a moment where you just need to take a break anybody ever been there and you find yourself at the place where you get in your favorite spot in your chair you take a moment and sit back and and you lay in the moment and and Jesus I believe in his human form is tired through the day because he's been ministering the Bible says he leaves out of the house and he goes by the Lakeshore he's he's up at Deep Creek y'all know what that looks like he he's on his Deep Creek View Jesus says I I got a view of the lake I wanna have a moment by myself but here is the promise that God oftentimes puts inside of us is that when you're operating in your purpose purpose never has a time frame I want to let you know today that when you're operating what God has called for you to do you don't set your hours God sets the hours for you and and and and and and and and and Jesus often said I am about my father's business whatever he says say I say whatever he says do I do and Jesus understood even in his tired moments of being a human he was submissive to the will of the Father the Bible lets us know what he gets by the lake there's something about Jesus and something about the work that he has been doing because when you operate in your purpose people tend to come around you people tend to Trend towards you because there's something special and unique about what's coming out of your life the Bible says that Jesus gets about the Lakeshore and it says a crowd begins to come around him and Jesus doesn't huff and puff you know he said Lord be done Jesus is by the Lakeshore and he sees the crowd crowding and because he understands purpose over preference he makes a decision that he's going to get him to the boat so that he can begin to continue to teach a lesson because he understands that in order to understand the kingdom of God the people must be taught here's the blind information that we get it's oftentimes that as we become a Christian we just tend to know what we're supposed to do the problem with just tending to know what you're supposed to do is that you will begin to make up your own rhyme and reason of why things are the way they are and you'll begin to do what you want to do because it feels good to the way you want to do it anybody ever been there before you don't have a rhyme and reason for why you do what you do you just did it my mama taught me that's what you do my daddy said that's the way that you do it and so because of what you've learned from your past it is a product of your present and can be the product of your future Jesus begins to speak and he begins to Proclaim and he begins to speak to the knowledge of what is to be and as I observe it Jesus sums it up and says you have been given insight into God's kingdom he tells the disciple I said Lord why do you keep talking in Parables you're you're talking about the person that sows it we sow on Rocky ground and we sow into thorns and we sow into these different areas and why do you keep talking to them about that and he says I have to make it simplistic I have to be able to share the story because they have not been open to the secrets of the Kingdom here's what I want to let you know the gospel oftentimes can become a hindrance to where you want to go because your spirit and your heart have not been opened up unto the secrets of the Kingdom there's something about being connected to the power of the holy spirit for the Bible lets us know that in order to know the mind of God you must be connected to the spirit of God the spirit word of God knows the mind of God and if the spirit of God knows the mind of God then I have to have the spirit to understand how to follow God you can't follow God thinking out of your good actions and your good ways it's not enough to be able to understand what God is saying for the Bible lets us know that his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts so when I think things are good God says it may be good but it's not purposeful so that's why I must be led by the spirit and not by The Good Will of my mind my thoughts or what I believe is right my intentions can be good my purpose could be off so I need to understand what is the will of the father which means I must be taught he tells the disciples you know how it works not everybody has this gift this insight to the things of God he says it hasn't been given to them whenever someone has already heard he says the insights and the understanding flow somebody say freely I want to connect you to this because God is not trying to keep him you it is the posture of your heart that allows God to know what's next and what's in line to be able to share with you through the power of the Holy Spirit what he has for your life you do not have to beg God for what's next he's ready to reveal it and share it but you've got to have the posture and heart of God somebody say Amen if I don't have God's heart then it does not freely flow because God is not willing to force himself into a place of understanding with you because you're not ready to receive here's why you can be a follower of Jesus Christ and yet evade the understanding of what God wants to do because God is not willing to rush through a wall that you have built to keep him out of I love God when I need him to do something but I keep God out when I'm trying to do my own thing anybody know about that I pray for God to take care of me to watch over me to keep my children but when it comes time to the things that I want that I'm not ready to be patient and wait for God to give to me I keep God on the outside so I can do my own thing on the inside and the Bible says your hearts have to be open enough free enough for God to flow in and speak to your very heart we learned last week the heart is not just the emotional state of where you live and where you're abiding but scripture tells us that the heart is about the whole entire person it is the thinking it is the feeling it is the rationing of where we are but I want to let you know today if there is a broken heart or a barrier to the things of God you will never find yourself in a place well you will understand what God is saying [Music] and to give Clarity to the very things that he's called you too I think about this oftentimes because I hear so much as I'm talking to people and and counseling people and in multiple conversations that I hear this statement said often if I only knew you ever said that before anybody ever been there before when you you knew somebody that betrayed you and and you got all close to them and you got all connected to them and you started trusting them and you wanted to say if I only knew if I knew you were going to betray me if I knew you were gonna act crazy if I knew you gonna be running your mouth on all my business if I knew you were trying to sneak in and take what God already declared over my life if I knew I would have kept you at Bay but here's what I want to let you know to today is that it is not by design that God is trying to keep you out it is that he wants for you to know the very purposes and plans that he has in store for you my question today is what does God get out of holding your purpose and your destiny back from you he gets no kick out of it it means that what it means that the creation that he has put into does not fully come into its full potential tell me what in the world would you put all your time and your effort creating before the creation of the world designing in such a unique way that you would get it all the way to this place and Reserve its understanding because you're a mean God I want to speak to you today because it's important that you know that God wants to share understanding with you but if your heart is not available then open I'm going to tell you today you can close off your next Clarity and understanding of what God wants to speak just at the reasoning that you don't understand what God is saying and I'll say to you today in order in order to understand what God is saying you've got to be connected to who God is connected to well I want to let you know today you need a networking opportunity everybody knows about networking opportunities we love to be in the room to network we love to talk to the people know the right folk know the right individuals that can move us to the next point the next destination we like to know the people who've got the the know-how we know we like the people who've got the the ability to say one word and all things are taken care of but here's what I want to let you know is that God will place the people in your direction but if you don't know who they who they are and don't have the clarity to be able to remove from your heart this thing that I'm introverted Jesus said I'm not introverted or extroverted let me tell you what I am I'm purposeful so purple says it doesn't matter if I feel like it and if I don't I move out of my purpose and not out of my preference [Music] we love labels because labels keep us from being responsible labels keep us in the place where I have something to blame for why I am what I am and for why I am where I am and I love a good label because if God is telling me to go and move and speak I can just tell god I'm an introvert uh Lord you know I don't do that you know that's not me you I don't talk to no never no not me can't be and we deny what God has created on the inside of us for the preference of who we think we are and who we think God has created us to be I want to know today what label have you placed in your life that gives you the excuse for moving beyond Where You Are because if you really knew who God created you to be you would be much more available regardless of the fear regardless of the pain regardless of the insecurities you would say if I only knew that's what God had destined for my life I would move beyond that conversation I would have talked to them earlier I would have moved into that interview and said what I would have said I would have been everything God you declared me to be but because I love the label because the label keeps me in my box and the box keeps me safe and the safety keeps me from having to deal with my fear and the fear helps me keep from going back to my past and I've created every wall and every barrier and every boundary to be able to keep me so I blame God for who I am and where I am but God says that has nothing to do with who I created you already to be you are a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do good works so if you had an idea that you could just say to yourself I am here to do the will of the father I am here to say what the father has said you would move out of any category of what people say you are and call you and you would just say I want to let you know today I am purposeful it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter what he tells me to do I am purposeful because when I'm purposeful I don't grab for things that bring me security I lean into my faith because I learned that faith without works is dead and because I don't want a dead faith it means I must lean into the uncomfortable to understand that only through the sacrifice of my presence can God move in my faith so that my Works will produce fruits or that I understand I'm walking in my purpose I love that that Clarity and understanding because when I walk in it I stop creating the barriers for what I won't do and what I will do the potential that God has said over your life is more than you could even understand it's greater than what you could ever think but what keeps you from your purpose and what keeps you from the next round of seeing exceeding abundantly above all that you can ask or think is your thoughts about you yeah [Applause] if I only knew what God had planned in store for me if I only knew or what I was called to do and how great I was called to do it I would probably move aside all these apprehensions and all these opinions and all the feelings of what I want to let people say today about who I am and I would start operating in a place that I've never been before and I would start searching out what parts of me have I not discovered yet because there's something on the inside of me that's a little bit greater than where I am why are you bored where you are why are you are where you are it's the reason it's because you have nowhere else to go because you have no other Vision to be able to obtain to that's why we go from job to job career to Career degree to degree because I need something to keep me moving and purpose but the problem is is you can get as many degrees as you want you can get in many jobs as you want and you can move up the ladder as far as far as you want but the problem is if you're not adhering to what God has said over your life you'll never impact and make the difference in the world all you'll do is get a bigger house bigger apartment bigger car not something nice and you will feel empty where you are and the problem with emptiness is that it cannot be filled by the things of this world so what will you look to you eventually have to go back to God and say Lord what did you create me for but the problem is is when I get too old I get too stuck foreign [Applause] God's calling you here no you can't be you can't be we got a house now it can't be I'm in the middle of the semester some of us have found ourselves in the place of fear because we don't know which direction to take so we take the road that we're good at instead of the road that requires faith so we live with dead faith yet active lives so the busyness of my life for me produces the results temporarily of what I need instead of Faith which may make me wait on the Lord while having the need to know what he's saying yet he tells me wait and be of good courage I can't be of good courage if I'm not actively doing and pursuing I can't be of good courage if I don't know what's next the Bible lets us know that's why you're finding all of your success through what you do and not who God says you are [Applause] so as you find your success through what you do and now who you are you grab on to whatever it is that you do so tight because your identity is in it and if you lose it you lose you [Music] but the problem with it is is it was never you [Applause] you haven't learned yet like I found myself at times in the place where you've stopped identifying yourself by what you're good at and what you get an Applause for would you be crazy enough to put yourself in a place where you stop getting applauses but yet was more impactful than you ever thought to be [Applause] see the Applause makes you feel like you're good where you are and the problem with feeling like you're good where you are is that you now begin like me to take the advice of people instead of direction of God you know you good you think so you think I'm good but you like you think I'm real you real gold I'm real good you're amazing I'm amazing and to wherever it fulfills us for the Applause we go to here's what I want to let you know is that the enemy places those in whom he knows are to be our destruction to actually clap for us see there's some people that are clapping for you not because they want to see your best interests happen but there are some people that are clapping for you because they know as long as they clap you'll stay right where you are I'll never forget this I was working at a job and I I was working with my wife and she said to me you know how you got to think about if you want to say I didn't plan this one so I was like holy spirit have your way we were at a job together and I'll never forget she said to me be careful because the tactic around here is that to get you in is to buy you gifts and purchase things so that it appeases you enough that you think somebody is for you because they're gifting you and the enemy has no problem gifting you with the things that you don't have as long as you stay from doing the things that God called you to do see every blessing that you have I want to let you know it's not the blessing you think you were supposed to receive the Bible says every good and perfect gift comes from above and when it comes from above it leaves a peace on the inside of you that you don't have to worry about compromising your morals compromising your character compromising your integrity to get here's why I want to step on your foot just a little bit God is not bringing things into your life that go against his will I don't care how good it is but Pastor you know I mean God put this in my life no no no maybe God put it in your life and you are using it the wrong way I can use a car to drive well I can use a car to kill somebody it's all about understanding its purpose what it's there to do what it's there for if I don't know then I use it according to what I need it to be used for when I understand his purpose I understand I'm using it for what he called me to use it for every time let me share this with you real quick every time my wife and I we look at uh we talk about houses we talk about where we're going to live we talk about what we're going to do we always talk about it from the perspective of how many people can we fit that's what we do how many people can we get in here babe I don't know we start creating decor according to the amount of people that we want to be able to see according to the amount of people that we want to be able to people sit on the steps then I think like we could do one two three we we start counting because we understand that everything God has given us is for his purpose and his plan it's not just for my enjoyment because I've seen something in the world and now I'm trying to bring it close to me because everything about my life is now about me if I only knew that everything God has given me he's called me to story somebody say Stewart better word let me give you a word that's not so Bible he's called for us to manage I want to let you know today that everything God gives you you're nothing but a manager that's all you are when you walk in it Lord how you want me to manage this today with the hall how you want me to manage this today when God gives you finances that you get on every Friday or Tuesday or first and 15th I don't know when you get it but it's all about how do you want me to manage it there are three problems that I believe exist amongst our society that we use as a common point of why we don't move forward and what God's called for us to do one of the first problems I believe is that we say this I didn't know and I didn't know allows us oftentimes to live out the role of a victim because I didn't know I didn't do so you can't blame me for what I didn't know the next part that we live out is I ignored what I knew anybody ever been there before I know you have you saw the signs you saw the red flags didn't sound right you looked at it you said this ain't it but because you committed yourself you ignored the leading of the Holy Spirit and you chose your preference over his purpose scripture says I do what he says do I say what he says say and oftentimes I find people that's ignored what they knew are now living a life of regret you hear anybody talk about that man if I had never if I only never I knew and then they want to talk to you about all the 15 things they saw that you told [Applause] you be like pastor we gotta live in Grace and Truth well I'm on truth we'll get to Grace I told you we saw it we saw it at Thanksgiving we knew it was I told you you did it anyway then we have the people that I'm not willing to learn what I don't know because they live in prideful hearts here's what I think one of the first things I think we have to do is understand and take responsibility for what you don't know I don't know anybody know when you have your first child you didn't know what she was doing [Music] you knew it but you act like it I remember when our daughter Maya she she had our grandson my wife said she's going to come over and live I said excuse me she said she's going to come over and live because for the first month she needs to know what to do and I want to make sure that I can teach her and tell her what to do I say you can't do this through like a zoom call or something like is there another way that we can figure this out is it is that some kind of way we could teach this lesson without being so up close and she said because if I don't teach then how will she know some of you you could say today if if someone had shown me I would have never walked down that road if somebody just had informed me I would have I would have left it alone if somebody would have just given me the heads up I'll let it go it's somebody that told you you should have left that friendship alone I'm trying to tell you they ain't going nowhere I don't know why you keep it you just said I would and I keep trying to call you this friend but you keep betraying me [Music] if I only knew I think we have to understand and take responsibility of what we don't know my question today is what are you willing to admit that you don't know or are you saying you know everything so you have nothing to admit there's a place that you've got to get in your life well you got to say I'm smart but I don't know it all anybody have been there before I got 14 years of marriage I still tell you I'm smart but I don't know it all I still have to learn we still have to have mindset that want to grow the question is do you want to grow because if you don't want to grow you'll make excuses as a victim for where you're not where you want to be and you'll keep making the excuses until you take responsibility tell your neighbor real quick I got to take responsibility tell somebody else on the other side I got to take responsibility see third choice I'm sorry I'm a third choice but I gotta take responsibility because we love tell ing us what they got to do but you got to take responsibility for you you you listen you you working yourself to death don't blame that on nobody else don't blame BG and E you want it to get the house with 19 lights in it you should have got the house where you had candles all over yo BG e Bill High because you keep turning the lights on don't blame your children yeah you gotta take somebody say responsibility It's ability for what I have no ability to be able to put myself into it but for the things that I have responsibility over it is me in need of prayer oh Lord help me [Applause] can we be a people that stops saying I'm the victim and we start saying actually I'm the Victor I moved from a victim mentality to a Victor mentality which says it doesn't rest in my emotions it goes beyond and I'm going to do I want to say this word very loudly whatever to move from where I am whatever somebody say whatever you need to write that down capitalize and put circles around it put highlights around it take a picture of it put it as your screensaver I will do whatever it takes to get out of the broken place of thinking that I'm not enough taking this idea that I'm the victim and saying for whatever I did not know I cannot change from my past but what I know in my present and what I do with present information and going to the future I will use to make an impact in the rest of my life Proverbs 1 and 7 says this it says the Reverend fear of the Lord that is worshiping him and regarding him as truly awesome is the beginning and the preeminent part of knowledge its starting point and its essence it says this it's not talking to you but it's talking probably to your neighbor this is not you it's your neighbor but don't look at your neighbor because that's rude look at you neighbor just read it up there and say Lord if you see them close their eyes they're praying for you Lord this is about them right now I just pray that you help them it says this but arrogant fools despise skillful and godly them an instruction and self-discipline we're gonna keep that right there no let's let's make sure that let's get that back up we gotta keep that up take your picture of it get it record it don't get another translation this is the one I want you to have that one the question is are you an arrogant fool thinking that you know everything that you're above God I'm the one that knows you know what I don't have to listen to the Bible says and that's why in Matthew Chapter 13 He says I've got to talk in parables because they don't understand the secrets of the Kingdom he said so I have to describe it in such a way that they had the ability to through the level level in which they can because their hearts are not open it is not a knowledge issue because if it was a knowledge issue that means there would be a disparity in all those in who could come to understand God's Will and purpose over their life but what he says is it is not a mind it is not a knowledge issue it is a heart issue The Arrogant fools despise I I don't need them to say nothing to me I know I love people that talk me and talk talk to talk to me yeah I just want to make sure you know me I'm always considering I love people that talk to me to death about what they do [Music] but they don't talk me to death about what they don't do you ever had someone running you their resume but it's a resume about all the good stuff you know you know how they do how you been this week I've been good I've been amazing yeah yeah okay you know why because I don't sweat small stuff you're like okay you know why because I'm in control of me and they just keep going on and on and on and it's like well what do you need Improvement in look at me nothing I'm good I'm good I'm fit you see this you see where I'm at see how great I am That's How Great Is Our God and there's how great am I two songs I sing every morning thank you because the Bible says we think so highly of ourselves it's time for us to understand and take responsibility for what we don't know the third second thing I really want us to get is that we must learn to be content not complacent we've got to learn to be content meaning it may not be moving the way I want to right now but I know the setup I know how anybody know how God works in the last moment when you don't have nothing left that the Bible says in your most empty state in the place where you can't get together you don't have the motivation you don't have the willpower he said at your weakest moment his strength is made perfect can you learn to be content Where You Are just know that you're not going to stay there sometimes you need to just somebody say this word wait that's a hard word it's like a curse word because everything in life tells us instant is the way that we live an instant gratification an instant move we have doordash [Music] I don't know if you've ever been there before but you've doordashed something that's like a block away from you [Applause] I know you have that's I've done it are you gonna walk over oh no oh no I'm just gonna bring it over here but it's right there I prefer being at a complacent place of comfort then challenging my life to grow in a space where I need to be content I mean I don't look toward the future tint means while I'm looking to the Future I'm staying put I'm not complaining I'm not talking about where it isn't where it hasn't gone how I don't have it why I can't be I'm not moving in there I wish I had I wish you did and God starts to say if I give it to you I know you don't even have the strength to hold on to it so I'm making you wait right until I find that you're ready to be able to take in what I'm giving you some of us like being ahead of God and we're like God actually you're taking too long and God's like I'm not taking too long you're just not developing yet too [Music] seeing the picture differently if I only knew that being content with my singleness with my job with where I am with my location if I stop chasing comfort and my preference I could hear God's will when I sit still anybody ever had to tell yourself sit down you ever been there before sit down what are you up for again you know because I gotta I gotta make sure I go you know we gotta we gotta make sure we what are you making sure I don't know I don't even know because busyness has become the consumption of my life and I don't know what patience and waiting on God looks like so I always move ahead of God before I'm ready yet I need God to step in where I should have understanding Philippians 4 let's turn to it verse 11. through 13 says this not that I am speaking this is Paul speaking to the church in Philippi this is not that I am speaking of being in need for I had learned in whatever situation I am to be somebody said content I know how to be brought low [Music] and I know how to abound in any and every and any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger abundance and me this is why when you know this you stop becoming so fearful and so threatened he says I can do all things through who let's say it together I can do all things through who I can do all things through Christ I can budget through Christ I ain't getting no events on that one thing you can build your financial wealth through Christ you don't have to work yourself into a upheaval compromise who you are and where you are to get to where you want to be you can do all things through Christ [Applause] I can do all things through Christ that at every level of where I get weak the by the Bible says he'll what strengthen me tell your neighbor real quick he'll strengthen you tell somebody else he'll strengthen you he'll strengthen you so stop thinking your reserves and your multiple excess is what is the security of what you need the Bible says he'll take you through every moment of weakness and he'll strengthen you I can be content right now I remember when my wife and I we married we were together and I'll never forget and we were going through them beginning struggles of marriages we were struggling y'all my wife had quit her job she started the daycare business with two kids when you start a daycare business with two kids that are friends the payment schedule I won't get into that right now God has healed me but [Music] I'll never forget I came out of a home my mother she she she cooked everything you know we do this organic we don't we don't really do the processed foods and I say yes ma' I know that's right because we we maintain healthy bodies in Jesus name and she said yes we don't we don't get into all of that and we we we we we we we boil it and we and we clean it and and we make sure it comes from the right farming even today I'll ask my mom what kind of salmon should I pick up what what's not to get and she'll lead and guide me but in those days in that season let me tell you something I learned about Mary stakems my God my God my God and I had to say I can do all things through Christ that's right that strengthens me the problem is you have been so stuck oftentimes in a season of the thing that you only know that you have no adaptability to the things that God is trying to do and the agility in your life is all about what you have been lying focused in on that only you can see only you want and only you want to do and God says you need to change up in this season this may be a Ramen season foreign that is the proper term Ramen we don't use oodles and noodles anymore we have moved up in life but whether it's sacrums Ramen oh you got to do a captain Captain James or like a Captain Franks you got the ball some hot dogs you got to figure out whatever season because you know Lord I can't afford this if I go out and buy organic chicken that's 72 dollars for every six and I can't do it right now so you better keep this body will turn me into a vegetarian here's what I'm saying when you don't have flexibility and the faith to believe God can work and do and you think it's your responsibility to take it in your hands you miss everything that God has set and planned for your life because you've already boxed God in to what your plan is and not his plan if I only knew sometimes as a pastor I'd be like I don't want to hear you afterwards I don't want to hear that Pastor let me talk to you no I want to talk to you because I told you before somebody said Point number three prepare for a different outcome some of us are still looking at the same outcome that we had before and we've done nothing in our lives to change the direction and where we're going always saying is if I can just survive and the Bible says Paul wrote we we're more than conquerors [Music] not we're conquerors we're more we're greater we don't just get by we don't just get over we Triumph we're Victors we have extra we had Surplus we had spilling over huh if you look at scripture lets us know and he's willing to bless us in a way that is pressed down [Music] shaken together and running over [Music] we'll settle for just enough but today God has called you to prepare for a different outcome in your life Wherever You Are the relationship the marriage financially he was saying God I've been stuck in this financial rut forever God says won't you prepare for a different outcome won't you try a different direction won't you try trusting me instead of trusting you [Music] I'll never forget just a moment in time where I started activating that dead faith I start saying God I'm I'ma trust you I don't have a lot to trust you with I'm trust you God says I wasn't interested in your resource I was interested in your heart I was interested in what you trust me that I called you to be a manager not to be tight encrypt with the things of this world in this life Romans 12 is our last scripture verse 2 says this doesn't do not be conformed to this world any longer with its superficial values and Customs but B somebody say transform and progressively changed don't do the same thing you did last time don't walk the same way you walked last time can I there's a word from the Lord I'ma tell somebody today stop being so pressed creating meaning the enemy sees how weak you are because of how precious you are [Music] that's how you're willing to sacrifice the purpose potential and what placed over your life just so you can get a little moment of Happiness of what you think is going to be the total change in your life I want to let you know today stop being pressed of what the enemy can send you he can send you anything that looks good in the package but its value is worthless [Music] [Applause] this progressively changes you mature spiritually by the renewing of your mind focusing only on Godly values Godly values not flesh not broken mindsets not desperate ways Godly values and ethical attitudes so that you may prove God has nothing to prove to you so that you may prove for yourselves what the will of God is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan and purpose for you today I believe this moment that God has a plan intentionally for you but you can no longer use the excuse if I only knew today he's telling you there's more John Pennington says this for the thief the enemy comes to steal to kill and to destroy but Jesus said I come that they might have life and have life to the full anybody want a full life today anybody want an abundant in today I want to pray for you in this moment the abundance is not about what you have the abundance about who God has called you to be
