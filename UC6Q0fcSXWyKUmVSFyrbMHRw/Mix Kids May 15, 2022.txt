and exciting ways to know god so that you can tell others about god's love i am so happy to be here with you guys this week last week was mother's day and we talked about how moms have to obey god our bible story today is about a prophet named micah he is considered one of the minor prophets but his message from god is very big the people of israel had been rebellious and god's wrath his anger was coming soon in the chapters before our story micah explained to the people what is about to happen as we begin reading today we will discover that micah already knows what their responses will be so he tells them what it is and why is it important to god as we look at our story pretend you are in a crowd and micah is talking to you how would you feel take a look over there is holy she is really old and wise and tells us wonderful stories from the bible ah tubby i was having the most wonderful nap hello holy we are so happy to see you awake now that you are up you have to tell us a story from the bible please all right all right calm down i will tell you all a wonderful story but you have to answer a question at the end of it if you do i have a surprise for you that is great holy we will listen very carefully we promise great then i will start today's story it is about mika long time ago there lived a man named mika mika was a very loving man who lived in a small town in judah he loved god dearly and could not tolerate it when god's commandments were not being followed by his people the people of the town where he lived was slowly moving away from god they were becoming very greedy telling lies and tricking other people in those times each family had land to grow crops but when the crops did not grow properly they would have to borrow money from other people to buy seeds to grow and also to buy food to eat these people would ask for a lot of money in return and if this money was not paid back then their lands were taken away and their families were sold as slaves even the priests were of no help they twisted god's laws as and when they wanted to and tricked the poor people mika was sad to see that the rich were getting richer and the poor people were getting poorer he warned everyone god does not like your ways you will be punished but their people did not care they thought god would protect them mikhail then said god will leave the temple jerusalem will be gone there will be a forest in its place but in the future god's messenger will come from bethlehem to save israel what was the name of the loving man who loved god dearly i can answer this holy the loving man was named freckles dear that is right and the surprise is that i will sing along with you this time god requires us to show godly behaviors such as fairness mercy and humility there here are a few examples of how to show godly behaviors to others showing fairness is when your teacher runs out of airheads and the last student didn't get any and you have a large pile so you share some of yours with them showing mercy is when your classmate forgets his or her lunch money and you share your lunch with them so that they can have something to eat also showing humility is when you want to join in with other kids boasting at how well you play but the better action would be to praise god and thank the other teammates for a game well plea from the great prophet micah we learn how god wants us to live we learn three things that pleases god more than any sacrifice he wants us to act justly and fair show mercy and walk humbly before him when we do these things we not only live godly lives we become more effective at sharing jesus with others we will plant seeds to carry out the great commission because others will want to discover why we practice justice show mercy and live humbly someone may ask why are you being so kind to me someone else may comment she is always so humble i wonder how she can always be like that still another may say he always treats others fairly not like other kids when others see these qualities in your life they want to know what why are you like this and they understand that you are living for god so you have to open your heart to make positive change so that they can make positive change in their lives and then they will ask you what it why are you so positive it's because i live for jesus our memory verse for this week says blessed rather are those
