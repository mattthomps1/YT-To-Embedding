my name is Marcus England and I'm the lead pastor at the mix and I am grateful and excited about what God is doing here in the local church we are on week two of our series keeping score and last week

called to make a difference in an impact we want you to bring your sacrificial offering and we want you to pray and ask God lord what can I and what not can I but should I do and we want you to come with that commitment in your heart even if you don't have it all now I want you to be able to by faith believe that God can do more than we can imagine or think all right so now we're getting in to the message I want you to get out your notepads I want you to get out your Bible spread it across open up tell everybody shh we gotta get into the word of God week two of keeping score I want to let you know this is that God wants to move in your life today and one of the examples of scripture that I really believe is impactful and has always been impactful for me is in Luke chapter 23 it represents the opportunity the moment as Jesus is going to Calvary and the Bible lets us know in one of the most painful and hard moments of his purpose and living it out Jesus does something that defies truly what we would call forgiveness and honestly he magnifies what he came for for that is to love each and every person we get scripture John tells us in John 3 16 that God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever will believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life but there's one thing to say it and write it there's another thing to live it and as we jump into the scripture we're in Luke chapter 23 and we have the testimony of Luke that he is giving as in a recount as he's done research about what happened on the day that Jesus went to the cross he gives us an account that helps us to understand what Jesus went through and when we started verse 20 verse 33 it says this and when they came to the place that is called the skull it says There They Crucified him and the criminals one on his right and one on his left and Jesus said father forgive them I gotta let you know what's happened Jesus has been arrested he has been tried unfairly he's been deserted by all of his friends he's been denied by one of the closest people in a circle he has been beaten he has been whooped he has been hit he has been cursed at and he has been sentenced to death unfairly Jesus now with a cross on his back and a crown of thorns on his head bleeding hurting he walks to a place called the skull which is known as Golgotha and on this hill Jesus's to be crucified as they set him up to be crucified and they hang this cross the Bible says that the words that come out of his mouth is not how could you it's not I hate this is not this is the worst thing ever but what he says in the middle of his pain his father forgive them for they know not what they do it says and they cast lots to divide his garments and the people stood by watching but the rulers scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the Christ of God this Chosen One the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine and saying if you are the king of the Jews save yourself not did only his people speak against him and mock him but those who did not even know him scoffed and mocked him and it says there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the Jews one of the criminals who were hanged railed at him saying are you not the Christ save yourself and us but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear God since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly for we are receiving the due reward of our Deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he said Jesus Remember me when you come into your kingdom and he said to him truly I say to you today you will be with me in Paradise oh my that is a scripture right there that is a testimony of who our God is I want to come from this topic today that we can connect with want to come from this statement remember no more remember no more can we pray father in the name of Jesus we ask that you would move in this moment there's so many of us that are heard and broken and all we do is relive the pain but I'm praying through your word that you will help for us to understand how we remember no more for we love you we honor we thank you in Jesus name we say Amen hey I think this is quite an opportunity and quite a moment for us to to share to talk because right from the title I know somebody said pastor I can forgive but I cannot forget I can forgive but I can't forget you don't know what's happened you don't know what's taking place in my life you don't know what people have done to me you don't know the bullying that I've endured you don't know the people that have spoken against me you don't know the attacks that I've had in my life so I understand you when you say forgive I can comprehend that but to remember no more I can't do that I want to say to some of us I understand I understand where you are I understand to to the individual that has hurt you into the individual that has put you in a very insecure place in your life to the individual that mocked you for years and years and years of the person that hurt you for years and years and years that you can't forget it's a part of who you are it's a part of your life it's a part of the things that have happened but here's what I want to place inside of you there's something about the way you remember [Music] not just the idea behind it it's the way you will remember can can I can I share with you that there have been many stories in my marriage that as a husband I have a Clarity on there are arguments that have come up yes arguments moments discussions you want to say because I'm Christian I should call them there have been disagreements that sounds better for you it sounds pastoral for you they were arguments I did not agree and my wife did not agree and anybody know when you are in the middle of a heated moment anybody can be honest with it and say you will recount the story according to your Viewpoint your POV your point of view you will give a recount of the way things are and the way things have happened I want to be honest there is something about me that I will say something and I will have a moment with my wife as I am properly defending my thought or View and when I go back to rehash what I said anybody know you you make it better than what you said before anybody listen I know I'm not the only person you you make the anybody ever recounted a story a moment and all of a sudden new points of views are added to it you haven't you ever seen yourself there before you even added people you've changed your tone the way you said it wasn't as sarcastically as you said it before you don't remember calling them that name you don't remember saying it that way and so you remember it in a new way anybody ever been there before or anybody have been on the opposite end where where you make it more drastic than it was anybody ever embellish I won't call you a liar I'll just say embellished a little bit more you ever been there before I found myself there we've been in the middle of an argument I'm walking through it I'm talking to her and then I make my point on the second go around seem really good and I said you have no right to feel that way because the way and the tone that I am talking to you is as a man of God she looks at me with this side view as if to say I don't think you remember who you were two minutes ago when you said it I've recounted myself I've gotten myself together and I've presented it in a better light I'm talking this way and and I'm having this moment with you because a lot of times we find ourselves at a place that when we remember the hurt that we've gone through we can tend to remember it worse and worse and worse can I tell you some of us have found ourselves in some of the most broken and abusive places and while we have forgiven it is the remembering that keeps us at a standstill oh if I could just talk about that real quick if I could talk about the moment where your standstill is keeping you where you are if I could talk about the moment where you are finding yourself in position where where you have forgiven at least that's what you believe in your heart but the place that you find yourself in your forgiveness is that you remember it with anger so you say you forgive but the question is have you really forgiven because every time we bring it up there's a new addition to the story you ever been there before amen what happened let me tell you what happened you start going into it and then he hit me twice wait first of all I don't remember anybody hitting you when did when did that happen you have people that start to question the elements to the story and the reason why we add on to a story is because oftentimes we're still hurting and we're still in a space where we haven't forgiven there's something about when you've made a decision to let go that there's a freedom that you walk in that you're not paralyzed by The Moments of what used to be but you're free in the moments of who you are today I want to speak to you because I think about this moment of what Jesus was going through I I want to share that all of this that took place happened in a very short span of time it wasn't if Jesus that went through something that took two and three weeks to walk through no this was an overnight moment what happened Jesus was arrested from his arrest he literally was taken to the high priest's home from there he was accused in the morning he was taken over to be convicted and in his conviction he was sentenced to death and in his death he was full of betrayal that happened to him he was full of lying that was spoken against him all for the purpose so that in his death we could have life I think it's important because it seems like Jesus had a loss of memory I don't know if you can understand that but the Bible says as they were crucifying him they were crucifying him not even by himself but between two criminals two actual people who were convicted of doing wrong the Bible says as he's being crucified they are being crucified and in the midst of him being crucified the Bible says that Jesus speaks and in his words he says these things father forgive them man only the Son of God could only in this moment could you find a space literally yourself from all of the pain that you have just endured to the pain that you're enduring now of dying that you could come into a clarity to ask your father to forgive them I think you may be missing this moment right here because I don't think you fully understand and get the clarity that to separate your pain from your purpose it is something that only God can do within us if Jesus has stayed at a place where he allowed what he felt to be the determining point of how he lived out his purpose he would have never born the weight of the cross he would have done exactly what was said if you can save others save your self I think that's crazy because I think in the moment oftentimes most of us when we have been hurt and broken our first response to life is what save yourself when when hurt happens when Brokenness takes place when you find yourself in the middle of a space where there is nobody that is around you that seems like they care and you seem to be by yourself I mean here today to let you know the devil is oftentimes whispering in your ears save yourself but in order to fulfill your purpose that God has established over your life I need you to understand you cannot be focused on you you have to be focused on the purpose of what God is speaking over your life the enemy says save yourself the Bible says forgive your enemies oh my goodness everything seems controversial because there's no way that in the midst of being hurt and in the midst of Brokenness and in the midst of someone physically hurting me or mentally hurting me or abusing me or leaving me or throwing me to the side are you expecting me to forgive them but I'm saying today is that God is calling you to remember this thing differently he's causing you to remember this thing in such a way that I want to let you know today that it's not about what they just did to you it's about that he is a God that said that I will not let you die I will keep you even in the midst of your most broken storms I want to tell somebody today if I could just preach this moment to you is that while you are hurt you are a what conqueror you are not just a Survivor but you are victorious in the name of Jesus Christ you're looking and remembering this only for the hurt that it brings but I want to let you know today you've got to remember this for the victory that God has over your life you did not fall you did not fail you did not break apart you were not crushed but she made it that's a moment right there to just lift your hands and thank God you made it you got to tell somebody around you I made it I understand how the enemy tried to destroy me I understand that the beginning of my life looked like a wreck and it was a mess but I'm here today to let somebody know that I made it I made it in the midst of the hurt I made it in the midst of the storm I made it in the midst of the Brokenness baby if you looked at me and understood what I went through what I look like now if you heard the Hebrews boys I don't smell like the fire that I've been in but I want to share with you today is that God has brought you through Victorious so I want you to remember this thing differently as the god of Healing Begins to bring freedom don't stay right where you are you've got to say to yourself I am a Victorious living breathing individual who is walking out the plan that God has I need you to remember this thing differently I would need you to remember this thing in such a way that you stop being a victim and start being a Victor I need you to remember this thing in such a way that you said that God has kept me I need you to remember this thing in the way that said it did not destroy my purpose it did not in my destiny I have still everything that God has in store for me I need somebody to praise him right now because in the middle of all your trials and troubles God has still kept you you got to remember this thing differently I'm stopped remembering this thing that's only the hurt that it's brought me but I have to remember that the Bible says that he works all things out for my good that even in the middle of my Brokenness and my hurt and my pain God is working this thing out for my good I don't know if you're in your living room right now I don't know if you're at work I don't know if you're behind the nurses that's what there needs to be a praise right now because he's working this thing out for your good he doesn't want this to be a block that stains you forever he wants this to be a thing that you can break out of I know who I used to be but it's not who I am today I know what they did to me but it does not identify who I am I'm speaking to somebody today in your forgiveness is a new identity in your forgiveness is an opportunity to understand I am the Victor not a victim just tell your neighbor real quick I am a Victor not a victim it's the way I remember it it's the way that God is has established me it's the way that God has placed this in my mind it's a way that I understand and I'm no longer blaming people and I'm no longer blaming God for where I am I'm understanding if this is the hand that I've been dealt then I'm going to trust God in every moment of what I do because I truly believe he is God and God Alone I want to say to you today I believe in this moment that God has something in store for you and I want you to have this opportunity and moment to know that the way you remember it is impacting the way you see yourself and the way you see your life I've got to change the way that I'm thinking I'm I've got to change the way that I see this I've got to change the way that things are happening because if I don't change it I'll reproduce what's already inside of me Brokenness will produce Brokenness let's get to that first point point number one don't let her reproduce itself don't let her reproduce itself you've heard it said that her people hurt people well I want to let you know today is that in this moment an opportunity if you don't get with Clarity if you don't get with understanding that if you stay where you are you will produce the seed and bear the fruit of the seed that's inside of you Pastor well you don't understand what I've been through Pastor you don't understand what I'm going through you don't understand what they did to me I may not understand it but here's what I know if you don't want to reproduce something that's broken it's going to require for you to see something different I've got to get healing so that I can reproduce a healed person I can reproduce a healed Community I can reproduce What A healed household some of us can't produce anything but what's inside of us and so I'm going to say to you today you've got to stop reproducing hurt you've got to stop reproducing pain and you've got to start Allowing God to do something new I'm believing it today somebody just say right on this chat I am believing God to do something new on the inside of me I will not reproduce Brokenness I will not reproduce addiction I will not reproduce inside of me a sense of failure I will not reproduce inside of me a victim mentality I will not reproduce inside of me a depression and an anxiety and loneliness that I can't get Beyond where I am I'm here to declare to somebody today is that you shall not reproduce Brokenness you shall bear good fruit the Bible lets us know we're called to what bear that good fruit that fruit that's going to change the way we see the world that fruit that's going to change the way that we love I'm telling you today you're asking God to sing you the right one but all that you can reproduce into a spouse is the Brokenness that you already have some of you got to get healed before God can bless you with something new because all you'll do is go and hurt somebody else just tell your neighbor real quick I got to get out of this I got to get off of this I've got to get healed so I can bear good fruit I need you God to produce good seed so that I can pair good fruit God I need this fruit I need what's inside of me to be reproduced For Your Glory the Bible lets us know in Luke chapter 6 verse 45 it says a good person produces good out of the good stored up in his heart an evil person produces evil out of the evil sword up in his heart for his mouth speaks from the Overflow of the heart oh can can I can I can I pull you back to this moment real quick those of you that are women listen I want to let you know those of you that are with us this context is crazy Jesus only produce what was inside of him forgiveness came out of him because it was inside of him he produced what was already inside good produces good you can try to act good but at the end of the day the fruit that comes out of you is the fruit of good when it's what in your heart I'm telling you today is that if you have hurt in your heart you will reproduce hurt if you have loneliness in your heart you will reproduce loneliness if you have abandonment in your heart you will reproduce abandonment you have to bear good fruit we've got to go back to the place and say father I need you to give me good seed on the inside of me to reproduce that which is good Jesus said even on this cross as they mock me as they talk about me as they lie on me he said what I will reproduce what what my father is I don't know if you understand that some folk can say some stuff to you but when you know who your father is when you understand where you came from when you got your identity in check it don't matter if they laugh at you it don't matter if they talk about you it don't matter if they make insults at you you've got to say I know who I am I know what's inside of me I know what my father has done for me Jesus said I only speak what my father tells me to speak I only do what my father tells me to do I'm here today to let you know if you're speaking broken things you've got a broken mentality but if you can stand up against the enemy and let the enemy know it doesn't matter hell or high water I will yet praise the name of the Lord why because praise is inside of me praise is what I do praises who I am oh God if we could understand it we will say what's inside of me is being produced on the outside of me the reason why I'm so optimistic and I have hope is because I understand this hope inside of me the Bible lets us know that he who had begun a good work what shall perform it there are things there are seeds there are scriptures inside of me that I understand I understand that he that is inside of me is making a Way Beyond what I could imagine or even think he's doing exceeding and abundantly above all that we can ask or think it's on the inside just tell somebody I'm so happy and I'm so glad because why it's on the inside of me why I got favor why because it's on the inside of me I think what's favor I talk with favor I operate with favor I'm moving the faith that God has for me I'm excited why do you come every day so excited because something on the inside of me says that God has more in store for me and I believe it today I'm excited y'all because I just believe this is an opportunity for us to see the power and the movement of what God wants to do inside of our Lives even in the midst of Trials the Bible says I'll be able to stand I'll be able to stand firm in the foundation and the things of God I'll be able to stand sure and understand that God is moving and he is moving and directing me into the way he's called for me to be I'm saying it to you today I need you to understand this thing there is something about understanding that I don't have the opportunity to reproduce Brokenness I'm called to reproduce healing that comes through Jesus Christ Point number two I want to let you know this I want to I want you to tell us to your haters not your neighbors but your haters and I want you to tell the mocking is used to discourage some of you we anybody like me sometimes you're you you've got a little fuse some people have long my my fuse is really really short can get quick y'all anybody I'm just trying to be honest with you I know I know I know I'm walking with Jesus but oftentimes the mocking the harsh comments the People speaking against can I can I get deeper the individual honking at you at the red light the person that that disregards you or makes you seem like you're not important can I can I can I talk to the people that people look down upon them people look at as if they're unworthy or unfit can I tell you when when you're mocked it is a strategy of the enemy to discourage you have to start getting that in your mind and start getting Clarity behind what you understand the information that I'm trying to give you is a moment an opportunity for you to stop operating out of your feelings and then exercising a reaction to everything that happens and to be proactive to understand that not only that I understand that mocking it's all about discouragement mocking it's all about getting me off focus now that I recognize what the enemy's trying to do I won't react the same way I used to react the scripture says in Jude chapter 1 verse 18 it says who told you that in the last times there should be come mockers walking according to their own desires in ungodliness what does a mocker do a mocker is an individual who finds himself at the place where they come after an individual to get them distracted to get them off focus to get them away from the purpose mockers are individuals to get you off your cross I'm here today to let you know there's something about what a mocking person does there's something about why people are talking about you they're trying to make you lose your focus but you got to let them know today I've got blinders on I can't see to the left or to the right I won't be discouraged I won't be removed I won't Flint I won't faint I will be what sound in the favor and the will of God I made a decision that I'm going to focus into what God has called for me to do I understand you're trying to distract me see the issue is people are telling you you got to get rid of your haters but some of you don't even know who your haters are because they look like friends and your haters look like friends because they're speaking sarcastically to what is happening in your life as to make you doubt what God has already spoken and here's what I want to let you know is that when you are distracted by people when people have your mind when people have your heart then they start to manipulate you and they start to do things and say like they said to Jesus since you saved others won't you save yourself since you got it all together and know Jesus how about you find yourself at a better place but you got to tell some folks listen I understand what you're trying to do but I'm going to stay focused on the things of God I won't get distracted I won't get pushed to the side I won't get all focused I'm focused on the things that God's called me to do I promise you every discouragement it comes to dissuade you I promise you every mocker comes to get you off of focus I promise you every scoffer comes to take you out of your purpose and the plan that God has for your life but I want to let you know today you are more than a conqueror it doesn't matter what happened it doesn't matter who's trying to get me off course I am more than a conqueror so you've got to be able to release in your spirit that it's not even about you because I understand this thing is not about Flesh and Blood this thing is about the Bible says principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places I'm excited today because oftentimes the people around you that are distracting you that are mocking you that are scoffing at you don't even understand they're just tools to be used by the enemy so why am I not afraid of you why don't I have to cut you off because I have greater the Bible says greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world what do I do I recognize that what God is doing on the inside of me I'm stronger I'm not even worrying about you I'm not even angry at you I'm not even scared of what you're saying why because I know you're just there to discourage and distract some of the pieces and Paths of your life have not been nothing but something to discourage and to distract you from the call and the purpose that God has called over your life I'm calling her out right now anxiety is there to discourage and distract depression is there to discourage and distract addiction is there to discourage and to distract that you cannot do what God has spoken over your life for you to do but if you understand that you are created uniquely to fulfill the will and the purpose that God has over your life you would understand that everything that comes against me is there to discourage me so it can bring what a distraction you don't understand it says in the last and evil days these last times markers are going to come and they're going to walk according to their own way they're going to do their own thing some of us are so caught up in the news some of us are so caught up in the things that are happening in this world that it's nothing but a discouragement and a distraction some of us our focus is so much on what's Happening outwardly that we don't understand what God is doing inwardly some of us are so focused on the kingdom of darkness that we don't understand what's happening in the Kingdom of Light and I'm here today to let you know that God is calling you to understand that mocking is used to discourage [Music] where you feel drained that it's used to discourage where you feel broken at its use to discourage where people are talking about it where people are bringing it up where people are what putting you in a place where they're telling you no no just go the opposite way don't think that don't look that way you know that's too complicated I just I wanted to speak to somebody real quick because what you don't understand is that what people are trying to talk you out of is just a discouragement to be a distraction and why they're trying to talk you out of it is because they actually see it on the inside of you and there's jealousy sitting on the inside and there's unforgiveness and Brokenness and barriers that they don't have the ability to get over but I'm letting you know today that even in the midst of your hurt and your pain even in the midst of people accusing you even in the midst of the most broken things in life you can say father forgive them for they know not what they do I'm trying to let you know there are some people that are being used as tools then they don't even know what they're doing and all you have to do is say father forgive them but I'm still on course I'm still on purpose I'm still walking in my destiny talk about me look at me tell others about me share screenshots of me you can do what you want to do but I want to let you know today is I am focusing the plan and the will of the father I believe today that you have to be convinced and you have to decide no matter what comes my way my answer Lord is yes no matter who says what they say can I tell you every distraction doesn't look like a distraction some distractions look like blessings sometimes we want the approval of people so bad that we don't notice that the thing we've been craving for is actually the thing that's not even God's will for our life we want people to see us and to know us we want to be profound in the things that we do and God has said I'm not here to boast your plan I'm here to boast my plan so I'm here today to let you know don't worry about the mockers they're only there to discourage and discouragement always brings about a sense of a broken purpose and not staying focused on what God's called for you to do and point number three somebody say Point number three I know you're feeling good I know you you're ready you say I'm pointing number three Pastor where are we at Point number three true forgiveness isn't earned it's given there was nothing that the thief from the cross could offer Jesus nothing to be in the moment where he's just so where he's he's so amazing that because of this moment he had he was guilty I want to let you know today you are guilty of sinning against God I am guilty of sinning against God I am guilty of Disobedience I am guilty of doing things my own way I am guilty of having my own thoughts and my own things and my own purpose that I want to live out I am guilty of wanting to live out my own will I am guilty of living from greed and not seed [Music] but I'm so happy today that I have a god who created every part of part of knowing that these broken areas of my life were in me and that what he had set together was a journey and a plan if I was willing to abide abide to it that could free me that could break loose stubbornness and bring in obedience that could put me at a place where my life could change forever where I didn't have to be the same some of us don't understand why we're not as sensitive as we used to be because God has built something up on the inside of us and he's changed us it's not that I'm ignoring you and it's not that I don't hear you it's just not the same for me anymore I have to say this to you today that you can earn God's forgiveness it is a gift that is given to us for God so love the world that he gave Calvary is about the gift that God has given us for us to be United and reconciled to the father sin in Genesis broke it but through the blood of Jesus Christ let's put it back together I I've got to say this to you there's nothing you and I can do the Bible says that can ever separate us from the love of God that says no height nor depth but Angels no principalities it it gives us a context that whether it be things physical or things spiritual nothing separates us from his love but we can truly find ourselves at the place where we get our Focus and we start trying to earn the love of God today Pastor my heart isn't there it isn't ready I I'm not ready to make that decision I just I've got some things I've got to walk through I want to say to you Jesus is willing to wait He Loves You Right Where You Are he truly knows you cannot fix yourself listen y'all I've tried to fix myself I can't do it but a surrender to his will a surrender to his plan a freed heart gives me an opportunity to discover a purpose that he's called me to scripture in Psalms 103. this is verse 10-14 I thought it was important I thought this was a scripture that impacted my heart and I pray that it does yours as well all four verses it says this he does not deal with us according to our sins meaning the punishment that you deserve for the sin that you're guilty of not like him that was blamed falsely this sin that you are guilty of he says he does not deal with us according to our sins nor repay us according to our iniquities for as high as the heavens are above the Earth so great it's his steadfast love toward those who fear Him verse 12 says verse 13 says verse 12 says as far as the East is from the West that is one of the I think that is so funny as you try to think about how close the East is to the West you truly think about the distance of how far the East is from the West it says so great it's his steadfast love it says as far as the East is from the West so far does he remove our transgressions from us that's just a praise moment right there as he removed our sin our Brokenness it says it's from the one you thinking about Biggie and Tupac you think in New York California the Bible says as far as the East is from the West so far does he remove our transgressions from us it says as a father shows compassion to his children so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear Him for he knows oh I love this part verse 14 for he knows our frame he remembers that we are dust Jesus isn't offended because you can't get yourself together he's offended that you won't allow him to do the work inside of you so that he can change you to be who he's called for you to be Jesus doesn't need your help Jesus needs you to release and accept his forgiveness because today I want to let you know you can't earn it because you're going to mess up again I'm going to mess up again but today I can rest thank you Jesus that you haven't rewarded me that you have not dealt with me according to my mess-ups my sins I bless you today man as I've just been thinking about this message and God's been placing I want you to remember differently I want you to remember no more about just being broken and hurt and victimized I want you to remember that you are more than a conqueror that you are not a Survivor but you are a Vic tour through Jesus Christ you're on the other side because you still have purpose God still has a plan and he has still called you today to fulfill his will if you're like me at the end you want to hear him say Well done thy good and faithful sir
