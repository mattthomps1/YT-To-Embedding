[Music] i welcome you to the mix my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i'm so grateful for each and every person that is here and online we are so grateful to have you on today in our week two of our series the crossover and i really believe that god is speaking to us because we are expecting him to speak anybody expecting god to speak yeah i'm expecting him to speak to to say a word in our hearts and in our spirit so that we know what we're called to do next we know where we're called to go we know what he is asking of us today and i really believe the bible says if you seek the lord you shall find him and i believe that we are finding god on today i want you to open your bibles now we're going to get into the word of god uh we're going into the book of numbers numbers chapter 13 and i want to go back into israel and their exodus out of egypt and i want to talk about that today because i believe this series of crossover is going to help you cross over into a you that you have never seen before and that's what i'm believing for this year is that you're not just seeing a replica of you with better habits what i'm believing is that god is doing something new somebody say new on the inside of you that will manifest itself on the outside and will not only impact your life but will impact the lives of so many that are gathering around you that are collectively seeing what god is going to do if you don't hear someone ask you this year what has been happening with you let me tell you you need to pray harder or you need to listen better one of the two and i really believe that because i believe that when god is doing something in your life people are coming to ra around to see what the lord is doing and we're trusting that i want to tell you real quick next week you want to be in the house next week is baptisms y'all uh are you happy we're celebrating people coming to know jesus and making that our decision and making the commitment to know who he is listen as the church that's one of our number one responsibilities is to lead people to know who jesus is and so we're excited every month every fourth sunday when we see people going down in the name of jesus christ and also on next week in the middle of your fasting time in the middle of uh our time of what we're doing 21 days of prayer and fasting we're having a night of worship a night of worship is an opportunity to really understand that god wants to do something even greater he wants to speak even louder and louder doesn't mean in noise it means that he's cancelling out the distractions and those things that are around you that keep you from hearing his voice and worship night gives us an opportunity to sink deeper into the presence of god so you want to join us next sunday at 5 30. uh there is a worship and a word that god has for us in this house and i'm believing that and then in the next two to three weeks you want to be looking out because mixed groups are starting and we're excited about that we believe in community we believe in the culture of community we believe in understanding what god's word says for us and as we follow the word of god we will see him change our life god wants to do something through us god wants to do something for us and god wants to do something in us can i get an amen in the house [Music] numbers chapter 13 we're gonna start at verse 25 israel has come out of egypt their enemies have been destroyed but i want to let you know where one enemy has been destroyed there is another there is another and sometimes the greatest enemy if i can speak this honestly that we deal with is not the enemy that is on the outside it's the enemy within it's the thing that we are trying to break free from it is the thing that we are trying to get ourselves and our minds set free from and so today i want to talk a little bit about what that looks like we're going to start at verse 25 moses in this place has been called to go and look at the promised land and what he does is he pulls a individual a leader from every tribe of israel so there are 12 tribes in israel he pulls out 12 individuals and he tells them to go and spy out the land that the lord has already promised them here's what i want to let you know this promise that god has given them wasn't two years ago wasn't once they got out of uh slavery in egypt this was a promise that he gave to their ancestors abraham and this is what he said to them i want you to go into a land that i've already prepared for you if i could just even tell you right there that's a preaching moment is that god has already prepared a land for you to go in he's not preparing it he's not getting it ready it is already prepared when god gives instructions that means that thing is already done it is just waiting for occupancy and so i'm here today to let you know your destiny is just waiting for occupancy your purpose is just waiting for occupancy and so when god has called you to it don't think he's getting it together you've got to know that thing is already done it is yes and amen the bible lets us know in verse 25 it says at the end of the 40 days they meaning the spies returned from spying out the land and they came to moses and aaron and to all the congregation of the people of israel in the wilderness of paran at kadesh it says they brought that word to them into all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land now here's the understanding is that they were decreed and declared over that what they would be walking into is a land flowing with milk and honey and the land that had fruit that was almost the size of them and god is calling you not to a destiny of just enough he's calling you to a destiny of more than enough and so he's calling them to this they see it and they're here to tell about the story of what they have seen verse 28 says this however the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large and besides he says we saw the descendants of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of negeb the hittites the jebusites the amorites he says dwell in the hill country and the canaanites dwell by the sea and along the jordan sometimes we are noticing the wrong things we're noticing the complications of getting to the blessing instead of noticing the blessings and oftentimes we're talking to god about what's been the problem instead of asking him what the answer is and the bible lets us know is that as they see them he says but caleb quieted the people before moses and said this let us go up somebody say at once and occupy it for we are well able to overcome anybody know you're well able i'm well able to overcome whatever it is that i'm going through whatever it is that may be taking place in this moment i am well able to overcome it it says then the men who had gone up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we are so they brought to the people of israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out saying the land through which we have gone to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people that we saw in it are of great height there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who came from the lefinity meaning giants in the land and we seem to ourselves we seemed to ourselves nobody told me nobody said it nobody i didn't have any haters but it seemed to me that we were like grasshoppers and so we singed to them can i can i tell you people are oftentimes seeing you the way in which you see yourself and today i want to come from the topic your hope is not in vain your hope is not in vain can we pray father in the name of jesus this moment you've given us is a moment where we celebrate and honor all that you're doing i pray today that in this opportunity you would give us this space and moment to be able to hear from you that we would not just be hearers but as hearers we become learners that can be instructed by your word your word can change who we are and in that word changing who we are we become changers in this world and we love you we thank you for what you shall speak we're open to what you want to say in this place in jesus name we say somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians who played this morning and can i tell you i am so grateful for every dream team member that is a part of the mix can y'all help me celebrate our dream team real big around here thank you guys so much those of you in the lobby those of you that are all over this building thank you so much for all that you do i think about that your hope is not in vain and and and it brings me to stories of overcoming anybody like stories of overcoming anybody love those kind of movies where it seems like all hope is lost it seems that the character has no ability to overcome where they are but for some reason and somehow can i tell you they overcome and you just love it at the end just watch this part watch what they do it's the person that all of a sudden notices that life can be different i never forget when my wife and i we first got married back in 2008 and and and and we first got married and then we didn't get married anymore so i just want to let you know it was the first got married and then it was the end got married there there's there's no other marriage in there uh but uh as we were talking about where we were going to go next in our lives because when i believe two people come together their destinies come together as well and i believe that we both had a destiny that we wanted to see for each other and the destiny that we wanted to see for ourselves if i'll drop this nugget real quick if you're single uh one of the best questions to ask someone on a date not on the first one because that might scare them away but on maybe the third or fourth is ask them do you have a vision for your life do you have a vision of where you're going it's it's it's okay to be interested in each other it's so it's okay to have some similarities it's okay to like how each other looks but can i ask at this point in life do you have a vision for where you are going and is your vision more than just potential but are you moving in the place that you will see the seed that is planted bring about fruit that will allow you to be fruitful and not only fruitful but that fruit is called to multiply well i married my wife knowing that she had something on the inside of her that was waiting to be released and i never forget in when before she we got married two weeks before she left her job and i said all right well that's perfect timing and uh what we're doing in this union together um i thought i shared my finances with you but maybe i did not and um we were going to need both uh because we have children so um i'm not sure where god is leading us but we we're gonna need to re look at this and how we're gonna allocate and she just said i know that this isn't for me and the thing that i couldn't uh go against was understanding that uh where there is destiny and purpose lied inside of people there's some people that god is called to support and be around and so here's what i want to let you know if you aren't available to support the closest people in your life to their destiny god will send someone else to do what it is that you have not taken the responsibility to do and so as a husband i was going to let nobody else come in and support my wife's vision and dreams outside of me so what i made a decision to do was say okay let's talk about working this out and i'll never forget she said i want to start a daycare i said that sounds amazing she says i want to start it in the home i said whose because the way that i'm looking at it our home already has a daycare because we've got three kids i'm not sure if we can take any more and i'll never forget before we even got engaged she i asked her this was a question so i can be honest in it i said what do you want to do and she says i want to provide a place where i was absent of that there were women that would somebody would be able to help people go further while they had kids and would consider the life that they were trying to make for themselves how hard it was and that they would work with them and help them and i'll never forget and that was like in october of the year before and and so she started living that out and we had two kids in the house okay that wasn't too bad and and and and i would wait i was working here at the church as an administrator and a and a finance uh uh individual and and i never forget i would be like okay so they get they leave at six which means i'm going to leave work at 5 45 so i don't have to run into these children well it didn't work out that way because you know when you start a business you're looking for the closest people to to kind of be with you in the business and and guess what it was her friend so when her friends came over they didn't really pick up their kids real quick they stayed and talked and had these moments together and i'd be sitting there like when tom are y'all going home your children have been here for about 10 to 11 hours it's time to go i'll never forget we worked this and then we moved and she still worked it and time went on where what seemed like was supposed to be what god was doing in her life extended beyond the time that we preferred it to extend and i'll never forget it took seven years of her working the promise that she believed in the destiny that god had set on her heart that she had to work it out and i'll never forget being at a conference and i was walking in the parking lot and my wife called me right before i got into the service and she said to me i want to let you know i finally have a building can i tell you the excitement that came in my life that i would no longer have to see children as i walked down my steps i would no longer have to miss oh excuse me is that your hand little boy i'm sorry that would no longer have to be our mornings that we would have the freedom that god called me to have i want to say this to you that oftentimes there is a promise and then there is a season of wait there's a promise and then there's a season of waiting what happens in the waiting in the waiting this process in the waiting there are things that are worked outside of us there are things that are are are groomed outside of us that are putting us in the place where we operate differently than when we first started with the promise i don't know if you remember david but david was crowned he was anointed king but he wasn't crown king until many years later i'm here today to let you know that the promise that you got is not laying dormant the promise that you have is not broken it's not messed up what i want to tell you today is that you're just in the season of process and what you need to know is that your hope is not in vain what you're believing god for what you're believing god to do in your life what you are expecting god to take you to it's not in vain i want to get you to the word of god because it feels like i felt seven years and things feeling uncomfortable and and here's what i want to let you know you don't get to live in comfort while in process comfort and process don't usually go together there's a season of discomfort there's a season of walking in a space where you're just like this doesn't feel like i know what to feel that's right because god is working some things on the inside of you you're used to everything being one way god saying i've got to change it and get you used to being structured another way he's breaking some habits while creating new ones he's opening doors while shutting other ones he's changing relationships while giving you new ones he is creating in you something somebody say new something new something that will stand something that will have a firm foundation so israel is at this place where they have received a promise hundreds of years before they're right on the edge of canaan and the bible lets us know that they get to this place where they're recognizing that they're they're right there they're they're they're right where they're supposed to be and and the bible lets us know that moses sends out the 12 spies and he and he says to them i want you to go spy out the land go spy out your purpose sometimes you're in places that you feel uncomfortable about because you're spying out what god has for you in the future i don't know if somebody even caught that the reason why you should catch that really well is because you feel awkward where you are because it's not your current location it's where you're going to get to so when you enter into a new space stop seeing the newness of it as a sign of i don't need that because oftentimes god has you to go into areas that you've never been in before because you're spying out your destiny sometimes you're spying out the very place that god will take you to sometimes you're spying out the very position that god has for you sometimes you're spying out the very things that you never thought would be yours god is saying i want you to go take a look at it i freed you from some things but now i want to put you in an awkward place god this could never be me i could never walk in that place that could never be how i'm doing it and god is saying i need you to go spy out the land because there are some things i need for you to see yes you don't see yourself doing it right now yes you don't see yourself having the resource but i want to let you know god is already showing you what he has for you your hope is not in vain what you've been longing for what you've been asking god for what you've been on 21 days of prayer and fasting and and what you've been giving up food for has a purpose behind it it is not in vain what happened was they finally came to realize the land of milk and honey and they saw before themselves something they had never seen before i want to let you know you've been walked into the home you have walked into the job you've walked into the dealership you've walked into the position and it is scaring the mess out of you that's sprite because it's supposed to because what god was building for you was exceeding and abundantly more than you could even ask or think and the reason it scares you is because it's more than you thought you would ever have i'm preaching this to you because you need to stop allowing your fear of where you are currently to control the destiny of what you do in your process what's happening in your process is taking you through and building you for what you've just seen but here's what two things when you spy out your destiny can happen it can even place greater doubt in your ability to get to what god has already called you to have or it can require of you the spirit of faith to be able to believe in something that you know you have no business with your hands on all that stuff you did all that junk you talked out your mouth when you were out there all that disobedience that you were doing before you knew god god said you have no business but he said i had already destined it for you so no matter how much you may have messed it up before what i have destined for your life and call for you has to actually happen because i'm a god of my word that's why you can't send your way out of your anointing and your blessing why because what god is destined for you is for you you're talking about what you messed up how much you messed up who you mess up with and god is saying all i need you to do is get in alignment and when you get an alignment it don't matter how much you doubt it it doesn't matter how much you talked about it it doesn't matter how much you want to even go back to egypt i'm letting you know that destiny is still awaiting you your hope is not in vain they got an ability to be able to spy out the land the problem is is that when you spy on the land the wrong way when you walk into something not seeing how you can conquer it but you're walking in to see how it can conquer you there's amla kites there's jebusites there's the annex that are greater than you what you're doing is you're creating within yourself an understanding that even though something has been promised it's still not for you the idea that god would promise them a land hundreds of years ago that he intended for them to have and that he wouldn't bring them to that point they believed that what was in the promise was greater than the promise and what's in the promise or what is trying to keep you from the promise can never keep you from what's already yours because what's already yours has been declared yours the issue about what has already been declared that is yours is that there's always an enemy who is trying to keep you from what you're supposed to have there is no possession without a fight what god is calling you to it's not without a battle you're not walking into it you're not sliding your way through it you actually have to muster up the faith to believe that god has something more for you even though what he has for you is intimidating it's greater than the resources that i have it's greater than what i have in my bank account it's greater than the amount of people and networking that i've done to give me the influence to be in the space what you must understand about it is that it's already yours the requirement is possession and possession doesn't come without a fight and a fight doesn't come without a battle and a battle doesn't come without some bruises what we're trying to do is fight a fight without any bruises and the problem is is you will get hit but whether you get hit or not it's still yours my question that i ask is why would we allow the enemy to take possession of something that's not his but that god has already declared ours why would we give it to him without a fight because we're scared of some bruises the picture that i want to be able to paint for you in this moment is that some of us are suffering with the spirit of doubt over our life that we don't have the ability to see any further than the things that are offered to us that look like they don't hurt you're trying to find let me talk to someone in here who's in relationship you're trying to find a relationship that doesn't hurt because you were hurt in the relationship before but you can't get into a new relationship without hurt being a part of the process and the greatest fear that we have is being hurt no the greatest fear should be not possessing not the wounds that heal we're trying to come out of the battle unscathed but the problem is that makes no sense in a battle your destiny is promised to you but it doesn't mean that there's a possibility you won't lose something and i think the idea that we've created in the world is a perception that i can invest without risk even the world knows that doesn't make sense at the end the investment through time will bring a return that you'll see but it's within the process of the investment that it will have its ups and downs i'm pretty sure that they knew that there would be some losses in this war but what they said to themself is the land wasn't worth it enough to lose anything the bible lets us know that they they they come out of the land and and they look at the land and they're like this land is amazing it's amazing it's the land flowing with milk and honey it's not literally lakes of milk and honey everybody it is an expression like we have like a language that we explain you know how we do man that's crazy crazy means good man i'm telling you that joint is what's up wait what so milk and honey is the verbiage to man that joint was crazy we went into the land that was crazy well what happened listen do you see this fruit that we have the the bible says they had to cut the fruit off the branch and carry it with two people somebody's blessing today is so great that you need help [Music] with it we pray for fruitfulness but we only want fruitfulness we can handle and the bible says i'm trying to give you exceedingly abundant so when god does abundant he gives you so much that you need somebody to help you with the abundance god can bless you so good that it scares you wait what how much oh no no no no no no you're not gonna do that with me i'm not gonna be responsible for that god will give you a position at your job so great that you'll stand there and look at me say i i don't even qualify for this and we will bring doubt to our own destiny because we're fearful of the fruitfulness of what it could be some of you haven't invested because you're actually scared of how far it will go not how much it won't even do and you don't know or have a plan for if it blows up of what you will do so you stay in a complacent place that you can handle instead of asking god who are you partnering me with that can help me carry my fruit [Music] who did you connect me with why why are we we're in this awkward place at this church with this weird thing why because god's called me to connect to somebody who's here to help with my fruitfulness because my fruitfulness has to multiply because the bible says we're called to be fruitful and multiply so fruitfulness brings multiplication that's why the enemy sows the seed of doubt in many and out of the 12 spies only two came back with a good report there's three things that you will need the holy spirit to help you overcome the first thing is that you'll need to overcome surrounding doubt there are people in your vicinity who do not see the promise like you and the problem that you have is that you're waiting for them to capture what you're capturing and the problem of it is is that what god has taken you through in process is not what everyone else has gone through in process i've noticed my faith can be different than some people that i grew up with faith because we've made different choices i was choosing god when i had nothing some people were choosing god once they got something i was like man i'm trusting me no matter what we look like right now like we're gonna trust we got no choice matter of fact this is the non-choice season of my life to trust the lord i'm rolling dice like i'm crazy right now so i started rolling dice before i had anything so i made the decision early i was just going to continue rolling up god's like we're calling you to build a church all right let's go let's go all right looks like it's it let's roll is it going to work i'll never forget saying this to our overseer i have no clue because it's not my responsibility the only thing i'm responsible for is the word that god gives me what did the word that god give egypt i have a promised land for you i'm going to take you to it what was their responsibility then take us how are we going to go there's annex there's jebusites there's amla kites how are we going to overcome it he would have told him we're going to fight we're going to fight but we're the people of god and you promised it to us i didn't promise you without a fight if you go to jericho you'll notice there was a fight if you look at ai there were lives lost there was a fight i want to let you know today it's so important is that you have to overcome surrounding doubt i want to put you at ease some of your closest friends and family will not be on board until later it has nothing to do with their love for you it has everything to do with that's not their promise so look for the people whom god set around you to get you to that space instead of staying with the people around you who you have expectations of but they cannot fulfill them so now you're battling with your destiny and purpose and your feelings because your mama don't believe it then you have to be okay with your mama waiting until you get there while you fulfill the promise that god has for your life and you can say to them later i hold no grudges you just didn't hear what god promised me [Music] you didn't hear it you weren't there on that night you weren't there when i was on my knees and i was crying and begging god please if you would just use me if you would just use me if you would just use me i'll do whatever it is you want me to do you weren't there for the moment so i can't expect the same from you i can't expect it from you i understand it i'm not mad at you i'm okay you didn't support i'm all right that you didn't give me a hand clap i'm okay why because i knew this day was coming my hope was not in vain and sometimes what is delaying the movement of the destiny that god has over your life is your ability to move without surrounding people's agreement you don't know why you're over there looking at that house you know you can't afford it oh look at oh oh this is nice you know we can't afford it yes yes i do but it's not going to stop me from looking because something in me gives me a draw to something i've never seen before and there's some things that you promised me that your word says are beyond what i could imagine or think is this a possibility for my life how do you overcome surrounding doubt you silence it the bible says caleb got up and silenced the crowd sometimes you gotta walk it i can't even tell y'all this story yet because it's to come so i'll wait i'll wait on it but i'll tell you a piece of it with very general details [Laughter] but i was at a police looking at a thing all right y'all with me i was at a police looking at a thing as i was looking at the thing a person said to me you know there are some other competing individuals who have a better picture than you i stopped right there i said here's the thing the problem is is they don't have god's promise there was a quick silence you ain't got no clap back for that i was like all right silence sometimes you just need to tell the people around you just i know what god's doing you think you can i got this i know the promise because sometimes if you let it in it'll take root if you let the doubt in if you if you let the confusion in if you let someone just tell you their version of your vision from god they will smear that thing so bad that you won't have a vision and you'll be going back to your bed like did i i don't know maybe i didn't hear from you know what that is a bad idea you know what i'm not even going to look at that no more just forget it you have to silence your surrounding doubters solace it with your actions that's how you really make people quiet you don't really do that yeah i am so i got to see you later because i'm about to go handle that you for real yeah yeah i'm real for real i'm i'm real real not just real i'm real real it ain't real until i got two on it that's what i learned and then you you you silence it at the end with your testimony hey i just want to welcome you to the new place that you thought i wasn't going to be able to have because you thought i didn't have the resources to be able to do it and i just wanted to welcome you to the opening of our new space you do it nice and lovely and gentle and you were my first invite i wanted to give this card to you personally here you go and we have reserved seating right at the front for you just show people with your actions you have to keep telling people over and over we said that last week do what say less point number two you've got to overcome godly doubt what's godly doubt the doubt that god wouldn't do this for me i i've done way too much for god to do this for me i do not qualify for god to do this for me i i've had too many moments too many mistakes i just i can't see god even considering this for me i just haven't been wise and there is no way because the bible tells me that god would do something like that for a person like me here's what i want to let you know today is that your canaan is already done it's just waiting for your possession god did not destin you after he met you let me see what she does first and then i'll make a decision on the way god isn't preparing it according to what you do and he's making it up like oh yeah ooh yeah no no you know what i ain't gonna do that no more forget that you know i'm so mad at them no god's like destiny he's like you he's like as soon as you get in alignment with me i'll put you in alignment with it that's it what you're fighting now is your own spiritual warfare of you getting through your own process and god is just waiting he says oh yeah that never moved it was already completed it was already done it was already there i had already built it up for you it's already together i'm just waiting on you and that's the question behind it that you keep asking yourself would god do this for me and i'm here to let you know god already did it it's not will he do it's he's already done it that's the mindset change you think god is putting it together as we go god is not putting your life together as you live it it's already done if you operated out of the mindset that already what god has shown me is already done then you would just flow in it and stop asking god do you qualify for it it's basically like a job that says as soon as you get here you automatically have this you keep walking up well you know i didn't do the qualifications here's here's what you're imparting you're you're you're a part of an inheritance inheritances we don't work for we just get them why do you get them i'm just a son and daughter it's a part of what i'm called to do you meet the qualifications nope not really [Laughter] do you have all the knowledge no not really so why do you qualify i'm his son and it's a part of my inheritance that was given before the work even was done you see it as a working towards god says it's my inheritance given over to you as a son and daughter you're not working for your destiny you're inheriting what is already yours [Music] that's different you think you're working for it as it goes and builds god says no it's an inheritance well why it's an inheritance because it was already saved up for you what if you lived your life like you were going to inherit not like you had to earn you would be bolder in your 21 days of prayer you'll be trying to unmute the button on the zoom call real quick can i share a testimony real quick or what the lord has done no no you cannot we we have a schedule oh okay can you let me know real quick when that is so i could make sure i let you know what god did for me [Applause] uh no we cannot if you could get the mixed church app we will let you know [Music] because you would be praying in such a way that you knew you already had it you would be asking god just how do i get it and what are the requirements in order for me to inherit your prayers wouldn't be well if you want to and you think about it and if today's a good day for you to be able to do it god then maybe we could possibly look at what are you asking for i want to know if i can have what you've already set aside for me it's already yours you're not working for it you're living for it and point number three you've got to overcome self-doubt it's one of the greatest things that's wearing you out it's what's happening within we can blame our haters we can blame our doubters we can blame that we aren't prepared and we don't have the requirements we can we can give all of that you can tell the story all day but the greatest struggle that we're having is the struggle within ourselves it's not about do you believe god it's not about is he able it's not about the giants of the land it's about what's with inside of you do you believe that you're more than a conqueror the bible lets us know in proverbs 23 and 7 it says so as a man thinketh so is he they said we seem as to ourselves as grasshoppers so in response to the way we saw ourselves is the way in which they saw us if you've been chipping away at life for people to feel sorry for you then the way you'll live out your life as a victim will be the way in which you get through life and then you'll say stop looking at me like i can't do something will you keep presenting yourself right as a victim instead of a conqueror you need to walk in as a conqueror so that they see you as a conqueror but you have to see it within your self there is a promise to you from god but its possession is not based on you seeing it it's based on you believing it's yours your possession of what god has for you is not about how much he shows you that's our prayer half the time god show me god show me if you show me and you and god's like i've done that before i've shown them they still didn't believe me because if they didn't believe within it was never going to transfer to who they were without and they would never possess something they never thought was theirs you'll never take a hold of that in which you believe is not yours how do you overcome self-doubt admit where it is in mark chapter 9 the father said to jesus he said if you can [Music] you heal my son jesus said if i can he said i can do anything where's your faith he said lord i believe but help my unbelief i walked into a a place with some people and i knew it i knew it was something that god was doing i just didn't know what he was doing and so instead of fronting like i had it all together spiritually i walked in and said there's some unbelief in this moment will you help me one thing i learned from the bible is jesus never left his disciples because of their areas of unbelief if you find out any time when there was a storm on the boat and the boat was rocking and they said jesus we're going to perish and jesus came up and spoke to the winds and the waves and he said peace be still he didn't leave him he just said oh you a little faith did he still do it that's that's that's the part you're worrying about how clean you looking good you look as a christian my question is did he still do it did he still honor the request jesus is walking out on the water the disciples are further along in the sea it's the middle of the night jesus starts walking on the water he scares the daylights out of his disciples when peter understands it's jesus he says lord if it's you bid me to come do you not know that jesus already knew that peter had doubt on the inside of him yet peter still walked on water and jesus honored the request what if jesus still honored the request in spite of your unbelief [Music] what if what if you could be honest and just be like i believe but help the areas that i'm still struggling and jesus said that's all i wanted from you is to admit that you need me [Music] you're never gonna have it all together never gonna have it all figured out but if you could just tell jesus i believe my help my unbelief [Music] help the areas well i don't know if it's gonna work but i'm walking anyway if you say bit me to come i'm coming but inside of me i'm scared but but i'm coming but i just don't know what's gonna happen and i'm gonna step out and you you're gonna call me on my faith and i'm okay with that but you still allow me to step out and you still worked it out for my good then i'll take it [Music] jesus is not here to make you feel like you're more of a mess he said i come that you might have life i have it more abundantly how much more do you need of him i'm here today to let you know your hope is not in vain what he has for you is yours in your areas of unbelief the areas in when you believe if you could just submit to him lord i'm just struggling in some areas but i believe you and i take a hold of your word and i know your promises are yes and amen i've just never been this way before if you could help my on but had they said the land had the annex and the land had giants and the land had inhabitants that were huge and i think we would get devoured but i believe that if he said it's ours then we can conquer so help my unbelief as i walk into battle [Music] i think they could have conquered that day [Music] or help out unbelief i just want to let somebody know this morning your hope is not in vain what you've been asking god for it's not in vain [Music] we're on day 8 of 21 days in prayer don't you stop don't you stop praying don't you stop fasting because your hope is not in vain it's not a it's not over it's not a done deal don't you quit in the middle because god has more than you can imagine of me in jesus name i want to pray this morning [Music] father in the name of jesus i believe through your word today so we understand there's some areas of doubt we've got some people around us who are dialing our vision the vision which you gave us lord we have vision but we don't believe are worthy enough for it and we're struggling within to believe that we're worthy enough for even the opportunities and doors that you have opened up right before our eyes [Music] i pray today whether we've been saved many years or today's our first day that in our hope that we would rest and understand it's not in fame and that we could settle today that everything you have for us has already been declared yes and amen we give our doubt over to you for you to do whatever it is that you want to do with it to help us to move forward and our broken areas are not so broken areas and the areas that we've conquered we give it steel all over to you for we love you we honor and thank you in jesus name
