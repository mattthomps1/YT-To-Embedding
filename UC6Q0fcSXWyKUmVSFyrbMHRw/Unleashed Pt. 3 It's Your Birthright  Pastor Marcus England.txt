[Music] thank you we are in a series if you are new which is called Unleashed and we are in our third week the third installment of this series and the idea behind this series is the clarity and understanding that everything that we see so far in our life is not everything that God has for us we truly believe that there is something on the inside of you there is potential there are possibilities that God has laid inside of you that are greater than what you've ever experienced what you've ever imagined for the Bible says there are things that no eye has seen and no ear is heard and no mind has conceived that God has in store for those and whom love him and I believe this today is that there is something that God is waiting to do in your life that has not been Unleashed but that he is waiting for your yes and Your Surrender so that he can move into a even newer direction of what he has called you to be he wants to see out of you the more than the Conqueror he wants to see out of you the individual that as Ephesians 2 and 10 says is the Masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for good works he does not have an interest in seeing you being a carbon copy of what has already existed he has no interest of seeing you be like everyone else and to do like everyone else God has said that you are unique You Are Made In His Image and in his likeness and we believe through that there is something that needs to be Unleashed in you we're going to turn in our bibles if you open up your Bibles open up your no pass we really believe God speaking in Genesis chapter after 25. Genesis chapter 25 and we're laying this groundwork as we are giving a lesson today I'm going to extrapolate the idea and the context of this message and this idea of this passage of a story about two brothers Baltimore twins and what the importance is of understanding what God has placed inside of you these young men are sons of Isaac Isaac is the son of Abraham Abraham is the father of Israel and the promise that is given to Abraham through God is that he will be the father of many nations Abraham is given a promise but oftentimes when God promises us things we tend to take his promise into our own hands we have the idea that we can do better than God we can go faster than God we have a clear vision of how we want it and so we tend to take over that in which God is spoken and we take it into our own hands and then scripture we'll see is that God has no favorites but he does have favor and as God moves in favor there's an understanding to this idea that from that lineage of Abraham there was a blessing he told Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 I will bless you so that you can be a blessing that's what we spoke today that's what we have believed in 2023 that every blessing that God blesses us with is a opportunity for us to be a blessing we get to a part in this story where we understand Jacob is one whom is close to home he is one in whom is it's not like his brother Esau Esau is a hunter he is a Wilderness man he is one who goes after uh his game and his haunt and so Esau finds himself at a place at verse 29 where it comes in and it says this once when Jacob was cooking stew it said Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted somebody say exhausted and Esau said to Jacob let me eat some of that red stew for I am exhausted it says therefore his name was called Edom I can understand Jacob's feeling I mean Esau's feeling if you've been on 21 days in prayer and fasting and you've been fasting from anything you feel when you see a good meal when you go past a good restaurant if you feel a whiff in your nose [Music] you will look and say my God what is that when it comes to the point of making this negotiation Jacob said sell me your Birthright sell me your heirship sell me the order of which God has birthed us for sell this to me because Jacob saw value I mean Esau's Birthright Esau said I'm about to die of what use is a Birthright to me now if you've had children before you know this expression if you had kids if you watched kids before what happens when they're hungry Mom I'm about to die Dad I am so hungry I am starving after six bags of chips and snacks that you've packed away in the car this child is still hungry and so they're sad I'm desperately hungry Jacob said swear to me now so he swore to him and sowed his Birthright to Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil soup stew now I don't know about you but if I'm going to sell my Birthright it bet to be something worth me selling it for now I'm not against anybody at all who's vegan I like this lifestyle for 21 days [Music] but what I won't do is trade my Birthright for some lentil beans I've had beans for the last two weeks I know the tastes of them I know the texture of them I know that they can be feeling but they are not words a Birthright he says Jacob gave Esau Jacob gave Esau bread it must be the bread that Pastor Ty talked about that's in Philly that comes out of this special water that they have in Philly I told him it's polluted water that's what it is but he gave him bread and lentil soup and he ate and drank and Rose and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright I want to come from the topic today it's your Birthright your Birthright can we pray father today help me help us to understand our Birthright in Jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians y'all can you help me celebrate the people that make it happen here help me give it up for our Dream Team I think it's important that we take this opportunity to pull from this message about understanding what God has afforded to each and every one of us through his son Jesus Christ in order to understand this idea perspective as a as a certain culture that we do not have a a a great grasp on because we are a democratic-based society what we want to talk about is the idea of being heir to of having inheritance of having this idea that something is old to me not because I deserve it not because I've worked for it it's just because I was born into it with me but I I've never found that as far as I know that I have been born into a royal Heritage my last name is England but as you can see I am not a part of the Royal Family I really believe that that that there is something unique and special as scripture lets us know that we are a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for a good work but none of us and maybe you are I don't know but I have not been born into royalty I I do not have a inheritance that I'm waiting on that it's just because I was born there's nothing available to me that said because I came out of the womb this is what I have in store for me and and and I can look at that and say that's a privileged lifestyle uh but I really don't understand it because I I've been born into something that doesn't automatically give you the privilege or the right because you're born if you've been aware of what's been happening in in England in London England you you know that Queen Elizabeth has passed away and and the queen passing away that means there was an heir that was to the throne the air to the throne was Prince Charles and and and Prince Charles was heir to the throne which means as soon as Queen Elizabeth died he took into inheritance his heirship it wasn't because he earned it it wasn't because he had done anything well it was just because he was born first he was born first and he had a he it means he had the privilege he had he had an opportunity to a lifestyle just because of who he is I don't know about you and I but oftentimes I I have privilege to a lifestyle but the problem is is according to the way my life has been built it's a different kind of privilege some of you have grown up in a large home some of you have grown up in a small home some of you have found yourself in a place where you've been in an apartment some of you have found yourself in a place where you've been in a condo all of us have grown up into whatever it is that the situation was at the time which means that we are a part of the condition of whatever the set of circumstances are in the moment Prince Charles has the ability to be born and to a monarchy a British Monarchy that gives him privilege to be able to have certain things to live in certain places to have certain rights and abilities to be able to do and and in life that doesn't sound too bad I mean I would not mind having someone come and pick me up I wouldn't mind security walking around the mall with me as I didn't window shot but I just shot you understand what I'm saying I I did what I would like to do as I walk around I I wouldn't mind being able to to live out a luxury life where where I could stay where I want to and go where I want to and and have opportunities that no one else has but here's the thing while we always see there's greatness involved there's always a price to pay for being connected to something great when we're looking in scripture we we understand in thought and process that that we we are what's called if you look uh Through the Bible we were called uh Gentiles which means that we are non-jewish people that have been invited into this promise into uh the son and daughtership with God and and we have now become a part of the kingdom of God I want to let you know we are now a part of a kingdom kingdom meaning there is one king and we are a part of his kingdom this is not the Democracy of God this is not we vote him in we ask him for what we want we see if we feel like doing it what the bible let us know as we talked about last week in Romans chapter 12 it said that we're called to offer our bodies what as living sacrifices holy and acceptable unto God for this is our reasonable service when we offer ourselves we start finding out that we do not have the luxury of any more of doing what we want to do because we are part of somebody say a kingdom the kingdom means that the responsibility of my direction is in the hand of the king but the issue is is I have to make the decision will I do what the king is asking or will I go my way here's the thing about the king the king always has in mind what is best for somebody say the kingdom and as we operate with the king who knows what's best for the kingdom he is no longer just thinking about him but he is thinking about the welfare of all now here in a democracy this thing is all about me I don't care who gets elected into office there is an agenda somebody say an agenda now we don't have to talk politics for what we do to recognize is there's always an agenda to a reason that I want to do and go I want to help the people but I also want to make sure there's my agenda that gets across here in the Kingdom we're not worrying about an agenda our agenda is God's agenda our direction is God's direction we say wherever he leads me I will follow and we make a decision it's no longer about me it's all about him when we come into this Clarity I think what we're understanding is that through a con uh a concept of what a kingdom is it's looking at it that there is a king and the Jews are those who are a part of that Kingdom and heirs but the Bible says that Jesus Christ came so that we could actually get in on a promise that was promised to a group of people who rejected it and he said I'm just crazy enough to open this thing up to you even though you don't even deserve it the Bible lets us know that we find ourselves in a place where he says I'm going to open this up and now you have citizenship somebody say citizenship say s citizenship means that I've got the same rights being someone who is a Birthright of the kingdom of God it means that everything and every promise that God has said over the life of Israel as a promise said over me here's what I understand is that now I am no longer on the outside but I'm on the inside Romans chapter 8 verse 17 says this and if we are his children then we are his somebody say heir okay anybody know what the air is an heir is someone who is in right to what is next this is it's getting good to me before it's getting good to you because the thing that I know on the other side of this is that being in Heir means I don't have to work for anything because whatever God has promised me it's already mines the Bible says it is yes and amen so I get excited because what I understand is that if it was up to me I would disqualify myself every time I went off path every time I got destructive in my thinking every time I started to think about me and Minds I still need to understand that I am a part of the kingdom and citizenship of God the scripture lets me know that we are also Heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ sharing in what his spiritual blessing and his inheritance right there is an opportunity for you to get up go in the back shout in the corner and come back into your seat because what you don't understand is that the inhere contents of Christ is your inheritance as well I want to get somebody just to give me a quick Amen on that part it says if indeed we share in his suffering so that we may also share in his glory today I it's exciting for me to talk to you that it's your Birthright because become Dia is is that oftentimes you believe you're stuck where you are and I'm here to let you know you're not stuck where you are you just don't understand what's owed to you Pastor what are you saying what's old to me anybody ever been there before you heard about a claim anybody ever got the phone call that hey if you did this or you had possible lead pain you could be in store for millions of dollars anybody ever heard that I never forget going to my mother and said did we have lead in the house because if so [Music] I could be a possible recipient of some money I want to get you to the point that you can actually exist in the joy that God has for you because there's an anticipation of Hope of what God is going to do in your life because you now understand that you're connected not to a church but to a kingdom and if you're connected to a kingdom it means that you have Airship which means there is an inheritance that's waiting on you now I want to tell you something about an inheritance an inheritance oftentimes has to be given once someone has died here's what I want to let you know is that the Bible lets us know that Jesus Christ died on calvary's Cross but here's the thing about it he rose again with all power in his hand what does that say that says to me that since he died he owes me what he owes me because I have an inheritance in him it don't matter if he got back up he owes me because what I'm a child of his so what I understand is that I do for an inheritance I'm due for an inheritance because there's something about being a son and daughter of God that helps me to understand that there is a right that I have to walk in his presence the Bible says come boldly before the throne of grace where you may be able to obtain Health in the time of need how do I walk in boldness I walk in boldness when I know that's my daddy all I got to say is I could go to him for anything I can ask him for anything I can declare anything over my life why because he's given me permission to do so what I understand today is a hair inheritance is in store for me because it's my Birthright somebody say it's my Birthright the blessings that God has promised the blessings that God has in store for me it's my Birthright so what I've got to understand is now I need to start living as if there's something coming to me you ever been there before and you knew that check I mean come on now some some of y'all are professional car accident lawyer having people I mean I mean there's some people I know they just they got a lawyer waiting in the pocket you're like hey I was in an accident call my friend Johnny sink Tire wait what he will hook you up he's got listen Johnny will get you the money you need some of us are trying by accident to receive an inheritance but some of us already know an inheritance is already afforded to me when I have an idea that there's an inheritance already afforded to me I live as like one who knows that they're about to receive what God has in store for them so I start building and acting like one and who knows okay let me go real quick to the car dealership to see what I'm about to buy because I understand as soon as this check comes I'm about to be in for it I'm crazy enough to believe that I'm going to start living and acting like I've already got it the manifestation somebody say it's on the way the Bible says let thy will be done on Earth as it's already what declared what in heaven so if it's already in heaven that means there is a somebody say there's a Payday there's a Payday of blessings that are on their way that I am ready and I don't even want to have room to receive because I'm ready for an overflow I'm just waiting I'm going shop real quick I'm gonna go over here and make sure my children are in order because we are about to receive the best that God has for me let me line this thing up properly let me make sure I got what I need to have why because my life is about to change why is your life about to change cause I haven't inherited why are you looking at new things that you can't afford cause I'm believing already by faith that God has it in store for me I'm already declaring my inheritance is on the way but I have a Birthright I understand that weeping may endure for a night but I understand Joy comes in the morning when when you when you're entitled you walk home you ever seen an entire person oh you didn't know who I am you did you did you didn't know I was coming you you didn't see that I was going to be here today here's what I want you to understand and believe about what God is doing in your life is that you need to walk as one who is a kingdom kid who already has the inheritance so when people ask you why are you acting like that and why are you thinking about stuff you've never seen before why are you expecting God to move in a supernatural way you say because it's already a part of my inheritance I saw it I'm just waiting on it because the blessings that God already has in store for me I'm excited just to be a part of it so right now in the atmosphere I understand that what I see isn't what it already is I'm already recognizing that there is greater in store so what do I do I just sit back and say God you just let me know when payday is coming because when the blessings come it doesn't just hit me but it hits everything I'm connected to you know how when you get excited when you gotta check and you start taking over the bill hey I'll pay for this one what happened to you something changed on the inside of me something declares something on the inside I've got a new way of thinking and seeing because there's an inheritance in store for me the greatest thing that the enemy wants to do is to give you an idea and perspective that you are not worth who God says you are we often often humble but the problem is is we don't talk about being insecure and the humility that we're oftentimes trying to make sure we have is included with a sense of insecurity and so we're apologetic about who we are what we do and the way God's called so we live and live with our heads held down always saying I'm sorry instead of saying I want you to know that this was in store for my life from the beginning you think it's arrogant it's a promise that's over my life so I already understand you can see me the way you want to see me but what I've already done is grabbed a hold of the promise of God and the promise of God lets me know that I am in the air and enjoying air with Christ so since I'm in enjoying air do not be angry at me because I trust my father yeah if I can trust my father I could trust him for anything if you trusted God you would think further than where your resources and your connections could get you would extend your faith to a place that you can't even imagine or think what you got next plan man we're looking at buying a couple of properties you you don't even have a house yet oh I didn't tell you about the inheritance coming in what inheritance God already promised it it's not my responsibility to bring it into fruition it's my responsibility to believe by faith that God can do what he says to do the Bible lets us know he said according to your faith it shall be done but the idea is if I don't have the faith to believe and I don't put work into that Faith then guess what the promises of God stay right where they are so I live with a belief and a knowledge and guess what a vision of what God can do but I don't live it out because I don't have the faith to actually see it take place in my life but if I gathered myself to believe that God had an inheritance already in store for me that I wasn't willing to give up my Birthright for the things of this world but that I was ready to put myself in position to say God whatever it is that you want to do I just want to let you know I'm on board tell your neighbor get on board I think if I got on board with it I'd have an opportunity to possess everything God has for me you can call me arrogant you can call me braggadocious you can call me I'm too confident I don't care you didn't hear when God spoke to me with tears running down my eyes when I didn't think I was going to make it and I thought I was going to lose my mind I don't know if I'm talking to anybody else but he whispered to me in the middle of the night oh baby I want to let you know this thing's gonna be all right Joy will come in the morning I promise you everything you're looking at everything you're looking for it's on its way because there's inheritance waiting for you foreign we have to stop conceptualizing what everyone else thinks about us and put ourselves in the place where we understand the blessings of God aren't even for me they're a testimony of his goodness stop looking and being angry or jealous or compromising or or comparing yourself and start saying God I if you have no favorites foreign if you don't have any favors that means you got to do it for me anybody crazy enough to ask God to do something for them that they see for somebody else God you bless them why you I want to know why but why why why why where's mines where where's where's Minds see when you're a child and you know your father you react differently than everyone else is acting they see the mean person I don't know you know I don't talk to your father he you know he angry all the time and everybody else on the inside knows what ain't angry he just act that way I gotta solve hard don't even worry about it I'll go ask him when you know that you go on the inside and say if you knew like I knew what God could do for you in your life you would ask him the same way but because you feel like you're an orphan you act like an orphaned Christian who doesn't have an inheritance and who doesn't have rights to the things that God has and so you look at me with a sense of I wish I had what they had I wish I could do what they do and God said I already pushed it inside of you I just need you to unleash it I'm tired of you looking around for what is inside of you already I dare you look inside and say God open me up to everything you have inside of me so that I can be a blessing and we can sit side by side and say is it the Lord good and you can answer back to me yes he is tell me what he did for you if you had an understanding of what God did for my life you would lose it right now I'd be like bet I'll let let try me cause I've got a story on the goodness and the favor of the Lord over my life because it's been my Birthright since the beginning once I begin to understand everything that God has for me is mines I walk with my head up and say you can have it too you just gotta join in but the problem is it's like he saw is that we allow things to get in the way we're exhausted and the reason why we're exhausted is because we're trying to do it our own way exhausted from overthinking exhausted from trying to figure out how you're going to do it exhaust it from your plans not working anybody know you just exhausted anybody know you're you're at a place where it's just like God if you don't help me I'll live in it and some of us are living at a point of exhaustion we're tired we've been doing it by ourselves for a long time we're finding ourselves in the place where we we can't figure this thing out to save our life but the scripture says in Matthew 11 28 it says come to me all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads and I will give you rest he didn't say work harder he didn't say burn yourself out said come to me anybody know that adulting and life can be hard anybody know being a teenager can be hard anybody know just doing life is hard and it feels like a weight that is on your shoulders but he he says it in his word if it's struggling hard come to me how many times have you gone to somebody else to ask them what to do you know we did that game the other day we go to everybody else everybody else fix my problems everybody else come in and everybody else fine lines up jacking up your life because one they never prayed about the purpose that God has over your life they've never seen notice or had some kind of direction of what God wants to do and so they're just they we say we're shooting from the hip what you think I should do you should go for it uh where did you get that from sound Council here 's a question that I was thinking about when it comes to God's Will and it comes to the place in which we are trying to get direction many people have you encamped around you that can hear the voice of God that you listen to more than when you only get in trouble who's around you hey real quick I was thinking about this thing real quick I wanted to get some context I want you to pray with me on it what do you think you know why it's so important for us to have the right people in our life because without the right people they would never let you give up your Birthright because you're exhausted you you some people are around you you need some people around you who we all about to do your dirt they exclude you because they see more in you than you see in yourself you know what we doing tonight bro we thought to get high you'd be like let's go they'd be like no you're not going why why I'm not going you you not out that claro that's that's not for you why isn't it for you why isn't this for me because I see something different in you and even though I can't get myself together I'm not gonna mess you up because I see something on the inside of you that I'm Not Gonna Let Die and then I'm not willing to compromise because I want to act a fool do you like some loyal people around you that will look at you and say I promise you you will not mess it up you are our ticket out of here no no no cause you don't understand some people are riding on you and they can't afford for you to mess it up you listen real quick you know man I'm about to I'm just out here I'm about to do whatever and they're like no no no no no no no no you need some people in your life that are going to say to you you have to stay together because if you don't stay together you're gonna mess up what I got going on you gotta have some people in your life will sacrifice for your call you're like that's too extreme pastor that's that's crazy nope that's having people around you who can see inside of you what you can't even see inside of yourself y'all gotta get some friends like that like let's go to the club don't invite them don't invite them don't invite them you know they're gonna get into scriptures you know they're gonna start you know they don't drink just don't invite them because somebody sees something covered over your life that they're trying to protect they don't want you to get exhausted before they get exhausted because who they're gonna call if you at the same level that they're at see some people know that you are their way out they know that once they call on you Deliverance can actually take place they know that when you pray things change they know that there's something special on the inside of you that can break some yolks and change the very minds of people they are waiting on you but if you become like everybody else and sell your Birthright just because you're tired and just because you're exhausted then who will they look to [Music] and then we learned as you saw s his Birthright because he's desperate anybody can we talk about this desperation we got out here and can you you ever find people that we listen you can get anybody can get desperate like real like I need this thing to work out anybody ever been there last moment we going we gonna hey we'll shut it off you better you better you better come on when you're exhausted and when you're desperate you compromise your purpose when you're exhausted and when you're desperate you compromise your purpose stop telling me how strong you are you are not that is the idea and thought process that you have an ability greater than what everybody else in the world has been able to do there's a desperation that you get to because you want to make it work anybody know about wanting to make it work for themselves like I want to make it work I'm gonna make it happen so I'm going to step in God's place and do God's work because I need to help God do what he needs to do because the situation is too close for me to allow him to do it by himself we're exhausted and we're desperate scripture says this Philippians chapter 4 verse 67 do not be anxious or worried about anything but in everything somebody say everything in every circumstance and situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving continue to make your specific request known to God and the peace of God that peace which reassures the heart that peace which transcends all understanding that peace which stands God over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus is yours tell your neighbor real quick stop being so desperate you out here taking every job you out here taking every relationship you you out here trying to get any man you can you you've been lonely for so long you don't even care no more you you just out here if they breathing I got them you know I'm just gonna be honest out here fellas y'all out here just taking anything and I'm just trying to tell you they don't even care about your destiny they don't even care about your purpose they will take everything you got they will take your anointing they will take everything that you can imagine and they will throw that thing to the floor and look at you and say well that's on you stop being so desperate you desperate you out here looking for anything to satisfy the need and the problem is it's desperation too early desperation for the wrong thing can have you in the place or most of the time you're right back to where you are because you can't restrain yourself because you're desperate and then last but not least we're exhausted we're desperate and we're distracted [Music] we're exhausted why are you exhausted let me tell you why plain answer not tired we're talking exhausted you're exhausted because most likely you're doing things that God never called you to do and What You Won't Do Is lay down the things that you were never called to do for the things you were called to do so you're tired and then you become desperate because it's not working out in the pace that you want it to work in well that becomes a part of the process because what God says is I'm not going to do more to get you further because you won't listen to where we are now and then we get to this last place of being somebody say distracted um distracted tempted unfocused no Direction lacking of missing the mark and then we give it back to God and says well what do you expect me to do how can I win this it's too much let me let me give you a scripture First Corinthians chapter 10. verse 13. it says there's no temptation regardless of its Source has overtaken or enticed you that is not common to Human experience nor is any Temptation unusual or Beyond human resistance but God is faithful to his word he is compassionate and trustworthy and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability to resist but along with the Temptation he has in the past and is now and will always provide the way out as well so that you will be able to endure it the Bible does not say you will escape every temptation but it says he will give you a way out that you will be able to endure it without yielding what does that mean that means without going over there and looking at that ice cream and taking him just one lick I just want I just I just want to look I just a little a little bit if no he says I'll give you the power to withstand you don't have to yield to it you don't have to taste you don't have to touch I'll give you the power to withstand it says to endure without yielding and will overcome Temptation with somebody say Joy that's it Joy well your smile in the face of the thing that was set as an early seed in your life to discourage you to take you off focus and to break your purpose he says there is no temptation that is not common what is he saying that thing is like everything else I'll give you the strength and the ability to overcome it and you will not have to stay where you are you will not have to yield you will not have to go over that thing again you can say I want to tell you no more today I'm interested are there a couple of Unleashed people who can understand that even in my exhaustion I won't give up my Birthright even in my desperation I won't give up my Birthright even in the distractions I won't give up my Birthright why because he has something greater for me hold the other side just nudge your neighbor and smile and say you can do this thing [Music] I don't think they listen I I don't I don't I don't think that was the person I'm gonna help you find somebody else look at somebody else real quick turn to your second choice and say second choice you can do this thing no no no no no no no no they didn't believe you nope you gotta find somebody else you got the you got to find somebody or you need a third choice I want you to look at that third choice and I need you to look them in the eye you can do this thing this thing shall not overcome you this thing shall not wear you out this thing shall not defeat you this thing shall be I shall be an overcomer I am greater in this circumstance anybody can hear me in 2023 I will not give over to this thing not another day not another moment not another area I won't go back I won't go back I won't go back to Stinger it's greater inside of me and his name is Jesus I'm not going back you won't take me back to that place I will not live in that sad place again I will not be controlled by my anxiety my depression the worries of this life I don't care if I'm exhausted I'll be able to endure it why because he who the sun sets free is truly free indeed I no longer control by my thinking and my ability what I give it over to Jesus God take control over everything [Music] let's tell your neighbor real quick don't give up your Birthright once you give it up don't you sacrifice what God has for you listen oh I I listen real quick I got to tell you this if I can't then I gotta get off and then I gotta go all right so I gotta tell you this the closest some of the closest people to you will not get this don't wait on them because they'll catch up foreign [Music] don't get angry you heard Pastor today you need to get it right don't sell your Birthright no no don't be antagonistic just say I just gonna catch up with me [Music] here's this last part I don't know why I did this huh God just gave it to me I wrote out this paper and uh it's double-sided and uh on one side it has Birthright on the other side it says the rejection of your Birthright can they put that up on the screen so that everyone can see it and then in the scripture in my Birthright it says real quick come to me all you who are struggling hard carrying heavy loads I'll give you rest and he says I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven and all who have left houses brothers sisters and father and mother and children or fawns because of my name will receive a hundred times more and then We'll Inherit internal life and he says that this peace I leave with you my perfect peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you don't let your heart be troubled nor Let It Be Afraid let my perfect peace calm you in every circumstance and give you courage and strip for every challenge but you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you he said now therefore there is no condemnation to them no guilty for no punishment for those who are win Christ Jesus who believe in him as personal Lord and Savior then he says but this is pricely what is written that God has prepared things for those who love them and know I is seen and no ear is heard and have not crossed the mind of any human being and then he says you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light and this promise that he has promised to us eternal life he says and for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command with the voice of an archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God and the Bible says and the dead in Christ will rise first Mama Grand Mama Teddy Uncle Pat dead in Christ will rise first then we who Allah who are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord and so will we always be with the Lord I just want to let you know there's a promise greater than a house greater than a god greater than what you can grant the Bible says he shall descend from heaven with the shout of the voice of the Archangel and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up you can take my house you can take every shoe you can take every piece of clothing you can take my car you can take my wife's car you can take my family's car why am I declaring it cause they're going too you can take everything we have because we're planning to be with him in the air that's what this is all about or you can find yourself on the other side and you can put your name and it's called the rejection of Birthright and says I whatever your name is hereby give out my Birthright for the pleasures of this world I have found myself to be exhausted desperate too exhausted desperate and distracted to receive my inheritance everything that God has for me climb [Music] I made a couple of these not just I just leave them right here [Music] but I signed one at my office [Music] and I got my Birthright and every promise that God gave to me I snatched it I said God everything that you have for me I wanted right now I want my I I don't care what the devil is trying to say I don't care what's trying to happen in the moment what I am declaring today is that everything that God has for me is already yes and amen you like Pastor why why would you only make 25. [Music] that makes no sense [Music] I said I'm not sure if anybody's hungry I don't know who wanted their Birthright and who didn't I'm not sure how urgent it was but I got mine's off the top sit right on my desk and here we go it wasn't because if you don't get a paper you don't have your Birthright I went to this church it did not mean my Birthright I'm not going back there again [Music] but the idea is that you got to be hungry and desperate for what God has for you you got to put that promise in God I want whatever it is you have for me and I'm declaring it not over just myself but I'm declaring it over my household and my family [Music] and so I saved one I'm gonna make sure my wife has it that's right [Music] I will make sure that my generation that my children that my grandchildren well understand the promises of God over their life can we celebrate God today for his word [Music] [Music] I was I was typing the paper I just just believe God was saying to me you got to fight for this thing foreign [Music] I can tell you right now the enemy is going through the aisles like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour seeking where he can take the seed that's been sown and when you get exhausted tomorrow you get desperate an enemy tries to distract you just remember I have a Birthright I've got an inheritance that God has for me
