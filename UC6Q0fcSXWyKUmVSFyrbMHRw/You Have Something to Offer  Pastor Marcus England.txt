to do is different than what you're just hoping happens i'm i'm believing today and expecting god lord if you woke me up this morning and you brought me into this space then that means you want to do

in the place because uh i'm excited for those of you that have uh just committed your hearts to the mix at the mix we believe that uh we are not consumers but we are contributors and so i've been grateful the last months that we have been seeing people that have been a part of this ministry through what we call growth track and growth track is our uh three step process of you going from a place of making yourself connected here at the mix partnering and membership to a place of serving and making a difference and that's our heart we don't believe that god commissioned us to be still we don't believe that god commissioned us to sit still we believe that god commissioned us as those who walk in dominion to be able to know that he placed a gift on the inside of us and through that gift we're going to make an impact in the world and so we are not just consumers we are contributors and we believe that what god is calling us to is a life that is full and abundant today and so we have growth track after this experience if you want to know more about what it is to be connected here at the mix check us out after our experience today i get to lead that session and so i would love to be able to share a little bit more with you about what god is doing here at the local church now i want you to open your bibles open your notepads get your phone out and get ready for the word of god we're in mark chapter six mark chapter six and here at the mix we say that note takers are what world changers so just remind somebody beside you tell them you're a world changer they may not know that and so they may not have their notes out i want them to get it out and say come on you a world changer and god's gonna speak something to you today in mark chapter six this is not in the series lessons even though it is i just changed it so you didn't get tired of me and uh we are going to jump into the word of god mark chapter 6 33 i'm reading starting at that verse and going to verse 42. it says now many saw them meaning jesus and his disciples going and recognized them and they ran on and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them and he being jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd and the bible says he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when it grew late it says his disciples came to him and said this is a desolate place and the hour is now late send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat but he answered them you give them something to eat i love jesus you share a concern he puts the responsibility back on you lord jesus these people are hungry you've been talking for a long time sir this message is long they need to go in and get something to eat jesus says you get them something to eat and they said to him shall we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat and he said to them how many loaves do you have go and see and when they found out they said five and two fish jesus enough to make five subs we have he says two just enough for five fish subs then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass and it says this so they sat down in groups by hundreds and fifties and taking the five they want to reiterate this mark wants you to get nothing has changed it's still five loaves and two fish it says he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people [Music] and he divided the two fish among them all and they all ate and were satisfied i want to come from the title today you have something to offer you have something to offer can you just tell somebody beside you real quick you have something to offer let's pray father in the name of jesus this moment we are recognizing that we are not without something to offer in this moment father i pray that our hearts would be receptive to hear what you are saying to us let the words that are spoken today only be your words and nothing more father i pray this morning that as we are receivers of the word hearers of the word that we will also be appliers of that word for we love honor and thank you in jesus name we say amen amen god bless you thank you so much musicians i always love this moment where i give this opportunity to be able to just say thank you to every volunteer and dream team member here at the mix can we celebrate all of our dream team members and volunteers come on y'all give it up for them this happens like this because of what they do [Applause] i want to speak on this topic you have something to offer and this is an important topic because oftentimes in life we find ourselves comparing anybody know about comparing comparing looking at what others have looking at what others are doing and looking because you find something of interest in the lives of others that oftentimes can seem like it's better than where you are in life today uh we will find ourselves online comparing we will find ourselves understanding that uh we are either admiring or comparing and sometimes we don't know the difference between the two we're admiring so much that now we begin to try to replicate our lives in the same essence of someone else it is okay to have someone be a a leader in your life it's okay for you to have a mentor it's okay for you to be able to find yourself at a place where you feel special about someone else's lives but what it's not okay is for you to become like anybody else i want to say this to you today unless somebody hasn't told you in your life you are unique you are unique in the way you are created the way you are built the way you are shaped your height the way that you look the way that you are think you are unique and god created you unique because there are unique problems in the world that only unique people can fix there's unique problems in the world that only you see a certain way you've ever walked past a place and and you started dreaming about what it could be when other people saw it as being broken and dilapidated you saw potential you saw a solution to what a problem and oftentimes in life i want to let you know that when you see a solution it means that god has given you an advantage point in who you are to see a correction in a problem that exists in the world that we live in today i want to let you know you're not here to mimic what someone else is doing you're here to address a specific problem in a specific area that god has called you to yes you may have the same degree yes you may be in the same department but i'm here today to let you know you are like no one else you are unique you are defined differently even the way they say your name they better put some respect on that thing i want to let you know today that you are qualified to be who you are and to think the way that you think because god has created you uniquely for the purposes of his kingdom now when i give you this assignment i want you to understand that the assignment has tried to be thwarted by the enemy so many times because john 10 and 10 lets us know that the thief the enemy comes to steal and kill and to what destroy his whole idea has been to take away the frame of who you are so that you could never apply a picture to who god says that you are becoming he wants to put you in the place where you don't believe that you have something great to offer unless it looks like the equivalent of someone you admire oftentimes we'll find ourselves in the place where we're waiting until we look like a mimic of something we like to call ourselves valuable you're finding yourself in the place where where where where where time has gone in and you may not see all of your dreams have come to pass and you're wondering what is your value today here's what i want to let you know that that the bible lets us know in genesis that you were created in the image and likeness of god what i want to let you know is you are not a waste of flesh you are not a waste of blood you are not a waste of air that has been breathed into your body you exist because god has a plan for your life you exist because there's something great on the inside of you that's not in anybody else i don't care who you're sitting next to they are amazing but they're not like you and i want you to define today that there's something special about who i am it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how young you are if you're still here god still has plans for your life don't you start quitting throwing in the towel thinking less of yourself you are believing that you are qualified according to what you have i want to burst the enemy's bubble right now i don't care if you're unemployed you still have a purpose and a plan i don't care if you've reached your financial goals yet you still have a purpose and a plan i don't care if you're single and ready to mingle you have what a purpose and a plan [Music] i'm here today to let you know that you're special you were special before you were even in your mother's womb at the creation god had already defined that you were special he had already called you the bible says before the beginnings of the earth you were already special i need you to get on the inside of me there is something unique about who i am my career doesn't define me my clothes don't define me my house doesn't define me what i drive doesn't define me i'm defined because what i made in the image and likeness of god i've got to put this as a preface because everybody won't speak that into your life so you must declare it and speak it over your own life you won't always have a group of people who are surrounding you that will give you the accolades that are needed you will not always be in the situation where you're going to have enough people to help you rise in the morning when you don't feel the self-worth that you want to feel but i just want to remind you that the very breath that's in your body comes from god and the fact that he's kept it in there means that there is an assignment for you to fulfill if i've got purpose then i'm priceless if i've got purpose then that means god still thinks i'm enough in this story if you look into the other gospels the feeding of the 5000 because there are certain pieces of information that are given throughout the four gospels of matthew mark luke and john that you will see different variations of is the number this one way and is this is this character in it this one way and as the disciples doing this in one way you'll see the variations of the gospel but when you read them all together you get the full context of the story and so the story if you look in your bible usually has a heading that says the feeding of the five thousand what we get from the other gospels is that we learn is that the five thousand is not men women and children the five thousand is defined as five thousand men why because in the eyes of society back in the day women and children weren't defined as being unique and specific and people to count so they only counted men the feeding of the 5 000 is like more of the feeding of the 10 to 15 000 that god had to be able to do in a moment because he understood there was a need in the crowd i'm here today to let you know that you have been created to meet a need in the crowd there's a need that is somewhere around you a need that is somewhere in your job a need that is somewhere in your friendships and your relationships and god has called you to meet the needs that's something to write in my notes god did not create me to just exist god did not create me just to be able to go from job to job and salary to salary and just find a boo god created me with purpose and he created my life to meet a need the question is if you don't feel like there's a need that you're meaning then there is a redefining of where you're going that you need to look to god for the purpose that he has established over your life you are here not by accident but you are here for a purpose somebody say purpose the bible lets us know that there are there are five thousand at least men and then you know women y'all always outdo us it's more than y'all then it always is of us and then you know the children they just go rampant and so there were families there there were couples there there were single folk there were old folk there there were there were young folk that said people from everywhere came running to jesus and the bible lets us know that as jesus is teaching he gets a little long-winded but he's so good that nobody is looking to go to brunch some of you are looking at your clock bass i have i've got a brunch appointment now you got to hurry this thing up now we're supposed to meet up and we're supposed to get brunch and you know brunch only has a time frame once you move past two three o'clock it ain't brunch no more it's just an afternoon snack that you eat now the bible lets us know that it gets late into the evening we're thinking around three o'clock according to bible commentary and and those are the theologians they they said it's around three and the disciples come to jesus jesus i probably need to wrap it up people need to get something to eat they're about to and another gospel says almost faint they're getting tired they're getting weak they're getting weary but they're staying connected because what they're learning and growing in is greater than the need that they have physically see there's a point of desperation that you get to in your life where the need spiritually becomes a little bit more pressing than the need physically you're like i can fast a little i can do without this but i need something that's going to carry me farther than a bag of chips could ever do i need something that's going to carry me farther than what a sandwich will ever do so i'm willing to put aside my physical needs for god to speak to my spiritual brokenness the bible says they stay around and and and they say we need something to eat jesus jesus says listen you go feed them disciples start looking at each other well that's impossible all this massive group of people how are we supposed to do it but there's always one in the crowd there's always one that's trying to meet and and figure out what jesus is saying it doesn't really give us a high description one scripture talks about philip but it speaks to the disciples and they start searching around to figure out where can we get some food now the bible in mark lets us know that jesus asked them how many loaves do you have now what we're missing is like you if you're looking at the bible and i'm reading the same way where did the loaves come from that's the picture here what where did the loaves come from jesus we're in a desolate place all of a sudden loaves appear is this the old testament is manna coming from heaven what is this that we are a part of bible lets us know it's not manna coming from heaven but there's a resource that's not talked about often times there's something somewhere tucked in a corner not feeling valuable not feeling having any sense of ownership and purpose but god sees right where the valuable folk god he sees where the folk are that feel broken that feel misplaced that feel like they have nothing to offer and jesus says where are the loaves and how many are there that means that there had to be a resource in the desolate place my question today is are you praying for what's already existing [Music] it's just that you don't have the spiritual eye to be able to notice that that's what god is doing the bible lets us know immediately that they go back and count and says there are five loaves and two fish now we did the baltimore way and we fried our fish i don't know what they did i don't know if it was steamed i don't know if it was smoked on the rocks i don't i don't know what it was but i know it was two fish i don't know if it was lake trout or tilapia i don't know if it was catfish but it was fish here's what i thought about i was looking at scripture and the last verse lets us know it says they all ate anybody ever thrown a a get together anybody ever been there before you throw a get-together you have people over you start connecting when you think about your guest list right you start thinking about people's allergies you ever been there before this one can't have soy this one is gluten free this one is nut free just come and drink some water because i don't know what you want me to do i don't even know how to make anything that is gluten-free i'm gonna have to buy this here's the point of contention jesus doesn't know and doesn't even seem to care at the moment about the 10 to 15 000 people and any allergies and any concerns that they have when god blesses something it doesn't matter if you're used to it if you can tolerate it if it's what you had before when he blesses it he says guess what my fish is different my blessings are different i know what happened last time but i'm trying to pull you into a mindset that whatever i give you is good enough for you why am i telling you that because there's some blessings around you that you've rejected because it didn't go well last time and you're thinking i'm allergic to it i can't handle it last time i did that it went down and you built a whole life against it and god is saying but you don't understand when i bless you with it it's more than enough when i bless you with it it's good when i bless you with it it'll go beyond what you could ever imagine or even think stop telling god i don't eat fish and take your blessing and run with it without anything you cook jesus that's the thing is that we become so choicey and our blessings that we find ourselves starving in a season where there is no famine and because you want it the way you want it how you want it i want mine's lightly fried anybody know when you go to the carryout you know about that and you order your food but you got seven ways in which it's got to be you go to my house it's like no what we want is fried hard double-sided no pickles i don't do pickles and that's how many of us are treating what god is doing in our life god's sake i want to bless you with that now see i need it to be at least 5 11. brown skin i like caramel though really good if you can give me a little light like light chocolate or if you can make it you know like that creamy white or if you like we got all this that we're telling god when you don't have nothing right now you're in a desolate place and we've gotten so picky with how we want god to bless us that we're not recognizing he's setting blessings right in front of us and some of us are demanding perfection from what we cannot give ourselves you know i don't do that the bible says there's two fish five loaves a broken part is is is the outside of the book of john the gospel no one else gives us an account of where this fish and loaves came from what i tend to look at is where where'd it come from i i understand the miracle the miracle is great but where'd it come from we didn't have five fish to begin with we didn't i mean two fish and we didn't have five loaves to begin with where'd it come from john digs in and says i just want to let y'all know i'm gonna be honest out of these disciples because the way we write now we're acting like we're the ones he says let me go and just burst the bubble there was a little boy we strong-armed his fish and his bread now i tend to think they had a real bony fish because five loaves of bread for two pieces of fish means they had to push down a lot of bones that's just that's sidebar that's my that's my version the marcus living bible the mlb doesn't seem like a good ratio does it here's the context that i want you to understand is that as john says there's a there's a there's a boy who had two fish and five loaves of bread it opens up to doors that the context is there may be things that god will use you to do that nobody will know about except for him alone and are you okay with meeting the need that god needs you to meet without the celebrity that goes with the need are you able to bless without letting somebody know you did the blessing are you able to give without making sure you call and say you got my large check right i just want to make sure you got are you able to offer without anybody mentioning your name the question that i'm asking is because i want you to know how important it is that god can trust you with what he has for you without you stealing his glory here's the thing what you will eventually find out is that you will receive the honor that god wants to place on you but it may not be never known in a book it may not never get on an instagram post it may not never find its way to a blog site it it may not never fit in the way you think it should fit but are you more concerned with god using you or people seeing that god used you i'm interested in that the bible says there's a boy there's there's somebody that's insignificant there's somebody that doesn't matter to the count there's somebody that is outside there's somebody that nobody would really look at it's somebody that doesn't have the financial currency i'm here talking to somebody today because you believe your worth and your value is in what you have in your account you believe your worth and value is in what you drive you believe your worth and value isn't what you see and where you live and i'm here today to let you know if you've got two fish and five loaves and don't nobody know about you you have something to offer god how about we give god a praise in here for having something to offer him ah yes [Applause] here's the first thing that i need you to know as you are seeing within yourself that you have something to offer what i want you to recognize is that you must recognize what you have the biggest problem often is that we don't even know what we possess so we cry and complain and pray for things that we actually already have the resources for god is never asking you to have everything to complete his work he's just asking you to be able to give what you have i don't know if you remember the story but jesus was watching the offering at the temple and there were so many that were giving out of their pockets and they were saying you know i have this and i'm giving out of my wealth and he said there was a widow there who had two mites nothing but two pennies and the bible says that when she gave jesus responded and said look at her she has given more than all of those who have given before her why was it the amount no it was out of the police that she gave it it was out of believing that what i have i have to offer unto god what i have is enough to give god what my best what i have to offer it doesn't matter what people think about it only thing that matters is what god says about it i'm here today to ask from you what do you have to offer god stop comparing it to other people stop making it put next to and when you're looking at other people's statements and bank accounts and cards and said lord i got this thing over here it's putt-putting and i don't know if it's going to make it up the street but i'll take somebody anywhere they need to go my question is what do you have lord we got a one bedroom apartment we we can't do a mixed group we can't help people find freedom we don't have enough space god said if you would just give space i'll give increase to the space [Music] but can you stop turning down god because you can't see it what do you have what what do you have in your purse what do you have in your pockets what do you have to be able to give just ask somebody beside you real quick do you know what you have because the truth of the matter is is you're probably complaining about what you have because it's not giving you the return of what you want but the problem is is that you haven't placed it in god's hands to multiply it so if i place it in god's hands so that he can multiply it i give him the ability to go and do greater in what he's doing than me relaxing and saying i don't have enough the first thing you have to know this is you have to know what you have i'ma tell somebody today you're praying for increase financially i'm gonna speak this to you right now god says i can't give you increase until you know what you actually have i won't give you increase until you can be a manager over your finances because you're right now trying to spin according to that in which you don't even know what you have can i be real with somebody real quick you got 10 subscriptions but you're talking about you don't have enough money you need to go through everything that comes out of you guess what that's going to take a lot of work pastor exactly it's going to require you to do something that puts you in the responsibility seat so that you can learn what it's like to have dominion over your own life and control where you're going so that you don't leave it up to miracles to make you lazy for what god has already provided for your life do you know how much you're supposed to have at the end of the year do you know what's supposed to be in your account at the end of paying the bills no i just let it come out god says well then i can't give you more because you don't even know what you have can i teach somebody real quick know what you have you know how many people how many places how many uh couples i've asked them what do you make what's the household income and people been looking at me like i don't know [Music] but then guess what happens finances become the biggest issue in the relationship here's why it's a brokenness because you can't speak intelligently to it because you don't know what you have because you're guessing because there's work in management so you keep praying for blessings so you don't have to manage what you have managing what you have would make you take a look at yourself if you looked at yourself you would see your spending more than you have in your bank account it would make you be accountable to what you're supposed to do and make cuts and since you don't like making sacrifices god says i'll keep it back from you and i can't multiply that in which you don't have an understanding of that's just a real quick moment for somebody who's praying for a breakthrough your breakthrough financially comes from you knowing what you have can i speak that to somebody today can i speak that over your life can i can i tell you the business that you're trying to open up is going to require you to do some research so that you understand so when the money does come in you know where it's going and god doesn't waste on you because the bible says at the end of this they scoop up all of the scraps and leftovers and they make 12 bags of it because it's going to be used for later god is not in the blessing business of giving it to people who waste because they don't know what they have it's not that your prayer doesn't work it's that your work doesn't work your work isn't working because your work isn't working you don't know how to apply it to where you should be going i want greater how are you going to get greater well i got i want a better house god wants to bless you i'ma declare it over your life how much you pay now what would the increase be how much do you need to save so you can get there i don't feel like thinking that out i just need a blessing that's how i go i just need a blessing here's the questions we say i just need to make more how much more [Music] this is how we pray y'all i just need infinite wait what you just want stuff just falling just everywhere no because then it makes me responsible for my blessing it makes me responsible for what i'm offering because here's the idea some of us don't need to pray because we already have it it's just broken in management [Music] so god is not denying the prayer to what you're asking for he's trying to get there to be a realization that he needs to be a better management to what you already have so the idea behind it is that god isn't failing on you and he's not ignoring your prayers he already answered it he needs you to connect with what he's already done do you know what you have what did he tell him go and see you need to write that in your notes what do i need to do you need to go and see i just be real like spiritual but real you're paying high car insurance because you don't feel like getting other estimates because it's going to take some i say work so you complain about your life because you won't do the work to get the work this is the opposite sometimes of what we've been taught because we say gotta do it anyhow no no no no god's not blessing you for your mismanagement that's not scripture that's not god so when you go to church all the time but you still look the same way you did five years ago because the spirit was supposed to come in and make the difference for the thing that you would not do of yourself god is saying what i'm calling you to do is have some sense and wisdom and to go and see what you have when you go and see then you know what to tell me and i can bless your prayer but you don't know what to pray for because you don't know what you have go and see how much what is it before gross what's it after what's the square footage what job are you going for what's the requirements then bring it to god god doesn't need to bless you with a miracle for information that's on google that's that over spiritual stuff that we go to because we want to be lazy in our salvation let's go to church jesus will bless you that's not how that works then you walk out of church next week upset this thing don't work no your budget don't work can i because because you have something to offer you just don't know what you have you haven't done anything to find out more about who you are and what you have to be able to give so that you know what you need to ask god for that is the impossible see i use god for the impossibles i do the possibles i like no that's not what they said when i got saved they said god would do exceeding and abundantly exceeding means further than you have the ability to do some of us have found ourselves in the place where we've just decided not to do so we're trying to pray it through god bring down my pressure stop eating the salty fish are we can we can we should we god send me a man god send me a woman get some healing from the broken relationships so that you can be healthy in the next one you got to actually know what you have i got bad communication skills guess what it's going to impact everything jesus come and fix it jesus is like no i need you to use what you have to get better of what you want to see the point number two that i want you to get because you're gonna be like how practical can we really get with this i'm not interested in you feeling good i'm not interested in actually you walking out your faith because if you can walk out your faith you'll actually see jesus works second thing be thankful for what you have in order to be thankful for what you have you have to have inventory of what you have how do you know what to be thankful for if you don't know what you have be thankful for what you have if it's a bike be thankful for it if it's enough money to get a scooter be thankful for if it's a car be thankful for it if it's put putting be thankful for the putt can i tell you some of our our issues is that we are never satisfied and content at the levels at where we are we have complained god got us from one level to the next we complained the whole way god got us from this level to the next one we complained the whole way god's like were you going to be thankful for what i've what giving you the bible says he offered it up and did what gave thanks i don't care if it's the job that you want it's the job that god is giving you right now so what you want to do is offer it up to god on monday morning and when you walk back in there and say carol you better not get on my nerves today i am offering this up to god right now william you will not talk my head off in this cubicle today i offer this up to god you got to give thanks instead of walking in i'm sick of this every monday [Music] i can't stand it every third i just can't i can't handle it you're walking in with the wrong attitude and disposition instead of giving thanks just thank god for it lord i'm in this marriage we've been in it for 30 years and guess what i'ma thank god for every component of it thank you jesus that i had to slap you silly can i tell you what god did somebody said give thanks and everything that you had the bible lets us know in first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 it says no matter what happens always somebody say always be thankful for this is god's will for you who belong to christ jesus you can be dissatisfied and still be thankful i don't know if anybody's ever taught you that you can still be dissatisfied and yet still be what grateful this is not where i want to end up but i'm thankful for what i have this is not the end of what i see but i'm thankful for where god is taking me i'm grateful for the place now but i'm not staying where i am being thankful doesn't mean you resign your vision being thankful doesn't mean you give up on what god spoke in your life it's recognizing that god has me at this point for a reason so i'll be thankful in the season and have a reason to give him thanks so that when the next season hits i can understand the lesson from the previous one well i was thankful man i thought you hated that job i didn't like it but i was grateful for it it got me through it walked me through some of us have so many complaints from our past because we haven't known how to be grateful for what it did for us you would not be here today without what you went through before i'm passing this bread out at the end of church this is going to be communion for next worship night so somebody say be thankful learn to be thankful learn to to walk in a sense of humility then i'm grateful sometimes i find that we can just look at what's wrong this is not the way i want it it's not where i want it it's not how i want it it's not when i want it okay it's coming but be grateful what i think we have gotten to in our world is this idea of complaining so much that we anybody get a survey after every call anybody ever had customer service tell you to rate them well yeah what if you didn't do well well i'ma rate you well i think that's hilarious hey listen before you get off this call can you rate me a five i'd be like no i told somebody that they said can you rate me a five i said no you didn't help me this makes no sense i'm dissatisfied i didn't say i was going to quit but i'm just satisfied with no i'm not giving you nothing i think the idea that i want you to come to is just because you have the ability to a voice where you feel doesn't mean your feeling needs to be your condition and sometimes we make our feelings the condition of how we live our days and you have to live beyond the condition of what you feel stop making your feeling the condition of your day i'm frustrated the whole day is frustrated you're walking in the office frustrated you eating lunch frustrated you walking in your home frustrated and everyone is feeling the effects of what you've made the decision because you're dissatisfied about something instead of saying i don't like it but it's not going to stay that way because i am thankful the last point i want to get to you is that you're called to use what you have whatever you have i want to let you know it's enough for where god has you to be whatever you have god can give you more he can bless you with more he can give you further but right now what you have is enough to get to the next season the bible lets us know that they said jesus took the bread at the given thanks it said he broke it [Music] sometimes before there's a blessing there's a breaking [Music] many times you're expecting it to go from bad to better to good to great and sometimes it goes from bad to worse to horrible but the god i serve can take it from horrible to amazing in one step if you can just trust him enough the bible lets us know be not weary in your well-doing for in due season you shall reap a harvest if you would faint not you got to use what you have until you have nothing to use use what you have whatever it looks like use what you have whatever it is use what you have here's the last part the bible says they broke it jesus broke the bread [Music] but before the little boy's lunch was used right the bible says jesus called order together [Music] it says he told him to sit in hundreds and fifties because what god has over your life he doesn't want to hand it out messy he wants to use it as a blessing to impact so many others but the best way to get it to others and the fastest way for your blessing to get and make an impact is that it can get to who it needs to get to and the problem is that at 10 to 15 000 people spread out everywhere they would have never been able to feed everyone because there would have been commotion everywhere trying to get in between people god knows what he's doing in your life the fact that you haven't seen the manifestation of what you've been giving and offering god does it mean that god doesn't have a blessing on its way what i want you to understand is that god is creating order where you can't see it and why he's blessing it and why he's moving in it and why you're getting the budget together and why you're correcting your finances he's setting things in hundreds and fifties uh and he's placing it to the side so that when he gets it back to be able to distribute it he got a pathway to get right to everybody that needs it here you go you want some god says i'm not gonna put you in confusion when i give you the okay to be the blessing you think that god is holding back and god is saying i'm preparing the way when i sit you in 50s and hundreds i'm creating pathways for you to get to every group of people that i got you to here's what i want to let you know you see the big picture and god's creating the pathway you're going from one person to the next person to the next job to the next job you're getting the next increase and the next increase and the next home and the next home and the next healing and the next healing and god says i'm doing what i'm making a pathway so that you can walk through it so that you don't stumble and fall everywhere you're going i'm multiplying everything that your hand touches [Music] he says i got to get it in order so that it can do what it's supposed to do we're ready to run with our gifts and blessings into a path of confusion and those who need to receive it will never receive it because the idea behind it is that we just want to see the manifestation of it we want to see the check the promotion the name behind it and we want to feel good and god says i don't work that way i'm not working for you you work for me so i'm creating pathways and lanes to get to the success of what i've called you to i'm here to speak to some young person don't you deny the process of what god is doing because he's setting you up for what you see don't get impatient let him make the pathway and you just give your gifts back to him [Music] if we didn't have any seats everybody would be just everywhere but because we have seats and sections it creates order for there to be entry and exit i can walk around and give a piece of this brent to everybody in this audience because we're in what order order helps us to reach faster and further so god is calling order together so that you can see that what he's calling you to is to bless the masses and the multitude not to just get it out to any and everybody [Music] i want to speak to somebody today who is who's given up on offering their gifts back to god during kobe there could be a huge part of us that we used to be contributors but we went back to being consumers and we stopped offering god what was doing to him and we've seen our pathways slow down because it got jumbled up again and there's no execution of where things need to go because you're no longer envisioning you're no longer praying about it you're no longer fasting about it you're no longer thinking about it it just seems like it's overwhelming i don't want to deal with overwhelming i want to balance life so i'll just let whatever happen happen and god says no i called your life to be intentional take your gift and give it back to god i'ma tell somebody today the greatest gift that you can offer is yourself romans 12 and 1 says therefore brothers and sisters i urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god for this is your reasonable this is your act this is the least that you could do unto god today i am telling you stop holding back i know we have our passion offering coming next sunday and some of you are like pastor i don't have anything to sacrifice i'm here today to let you know you got a might you got something to give to god don't you be ashamed you're like why what is this about how much money do you need it's not about how much money we need it's about you learning to trust god in a way you've never trusted him before [Music] i dare you be bold and come in and say i ain't got nothing but the pennies i saved up bring that penny back in here and drop and be like let's see what you do god i don't care what it looks like i don't care if i have a check to write i don't care if i have a big mouth why because i'm using everything that i have and i'm giving it over to god and what the bible says and when he broke it it kept what multiplying and multiplying and multiplying it's like the woman who had the vases of oil she just had all to keep coming as much as you've got something to give god to put something in he's got the ability to get it back out [Music] some of you god is just saying empty your pennies so i can put more back in and you keep on emptying them all right i'm gonna give you some more it's like keep on doing it and keep on doing you start saying god where's this increase coming from i'm multiplying because you were willing to trust me with what you have my question today is what are you willing to trust god with you may not ever hear your name called you may not never be counted amongst them who who seem great but here's what i'm saying today you didn't come to this earth for you you came to this earth to fulfill the will and purpose and plan that god has for you you have something to offer let's celebrate god in this place today hallelujah hallelujah [Music] i'm grateful for all that god is doing let's pray father in the name of jesus we thank you many of us are saying today god what do we have to offer it doesn't look like it it's not and i don't know what to do i don't know how to offer this i'm so used to the way that i do it god today i pray that there will be a spirit of release in this place that we can release what you gave to us and what you own back to you help us to release our children give them back to you our marriages give them back to you our purity give it back to you our sobriety give it back to you whatever it is that we took back control over our finances i pray we give it back to you our careers where we give him back to you to do whatever it is that you want to do with us we honor you today help us to take your word and to understand we have something to offer in your name we pray today amen
