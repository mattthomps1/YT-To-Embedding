[Music] we're starting a new series called the truth about jesus the truth about jesus today and we're going to talk in that we're going to have an opportunity just to really see what the lord is saying to us in the house and i'm so excited if you can get out your your bibles and your pens and your paths uh hear the mix we say that note-takers are what and readers are what come on readers our leaders and as we read the word of god god is leading us to change and newness of life and i'm believing today that we're going to see a victory in jesus name the bible starts in verse 17 of mark chapter 10 and it says this and as he was setting out on his journey meaning jesus it says a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him he said this good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said to him why do you call me good no one else is good except god alone he starts to run down because we always like the diys of life how do we do what do we do what's the ways to do and so jesus says listen you know the commandments do not murder do not commit adultery and do not steal and do not bear false witness and do not defraud and he says and honor your father and mother and he said to him teach her all these i have kept from my youth i'm pretty good i've kept this all in my life i i haven't strayed away i'm a i'm i'm pretty much a church kid i know what i'm doing i don't go too much out the realm and and so i'm pretty sure that i meet all of the requirements for eternal life the bible says jesus says to him looking at him he loved them and said to him you lack one thing he says go sell all that you have and give to the poor jesus you must be tripping tell me sell all i have you know how hard i worked everything it took to inherit do you understand how many classes i sat in how many how many how many years it took me to get this degree do you understand the work that i have done to get where i am he said but you lack even though you have you lack even though you're driving in it and you put it on your vision board and you set it up you still lack even even though you're not sleeping around and even though that you you've got your life together you still lack sell all you have give to the poor and i got something for you and you will have treasures in heaven i don't i don't want no treasures i mean i do want treasures and have but i want i want treasures now y'all got to be honest y'all if you if you're anything like me you i mean it's yes when i see jesus amen but i would like some of my treasures now if you're going to be honest i want my treasure now if i'm going to go sell all that i have i'm going to give everything up i need an assurance that what i'm giving up i'm getting back you say you have treasures in heaven he says give it up [Music] then come follow me i'ma let you know if i give it up i'm going to have a bad attitude when i follow you can can we be honest ain't going to be that happy you're not going to have a happy disciple you don't told me to give it all up i'm empty i'm broken i don't have the things that i believe that matter he's saying but if if you give it up and follow me you'll gain something greater the bible says in verse 22 disheartened by the saying says he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions but not necessarily a great life if he had everything he needed then when he walked away he wouldn't have been disheartened because the idea is that if i have everything on this earth that i need i'll be happy but the bible says he walked away disheartened because what had possessed his heart he wasn't able to let go of i wanted to talk as an intro message in two hour 72 week series y'all know how i can do i want to talk from the topic god is good god is good can we can we can we pray and then i'll address all of you [Applause] that just addressed me father in the name of jesus we thank you for this moment we understand that you are good all the time and so we pray that in your goodness we would understand all that you want to say to us in this moment for we love honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen hey man thank you so much musicians listen i'm so grateful for the people that helped put this together every week because we are portable can y'all help me give it up for our dream team y'all come on help me celebrate them i heard a couple of you comment back once i said god is good you responded all the time and i'm not going to continue that because it's going to force you if i say all the time you see how it came out you see you see you did you couldn't even stop yourself you were in a mode it forced its way out of you and here's what i want to talk about today is that god is good but good is relevant good is relevant according to the person whom eyes were calling it to be good last sunday after we left service i went home and and put on my cookout gear i went into the back yard and i i i i put the put the food on the grill the food that i started cooking i had it had it all laid out y'all i had some some ribs and i had a a nice piece piece of salmon not salmon but salmon laid out it was all it was all seasoned up all well and then my father came over he had just caught some catfish and and and so i had some catfish some salmon some ribs and i put it on the grill and can i tell you it was good it was good it was so good the people came out licking their fingers pastor just trying to tell you i said there's an easter anointing all over this food i'm trying to tell you charles the ribs were so tender and and and they were they weren't falling off the bone because if they fallen off the bone that's not a real rib you don't know ribs it's got to stay on the bone so you can actually eat it with the bone as if you really know about it and and then when i got through with that i put the salmon on the salmon had had all the buttery goodness in it because it you know you just had to add a little bit a spring when i pulled it out it was laying right there people couldn't help but start cutting and eating i said we're not through yet oh glory i put a piece of catfish on the altar before the lord i sacrificed it and i cooked that thing and all i know it was good the problem is is that my wife doesn't eat ribs i said you don't know what you're missing she said to me i'm not missing nothing because i don't eat it the problem with this was is that according to me my taste my like the way i like my ribs the way i like to see them done i'm trying to tell you if you asked my opinion it was good to me anybody ever been on a thanksgiving cookout you you go over a family of friends and and they're telling you oh this food is going to be good anybody ever assure you that oh my mama can cook my my auntie can cook she can really lay in and and when you get there there is a misuse of information adjectives and contexts to describe what it is you're putting on your plate macaroni and cheese is light-skinned it's not orange or yellow what kind of cheese are you using it's jesus don't mess with it just use velveeta so we can get as much out of it can i tell you that we all have an opinion of what we call good good is according to the household i grew up in good is according to the way my mama used to cook good is according to the way that i used to eat my thanksgiving good can be very relevant to the person who thinks it's good on sundays i see each of you as you're leaving out love my church some of you will tell me pastor that message says we're good you've been preaching james others of you just give me a pound and say keep working on it can i tell you that your version of good may be different than my version of good some of you say i have i have some really good parents can i can can i tell you your version of good is different than my version of good and here's the problem because all of our versions of good is different good is defined differently to every individual can we get real serious do i got any single people in here don't raise your hand can i just hear you out there that's it you're single admit it that's where you're at truth will set you free but every single person is looking for somebody and can i tell you ladies you're saying i'm looking for a good man fellas i just need a good woman and every time that you give the word good you give the supporting facts behind what good looks like to you i just need a good man a good man yeah yeah i need a good man what's a good man well i just need him to you know just love me the way i am and support me and we go into a description of what good means to us the problem is is that good means different to what i have to compare it to in our scripture text today the bible says that there's a rich young ruler the gospels let us know between all of their connecting points is that he is this young ruler and he is exemplary i'm trying to tell you he is the very definition of what you want to be able to connect with as a good person the bible says he's rich he's young he has leadership which means he's disciplined himself enough to be put into position to carry authority in him carrying authority he's been trusted and not only is he trusted but the bible says that he's eager to know about eternal life can i tell you that that looks like a good person y'all that looks like somebody that you want to get to know it looks like an individual that best suits the need if you saw him running up you said pastor now that's a good saying that's a good person that's in the church that's a good somebody the bible says he comes up he runs to jesus on his knees and he says good master how can i hurt eternal life the problem is is that jesus has to break up this moment with him because he is so into the moment of knowing about eternal life that he doesn't recognize that god is on the scene can i tell you today you don't have to ask god for eternal life it's a part of the package the bible lets us know in john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever chooses to believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life eternal life is the part of the package of accepting who god is the problem is is that there was this separation between jesus and god the bible tells us very knowingly that in this moment he makes this delineation that jesus is the good master good master means he's a good rabbi he's the good teacher it means he's good according to the opinion of the rich young ruler how many of you have called somebody good and then saw them and had to pull your good back [Music] you ever been there before you gave them all the accolades you thought they were great until they went overboard oh that was a good person until they cussed you out [Music] that was a good person until they started talking about you that's a good individual until they put their lips on your name keep your name out my mouth don't talk my name out your mouth what happens the version of good changes because of the definition that we have of good and good is often connected to the emotional context of where we are now so the good isn't responsive to the total characteristic of who an individual is good is according to the context of where we are in relation with people and where they are in their life so good is subjective good is subjective to what we believe it is so we got to be careful with saying somebody's good because that subjective good can change according to the set of circumstances or places where we find people to be good good jesus is good that's what he lets us know jesus is good here is where i think we may fall off sometimes is that jesus is good when things are good and the idea that jesus is good when things are good equates my definition to how i think his actions fare with my opinions if jesus is good then it's according to the set of circumstances that i'm in jesus is good when things go my way jesus is good when i have a good doctor's report jesus is good when things fare out the way i want them to jesus is good when i receive an extra check in the mail that i didn't know i was going to receive jesus is good when i get a large fry instead of a medium jesus is good jesus is good when things are better than they were but the question is is jesus still good when things that i prayed for have not come to pass or actually have gotten worse than what they originally were is jesus still good when things are pushed back further than i set up in the plans of what i constructed for my life when my five year goal turns into a seven year and a seven year turns into a ten year is he still good that's the question that we're facing today because if not he is a good master but not a good god he's a good teacher he's a good ethical person there's good morals that the bible has there's good good things that the bible says the problem is is i can't separate jesus from the word because john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god but genesis lets me know out of the mouth of god he spoke into creation what is the word jesus is the word and if jesus is the word that means the word cannot be false and if the word cannot be false then it cannot just be morally and ethically sound it must be truth beyond our understanding so the clarity in god being good according to the set of circumstances that we walk and live out of means that god is good according to the conditional state of where you are god is good if my mama's healthy god is good as loud as things are working out for my good here's what i want to give you the truth about today is that god is good jesus is good the holy spirit is good all ways for what you can explain and what you cannot explain for what you see and for what you do not see god is good the thing that we've got to get and understand is that the young rich ruler tried to separate and delineate between god being good and god being master and lord and god just being a teacher and the problem is is that you will put him in the category you want him to be in for as much as you want him to be a part of your life but if he is god he is god always he's always god which means he's always good he's always god which means he's always good which means that it cannot be subjective to how i feel you don't know what happened to me i don't but it doesn't change who god is god's divinity is not hanging on the balance of my opinion of the current state of situations and circumstances that i'm living out in my life god is not good according to the number of bedrooms that i'm able to get through what god is able to bless me with god is not good according to what he can give me in the vehicles that i'm driving and that i can buy god is not good when he gives me a child or i don't have a child god is just good so let's take the subjective opinion off of god being good and let's state the fact that god is good and all the time whether it goes my way or not i've come to understand he's god and his divinity goes so further than what i feel that i begin to recognize that god is greater than church god is greater than religion god is greater than any feeling or messed up idea that i have god is god and in his divinity and presence is peace joy and the holy ghost so what i want to speak to you today is the clarity and understanding that we no longer serve god for what he can do we no longer serve god for what we can understand we no longer serve god for what we can rationalize we serve him because he's god set aside your opinion your history your clarity of history wars previous wars pass wars future slavery no slavery injustice no injustice racism no racism it doesn't matter to who he is he is god can i give you an understanding that there are some things you will not understand but it does not hinge on the factor of who god is while we go there let's get an understanding of what god is looking for as he sent jesus his son to be the covering of our sin one thing that the rich young ruler wanted was eternal life he wanted something from god but the clarity is in order to have from god you have to be able to offer god something salvation is offering him your heart your belief in who he is there is something that is in exchange now there is not equality in the exchange for what you offer god is no comparison to what god can offer you so let's not get it twisted that whatever it is you believe that you are sacrificing it's not equivalent to what god has to be able to offer you they don't measure up the same there is no offering that you can give that gives you the clarity that you and god are on the same level of giving and receiving bible says he gave his life so that you could live today so the clarity that we got to get from this is there is not any equivalency from god to us and us to god but god immediately has given us everything already what we're doing is being a part of the journey in progress of now being able to receive everything that god has already established for our lives god is not establishing your blessings god has already created your blessings what he is waiting for is for you to step in the proper season to receive what he has for you because a season of the wrong blessings can tear your life apart and put you in position to backtrack from being everything that god has called for you to be if you get it in the wrong season it'll mess you up it'll jack you up and it'll put you in a place where you're trying to hold on to something that you have not been equipped or built to be able to handle but everything that god has for you is already taking place he's not making it he's not creating it you're just asking him to manifest it let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven which means in heaven god starts at the end and then goes to the beginning he's really good at knowing and defining what you're already going to do before you even get there to do it what he's trying to do is take you along the journey to believe that by faith he can do anything the bible says exceeding and abundantly above all that you can ask or think but what he has to do is grow your faith to believe enough that what he says is yes and amen so the first point that you must get is that why you may think the church is after your money why you may think people are after your time why you think they just want to consume you all the time jesus says all i'm after is your heart i'm just after your heart that i'm after the very thing that that that it consumes you i'm i'm after the very thing that is controlling and moving and directing you because whatever lays on your heart is the very thing that lays on who you are and if you can't understand that god's after your heart then you always think he's after something else god's after your heart just tell your neighbor real quick god's after your heart let me let me tell you you you don't make enough for god to be after your money i i know you think a little bit about yourself but you don't make enough you you're 40 000. you're 60 000 your 100 000 can't accomplish the work that god needs for it to accomplish so i want to let you know whatever it is that you think he is grabbing after and whatever it is that you're like i'm not going to do that because you know what i can't do all that and give it all up god says i'm not after what your possessions are i'm after your heart and the problem is is that our possessions have our heart that's why he is after your possessions you missed it you missed it you you got to get it because if not you're focused on the wrong thing that you think god is after and when god is tugging at your heart about generosity he's not tugging at your money he's tugging at your heart because your money has your heart the church won all my money what are we going to do nothing praise jesus no god says what i'm after is your heart because if i can release you from your money you could actually follow me see there's a barrier oftentimes between us and god that we don't see as being the possession point of what keeps us out of his will and because we're so possessive on the things that we have that we work for and that we want we're not available for god to speak do whatever it is that he wants to do because we are so focused on god being our genie you know god i need you to work it out this way you know you know i need you to do it this way you know i need you to work it in my stead i need you to fix it for me and god says here's the problem is that i want to fix it for you that way but that's not the way that i need for you to go because the way that i'm calling for you to go is the way that's going to make you and the way that's going to make you will make you to the person that you love but the problem is you keep making yourself into the person you can tolerate some of us are living with a tolerated us instead of a purpose filled us you will like you more if jesus got a hold of you and so will we amen praise the lord praise the lord we will like you too because the complexity is that god is trying to form you and build you until he's really called for you to be but there are some things that have constructed themselves that are possessions of your heart and it's not only money but is the anger that you possess it is the pride that you possess it is the areas of your life that you possess that you are so constructed to believe that it is the fruit of who you are but the problem is the fruit of who you are is not bearing much and god is saying i have so much more for you if you can lay yourself down paul says i i urge you i ask you i plead with you brothers i really i really urge you i'm pushing you he says i want you to present because i can't force it from you you got to present your bodies as a living sacrifice you gotta you gotta uh here i go lord let me let me present it to you god said because i'm not willing to snatch from you something that you're not willing to give jesus is after whatever has your heart the question today that you want to write down is what has my heart some of us are consumed with our own recovery it has your heart some of us are consumed with finances some of us are consumed with our boo some of us are consumed with unhealthy relationships some of us are consumed with our past brokenness that it enters our life every day some of us are consumed with fear and we will never live out what god wants us to if we don't break away from it but i want to let you know today if he can get your heart he can change your life not if he can get your wallet if he can get your heart he can change your life if he can get you all the you you would be oh the kind of person that you would be oh the individual that you would not be i'm just trying to tell you you would leave anger to the side and you just walk up to your enemies just like let me hug you today man you better stay away from me what's wrong with you i got the love of jesus he got my heart now i'm not so angry anymore he's got my heart i'm not so inconsistent anymore he's got my heart i'm not so flaky anymore he's got my hearts the question today is does god have your heart and if god doesn't have your heart what has your heart scripture says in first samuel chapter 16 verse 7 but the lord said to samuel don't judge by a man's face or height ladies talking to y'all a relationship series right now because he was going through trying to figure out which one was the one he says for this is not the one for for the one that you looked upon that you thought had it all together the one you called good isn't the one he said i don't make decisions the way you do men judged by outward appearance how you look the way you carry yourself and judging by what you put on what your sneaks like don't worry about what my sneaks look like it says but i look at a man's two things thoughts and intentions thoughts and intentions some of us mess up but our intentions are good you're trying to wonder why god's blessing you when you messed up did you catch it you're trying to figure out why she keep getting blessed because god wasn't interested in her actions he was interested in her thoughts and thoughts and intentions have something to do with the why would god use you to do what he's called for you because he was looking at my thoughts and my intentions [Applause] see that ought to free somebody from the spirit of perfection because all you got to do is work on them thoughts and those intentions and if my intentions are to please god even though i woke up late i might still get the job that's why they'll tell you favor ain't fair y'all why did they get that why would god bless them why would god move them up why would god give them position because the intentions and thoughts were of god [Music] i'm going to tell you something today the rich young ruler came looking good a leader young wealthy had it all together not making any mess-ups credit score 8.92 above what you can even make bank account amazing saving like crazy frugal you should have it all together why would god why god bless you well god why would god use you why why would god use you don't tell me your savings account but you ain't saved you might as well close it because you can't save nothing in a long time but the question becomes why would god still bless you because he saw my thoughts and intentions i love when some people look at our lives and they'd be like how did y'all get to wear your thoughts and intentions because i jacked all that up anyway anybody have made some mistakes sometime and people still looking at you trying to figure out why god bless you i i don't know i just kept trying and i thought i was going to help somebody and he kept blessing me and i didn't know that's how i work because i thought i had to be perfect and i'm breaking that spirit of perfection over you because god's concerned about what's on the inside of you just tell your neighbor real quick you ain't got to be perfect you got to be perfect but you need godly thoughts and intentions and you can't have godly thoughts and intentions without spiritual renewal when you're not praying when you're not seeking god when you're not in your word guess what your thoughts and intentions are of this world but the bible says when you're seeking at them he said if you seek me you'll find me and sometimes i'm just lucky enough to find him and he's lucky enough to see my thoughts and intentions and say you know what in spite of her i'll still bless you anybody ever had a inspired blessing before you didn't deserve it you didn't do anything to gain it you're not perfect you messed it up matt but the lord still did it [Applause] anybody ever had a butt god bless him before [Music] he did it anyhow i'm still trying to figure it out [Applause] people talking about well how'd you get that i don't know did y'all save no well how did you get it i don't know the thing is my thoughts and my intentions have been constantly on him i've been i've been constantly thinking about faith and expanding my faith in and i'm not living in fear every moment of my because he told joshua do not fear but be courageous for the lord thy god is with thee i messed it up but he saw my thoughts and intentions and i'm grateful point number two jesus will never withhold truth because of feelings the bible says he loved them my god he loved him saw this young man everything perfect example living specimen forbes topless gq mike this man was on the magazine philanthropist missions work all over the world problem is jesus didn't care about the outside he cared about what was happening on the inside sometimes you don't look like where you are because you're doing more work inwardly than you're doing outwardly well what you doing today i'm not spending my money on no clothes why because i'm spending my money on something else that's going to get me further to where i'm going i'm working on something inwardly that will produce and multiply outwardly don't judge me by what you see because he's doing a work on me can i tell you today the bible lets us know that truth will set us free some of us the only reason we're bound is because we just don't like truth and truth is inconvenient anybody walked up to anybody this week and be like give me truth now let's go somebody started saying you you really want to go down that road cause i got some things i'd like to share about you [Music] here's the thing if you're not digesting truth you're not going to look to receive it if truth isn't a part of your appetite then where will you be my staff knows they get a dose of truth every week they don't ask for it they're not looking for it they don't want it some of them have tried to block me but truth is the only thing that grows you and if you're not in relationship with people who give you truth then you're in relationship with people that will pacify you i'm gonna hear you out it just don't mean i agree because truth sets you we know it so won't we get it won't you get in a community of people that like you for more than what you look like and what you make your house is nice but i'm not that impressed i'm impressed by you not what you possess jesus loved him but his possessions he didn't care about he wanted his heart so jesus is going to give you that truth even if them feelings get hurt scripture lets us know in jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 through 10 it says this the heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful a puzzle that no one can figure out but i god search the heart and examine the mind i get to the heart of the human i get to the root of things i treat them as they really are not as they pretend to be some of us been pretending for a long time god says i want to free you from pretending you can be you but in being i love this you want all of me i heard people say that before you want all of me i'm like i want go ahead give me all of you but giving me all of you doesn't mean that it deletes the truth that has to come to you your brokenness is keeping you where you are regardless of your anger that you possess that's breaking your heart and guarding your heart regardless of the way that you think that you have made an idol out of because we love to idolize our own thinking regardless of it jesus says the truth if you get it it'll set you free so the clarity is if you're not free you're missing some truth brittany we'd be missing truth you know like we don't like that truth because that truth get all up in us and to make it you know we start doing stuff you start crying you start start falling snotting up a little bit start getting angry emotions start coming out you know what i mean and stuff people gotta start telling you and it's like do you want freedom no just ask your neighbor do you really want freedom you really want freedom not your perception of freedom do you really want freedom because truth can set you free and sometimes you got to get away from people that's just like you because they're going to give you the same truth because just like the man at the pool of bethesda i don't want to shake and rock the boat because everybody around me is the same like me and when we get together we do and say the same things all of us complain we just all complain how you feeling today ah i'm here you're here that's all you got for god today is you're here watch where you are because jesus wants to impact your feelings last point point number three jesus knows whatever he has for you is greater than what he asks of you whatever you think you're sacrificing i want to let you know today it compares nothing to what god has for you the bible says he can do exceeding abundantly above all that you could ask or think according to the power that's at work within us mark 10 further down in the scriptures peter is talking and connecting in the moment it says he has these words because jesus gives a truth that's hard he says it's easier for camel to get through the eye of a needle it says than it is for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of heaven it's like peter said what kind of analogy is that jesus then who can he goes in and says with man it's impossible he said but with god all things are possible peter goes on to say lord we've given up everything for you brother mother sister father because the funniest thing is that jesus doesn't just require all of you he requires everything that you have and this is what jesus said he said mark my words no one who has sacrificed house brothers sisters mother father children land whatever because of me and the message will lose out he said they'll get it all back but look at this promise right here he says but multiplied many times if you don't highlight nothing else in your scriptures in your bible you've got to go back and highlight the it does what he said it says multiplied many times homes brothers sisters mothers children and lamb but he says like peter knew it was a pleasure to be beaten for christ it was a luxury it was a telling of how great god is to them i i would die for him it is an honor to die he says so understand with it comes troubles sometimes you're complaining about troubles but you don't understand is that the troubles are a result of your reward because you finally made a stand for god in the way that was going to cost you when i say some stuff online there's some people in that comment section about as much crucifixion as we're gonna get around here i don't agree i don't like it what kind of jesus do you serve it says yo there'll be some troubles and then he says on top of all of your blessings here he said and then there's a bonus of eternal life this is once again the great reversal i want to tell you many who are first will end up last and the last will become first don't you worry about trying to get ahead of everybody else jesus already has your direction in your pathway you're not behind you're not behind stop letting the enemy speak that you're not behind stop trying to keep up with everybody else you don't need to catch up with anybody else god can catch you up you're at the right place as long as your thoughts and your intentions are about him you know man i'm i'm reaching that age where you know i'm gonna hang it up god says i'm not here to tell you when to hang it up i'm here to let you know today if you follow my word whatever you sacrifice for you i'll multiply somebody say multiply god god whatever i give today multiply it whatever i sacrifice today multiply it what he's saying is i'm trying to work out your faith so that you can believe that whatever it is that you're giving up i can do more than you could ever imagine or think i'll multiply pastor why do you give cause i'm he multiplies it it's his anyway ain't it crazy that god gives to you and then
