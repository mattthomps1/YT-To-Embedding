[Music] thank you we're going to crack open the word of God to First Chronicles chapter 28. First Chronicles chapter 28 and we're going to read verses 1 through 12. so you're going to get your daily devotion this morning don't worry about it I gotcha we're going to jump into God's word I think there's a word that he has for you and me and this word is for us to understand that God is not speaking only for what's now God is speaking for what's next First Chronicles chapter 28 and this is a a a a favorite of mine when we're talking scriptures because um David is one of my favorite individuals that has been recorded in the Bible and David the Bible says is one whom is a king and he is the king over Israel and and he is the Bible says a man after God's Own Heart and I believe that that's all of our desires or it should be that all of us have a desire to have a heart for God and to be someone after the Lord's heart I welcome you those of you that are online my name is Marcus England we were just having a good time so I forgot to tell you my name uh it's Marcus England we're the leap I'm the lead Pastor here and I'm grateful that you're here with us and I just think we have this opportunity to jump into God's word starting at verse one the Bible says David summoned all the officials of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem the officers of the tribes the commanders of the divisions and the service of the king the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and the officials in charge of all of the property and livestock belonging to the King and his sons together with the palace officials the Warriors in all the brave fighting men it says King David Rose to his feet and said listen to me my fellow Israelites he says my people he said that I had in my heart anybody ever had a desire in your heart anyone ever had a dream in your heart anyone ever been at a place where you said God you've placed something in my heart and I want to fulfill the dream that you've called me too David said I had in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for the footstool of our god what does that mean Pastor it means that God cannot be contained to a building so David said at least if it can be the footstool of the Lord it says and I made plans to build but God said to me you are not to build a house for my name because you are a warrior and have shed blood yet the Lord the god of Israel chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever I want to let you know the day that God has chosen you he has chosen you to be a part of a legacy and a plan that he's called you to he said he chose Judah as a leader and from the tribe of Judah he chose my family and from my father's Sons he was pleased to make me King over all Israel he said of All My Sons and the Lord has given me many he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel and he said the Lord he said to me now here's is important a part of what we're talking about today the question is what has the Lord said to you not what have you just conjured up in your thoughts not what has your best friend your boyfriend your girlfriend not what has just your family member or your good friend but what has the Lord said to you when's the last time you've heard the voice of the Lord it says he said to me Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my Courts for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father I will establish if you have a physical Bible that's a great place to underline he said I will establish Pastor why is that important because there is some of us who do not have a past that has been established for us so God is calling you to establish I want you to get that because some of you are discrediting the reasons why you cannot be the one in whom God has chosen to go further and the issue is is because you keep looking at your past as being the reason that you cannot move forward in your future but I'm here today to let you know is that if you did not come from it you're called to establish it you don't have to keep complaining about who was not there you don't have to keep establishing who left you you don't have to keep living in the premise of the things that got disconnected you do not have to keep remembering the ways in which it did not work out what I want to let you know if it had not been established for you you are called to establish it tell your neighbor real quick he's looking for you he said I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unwavering and carrying out my commands and laws as is being done at this time he said David and I'm speaking this to elders and and those in whom are older that he said I I now charge you he said in the sight of all Israel and the Assembly of the Lord and in the hearing of God be careful to follow not be careful to leave be careful to follow because we oftentimes have more of a desire to tell God where we're going than to ask God where we're going said be careful to follow all the commands of the Lord your God and that you may possess this good land and pass it on as in inheritance to your descendants forever and you my son Solomon he said acknowledge the god of your father and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind he says this for the Lord searches every heart what does that mean you can look good on the outside but he's looking at somebody say he's looking at my heart it says the Lord searches every heart and he understands every desire and every thought the Bible says if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake Him he will reject you he said forever he said consider now the Lord has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary I want to highlight this to somebody that's in a lazy season you ever been there before you in a lazy season ever you ever been there before you were pumped up now you just like whatever so whatever season of your life you got comfortable the bank account don't look bad you're feeling good you've enriched your goals you're going into the new year like I don't have that many resolutions because I've achieved so much this is what he told them he said be strong and do the work be strong and do the work he said then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the Portico of the temple its buildings its store rooms its upper Parts it's inner rooms and the place of atonement I want you to catch that because some of you are waiting for others to give you a plan that God has already planned for you and I want to speak to you today that it's time for you to get your own plan tell your neighbor real quick do you have a plan verse 12 last verse he says he gave him the plans of all that the spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the Temple of the Lord and all the surrounding rooms for the Treasures of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things I want to come from the topic today create it for next create it for next we're going to pray and jump into the word of God father we thank you today that we were created for next in Jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians so grateful for so many that have made today possible can y'all help me celebrate your dream team my dream team the amazing people that make it happen every week thank you I think it's interesting that we've got to understand this term up next because many times we can live from now and now it's the place where oftentimes our desires arise because we're always thinking of the context of now what will I do now how will I act now what do I want now where are the things in my life somebody say now and now there's oftentimes the premise where we make decisions not understanding that now impacts next if I understood now if I understood how important this decisions of today would be for what I see tomorrow I would recognize how important my now is I understand that later on in life that how much we do today impacts the Legacy and impacts the life that we see to come much of what I've learned has come from my own family myself my my my family is an established family and Ministry and we've been doing Ministry early in our lives I know it to be that my grandmother founded the church that is now in the mix back in the 1960s even as early as the 50s and when she found the church my grandfather came to the Lord and she gave that church over to him my grandfather being a very yet eager man a very uh uh a humble man but yet also a man with driven desire had a desire to see something go further than him himself he had a desire to see things go out and and I did not get the opportunity to meet my grandfather because he died the year before I was born understanding Legacy he started to build something and the church that is now in the Dream Center where we started out of was a building it was two homes he purchased one home and then Baltimore at its stage back in that time he purchased the second home for a dollar can y'all imagine a dollar do you understand how much property I would buy right now if somebody said it was available for a dollar he purchased this property and his idea his vision was to expand these two buildings and to break down the wall and expand it into the space that if you've been there before you understand it's not just one side but it's two sides and so he he purchased it with the idea that something greater would come from it I think that's in reference to what we've got to talk about it's often times we do not understand the power of seed and we don't understand the power of what planting a seed can do sometimes we're oftentimes looking from a generational perspective and only saying to ourselves what I'm doing is for now and I don't have an idea that what I'm doing now is impacting what happens next I want to say that to you because if my grandfather had thought about it he would have only done the things that are impacting his life for today he would have only made the decision to buy what he could afford today to make the decision to do things according to what was looking good today but he understood there is a future to come I want you to recognize today you have a future to come there's something greater on the way my grandfather purchases these two homes and then when he passes my grandmother takes over the church and creates and expands the church the church begins to develop and begins to grow and and begins to move in a mighty way and she establishes and now this church as she passes is transformed over to my mother a mother a part of this Legacy in whom my grandfather never knew would take over has something that has been established because of a seed he had sown can I tell you the importance of a seed can establish and declare your family your generational and Community Direction Just because of the seed you sown understanding that you have the ability to impact areas around you beyond what you could ever imagine or think I want to let you know some of what you're doing today has nothing to do with you and everything to do what's coming after you some of what you're doing is establishing things that will forever be known as your name that will forever be a part of saying this was the individual who took it further than ever before my grandfather who established that brought us into this my mother took over this ministry and even grew it and took it to a new place that it became behold Ministries and and we saw lives change Minds being one of them but nobody saw this happening because oftentimes we look at the future according to what we see right now if it would have been up to those who knew my mom would not have been the one that took over the church because she's the feisty one she's the one that's a little rebellious she's the one that will ask the questions that no one else wants to ask she's the one that is going to get down to the truth of the matter she's the one that's going to tell you either you're going to change or you're going to stay the same she's the one that's going to break the barriers in your life she's the one that's going to give you some truth whether you like it or not she's the one that's going to help you get from where you are to where God has for you to be and God established her to create this church that could make an impact in the difference the idea is that no one knew exactly what was coming next and my question is you may know where you're going to work tomorrow but do you know what's going to happen in 10 years and are you sowing and creating for what's to come or are you surviving for what's available we will create it for next now my mom doesn't know even though she has prophesied over my life many times that God is going to use you and your sister I never forget she said that over and over I never forget she used to declare that over my life I never forget she used to say it over and I would say I'm not pastoring I don't care what you say I don't care what you tell me we would be in meetings I'm not doing it I told her I'm going on the road to travel so I could be a torn musician leave me out of this I'll help you I'll do whatever is possible I'll give you Direction I'll I'll be a part of everything I'm just not pastoring here's the thing I'm wondering what are you telling God you won't do what's the thing that that the Lord has spoken to you like no that's not me I don't do that let me let me give you my resume God because you don't know my skill sets you don't understand how I operate you know I don't like people I would never do that Lord that just doesn't even make sense you know I don't work that way you know I don't live in that place you know that's not the kind of things that I do and God is saying you don't even know you because what God had done before the foundation of the world was that he had already created you and configured you now what the world does is it disrupts who we are so that we lose the identity of who God's called for us to be but the problem that goes with that is that we begin to accept the identity that sin begins to put a label on us not understanding that what's really inside of us is something greater than we ever could imagine or think and the Bible lets us know that there are greater things inside of us but the problem is it's hard to see because it's buried so deep all of a sudden in 2014 I come in and say Mom I believe the Lord has called me to Pastor everything that I said was shoved right back inside of my mouth I had no words to say I didn't know why I said it but here's what I understood was that God called me not to a skill but to a calling I'm wondering if you're only living out of your skill and not your calling I wonder if you understand what God has purposed you to do not just skilled you to do because there's a potential inside of you to do greater than you ever could imagine or think but if you don't grab a hold of what God wants to do in your life you will stay right where you are and I promise you wherever it is that you want to stay it's the most comfortable place for you to be because you're in control of it you have your hands on it you know what to do with it you know where you want to go next here's how I can tell you when God gets a hold of your life you have no clue in what in the world you are doing what you do understand is that I've been placed here for a purpose and a calling and a reason I don't know why I don't know why he would use me I don't understand why he would even call me but the thing of it is is he chose me I want to tell somebody in here that God chose you regardless of your education regardless of your people's skills regardless of how much you like people and don't like people regardless of what you think you are to do God has chosen you so you just need to get over it tell your neighbor real quick get over it he chose you because you were created for next the issue that we're getting at is that God has already established you and brought you into the Bible says a wealthy place but oftentimes the reason that we're not intentional with our now is because we don't value our next you don't value the seed you just value the Harvest God what can I get God says well what can you give in order to receive there has to be a giving without sowing there is no reaping you can act like you have a harvest you can steal from other people's harvests you can copy other people's harvests you can you see that you don't even have and and take from other crops that you don't really find yourself harvesting but here's the truth of the matter is you'll know when it's your seed because you did the work to get the Harvest the Bible lets us know the Harvest is plentiful but laborers are few we love to use that for church where is the people that want to work in the church where are the laborers God that's what that's where we're praying we use that voice because that's a it's a it has it has a has it has weight to it we are the laborers but the truth of the matter is God is saying we're the laborers out in the workplace that are called to speak my name as I'm blessing them and taking them to the next levels where are the people that were created for next because if you get comfortable all you will do is make decisions off of your now and I can promise you now that your now is speaking to your desires that you have today not the outcome that you want to see later anybody ever found themselves at the place I mean Pastor Ty this is his example I'll give him all the credit for it now when you go to the supermarket anybody have a shop hungry what happens when you shop hungry everybody broke out oh my gosh you get back home and realize you didn't even buy [Applause] what you were supposed to get [Applause] you got cakes [Applause] double cream pies cereal then you're supposed to be meal prepping you forgot all the meal so you ain't got no prep because when you shop out of your now you're only shopping and moving for the things that you desire Where You Are not what you want to see come forth my question is what you see in your life now is a result of the seed that you were sowing in your past anything that I'm frustrated with now has some result of my past and I've got to change my noun in order to change my future but the problem is is if I don't understand that then I keep reacting to my somebody say my now what I need you to do is live out understanding there's a next and everything that you're doing now impacts your next if right now you're sowing a seed financially in your life to be rich then you probably need to delete that doordash that's requiring you to purchase a 12 meal with a 399 fee a 17 tax a 22 dollar tip that all you did was order a sandwich and it came out to 75-32 I know you know about it because you looked at the total at the end and said what in God's name did I get you go back to the cart like what did we buy for 45 dollars and all you see is three chicken wings two fries and a ginger ale because you're hungry now but you did not sow a seed to put something in the fridge that will put you at a place that you did not have to desire for what would not impact your life and be good for you later financially you want to get ahead but the problem is is that you keep sowing the seed that once a harvest now and my question is is what will you do to change your now that will impact your next the idea is that if I can understand the seeds also now I can do something about what's next here's the thing it's hard to offer God something now when your next is all about you any anybody know it's it's not it's it's hard to talk about this in a uh post present covet state because oftentimes I'm thinking about me today now and when I think about me today now I'm not even thinking bad I'm just thinking Limited here's what I want to say we have to expand our thinking not to be so limited in the way that we see so that we can allow God to move in our life not level before Matthew chapter 16 it references this thing about forgetting about yourself it says that it says forget about yourself it says if you give up your life for me you will actually find it if if you give up life for me you'll find it that sounds crazy Pastor Hama finds something I give up Jesus is like if you give it up for me you'll find a life for me then Galatians lets us know in chapter five he says and when you give that life up for me the spirit will impact and change and he says this he says at the result of God's presence in your life you'll have these fruits of the spirit which is joy peace patience it says this and you'll have the ability to have kindness and goodness and faithfulness and gentleness and when you get to the supermarket self-control because the idea is that because you're creative for next you got to sow something now here's a problem with now sewing now sewing doesn't show Harvest anybody ready for a blessing now I could pull the musicians right out and we could just shout this thing down like God's gonna give you a blessing now and we and you'll be like yeah he gonna give it he's gonna get and I'll just be like wait real quick did you sow anything because it'd be real good to shout you up as long as you sow I can I can take you there if you got a seat but without a seed I can't get you a harvest because there's nothing for a seed to happen time to happen and then a harvest to happen and I need all three of those things for you to see the blessings of God because just shouting enough that your feet get to move it's not enough and just working hard is not enough because there's some things that God has for you that is pre-existing the ability for you to create it yourself God has some things in your life that you can't even work out through your job and your race some of you are actually limited by your job and by your race because you believe it's the Pinnacle of where you can get to and God says there are things that I have for your life that are so much greater than what you could ever imagine I actually have some things where you probably will work Less hours and make more money and you could be a better blessing and do better things but the problem is you become a little bit afraid because you're used to the pattern of making your own way and doing it your own style and you look at other people and say how are you out in the middle of the golf course in the mid of the day sitting there looking all happy and I'm up here where working like my tail is crazy and God is saying cause you didn't trust me don't get mad because I decided to trust him then and what you're seeing now is the seed of what he's done you get what I'm saying there's no it's no need to get excited no need to get all all up in your feelings because you made the decision not to sow the seed and the problem was not so in the seed is that now you're not reaping the Harvest why you want to look at everybody else don't get mad because I made the fake step and you didn't because God is ready to work on your behalf much quicker than you think he is because he's already created you for the next things and he's already created you for things you've never even seen before but if you do not have a next mentality then we cannot get to the next thing God's called us to so we got to have a next mentality somebody say a next mentality I've got to know that what I'm doing now is affecting what's happening next and if I can get that then I can get an understanding that God wants to move in a way like never before but I have to find myself doing three different things the first thing that I want you to be able to do is to have intentionally I want you to intentionally pray [Applause] I need you to intentionally pray not accidentally get there like in intentional prayer means I know where I'm going anybody right now you may be doing devotions and I'm telling you that is phenomenal but where I want to get you to as the Bible says we move from milk to meat I want to get you to a place where your prayer time with God is not something to be checked off on your Bible at it is not something to keep up with the random understanding that if I don't do this God will be mad no I want you to get into the place where you're before God and you sit down like let's get this thing going I got some things that come before you with I've got some places in my life I need you to change I need some direction on where I'm going I need some answers that you can move in my life but it only comes through intentional prayer because if we're not intentionally praying then we're only personally moving and you're moving because you want God to do anybody can say this and by no prayer gets hard can can I can I get some real people to tell prayers heart anybody know prayer to be real hard anybody know sitting there with God nobody you feel like it's talking to you pray it gets hard you go down on your knees you start with Lord and you don't remember what happened after that and I've been there before knocked out wake up in a panic oh God did you hear anything now you want to quote the scripture he knows my heart but he didn't hear your mouth if I can tell your prayers actually hard y'all flow into this idea of that it's just so easy because especially when life is hitting and I'm frustrated prayer can be hard prayer can be a hard place where I'm trying to find the words to say anybody ever asked a question am I doing it right you ever been there before you're like is it do it work I don't how do I start off gracious God you're taking you're taking lines off of Kings of Comedy what did Steve Harvey say gracious God our Father should I start that way I'm not really sure what I should do how should I flow with this what's the way that I really can get to get because here's the thing you want to pray effectively so much that God hears you because you believe that God has a way in which he needs to be able to hear from you that he can only receive that in which you pray a very specific way you probably heard somebody pray probably heard me pray it's like Lord I don't pray like that I don't even know what Yahweh is I can't even spell it never heard of it and I can't go that direction here's what I want to let you know today is that prayer gets hard when you run out of problems see we when you run out of situations anybody no prayer can get hard when life is happening you got a prayer life can I can I get an amen right there you can seek God while he may be found or lost you before I mean you God I know you there I have seen you I've seen the heavens move in the star I need you to get this promotion from me I'm sick of being broke we're not at a loss for words when we're in a situation or a moment where we need God to move but anybody ever seen life go well and your prayer life don't seem to be as needed anymore I got my money my house was great my car is good I'm good my now you get to God and you're trying to figure out well what am I asking you for and God is saying oh I didn't know that's the relationship we had I I thought it was a relationship where I was in Covenant with you and you were in Covenant with me and and I was telling you what was next not because you were in a broken place or in a broken situation I thought I was God in your life I thought in all your ways you were acknowledging me and I was directing your path I thought that I was the one to tell you when to go and when to stop I thought through prayer there was this intentionality that was happening I thought that's what we were doing I didn't know that your only use for me was to get you out of things because when that becomes your prayer life then you find yourself at a place that God's got to keep you in trouble to stay connected with you because it's the only way you'll come to him is that if something's going wrong instead of showing up and saying I just wanted to tell you today there is none like you in all the Earth there's nothing going wrong my babies look good I'm trying to tell you we nice and healthy but I just wanted to tell you today you did not have to use me the way that you used me I want to let you know today that you did not have to keep me the way that you kept me I want to let you know today I'm sitting up in this house laying in this bed and I want to tell you you did not have to open the door for us to sit here I just want to let you know if you don't do anything else you've already done enough I just wanted to remind you that the only reason I'm still working and got this job is because you're faithful I just wanted to tell you today the reason why I'm still in good health is not because I found myself at the place where I exercise all the time you're keeping and watching you have a hedge of protection over me I just thought I would thank you today thank you because that's what he thought this was going to be he thought it was going to be according to who he is not what he could do for you that's where the turn in the relationship starts to move and the person that's created for next is a person that's intentionally praying I'm intentionally asking God to God my steps and got my direction and where am I going my question today is where you are a direct connection of what you asked God to do and if God has brought you to the place of an answer prayer are you honoring him through your prayer [Applause] here's the thing God God answers so many prayers that we don't live out in honor God do for me God opened the door God blessed me with the mate God says I'll do it he said but what he told Solomon was but I need you to follow my ways I need you to adhere to what I've called you to do even when it's not favorable for your now called intentionally pray we got 21 days of prayer coming up January the 8th prayer and fasting I saw a teardrop faster prayer and fasting a time where we can put some things aside hear from God put some food aside put some social media aside and go back to relationship with God instead of requisition for God God wants you to ask of him let me not get you wrong but he wants you to ask of him with intentional prayers of building relationship not building consumership scripture says in Philippians 4 and 6 it says do not be anxious or wary do not be anxious or worried about somebody say anything but in everything every circumstance and situation by prayer some of where you can defeat the enemy in your anxiety is in your prayer life if you're not praying if you're not before God your anxiety is going to run crazy because you don't have a place to take your burdens the Bible says that let that be known it says so by prayer and supplication petition assets supplication that's my old King James Spirit by prayer and petition and it says this with Thanksgiving father I need you father I know father I understand father I need you to move right now but just in the middle of it let me let you know that you are good you are faithful you are God all by yourself thank you he said with Thanksgiving continue to make your somebody say specific requests known to God intentionally pray specific prayers how can I pray specific if I don't know what God is saying I need to know what God's will is second thing I need you to have intentional plans the question to start out with do you just have plans do you have plans of what's next Pastor I I don't know where I'm going why because I don't know what God is saying have you been praying well yeah I pray intentionally well yeah or was it intentionally for the requests but not intentional for the direction if we're created for next we're asking God what is a plan the spirit said the Bible says that the spirit gave David plans on what to do anybody ever have plans imma start and tell you well when I took over this church I had plans but I had no idea how to do them I want to confirm with somebody today you've got plans that you have no clue of how to do there is something in your mind and in your heart that God has given you that you have no clue of what to do I'm going to tell you that's God plans right there I'm going to open up this place and I'm going to move and I'm going to do and everybody around you is saying how you gonna do that and you're like oh I have no clue see here's the thing I can have plans to build a house and have no clue how to build it that's not my part he's the architect all I got to do is have the plans and about listen you need to go and write them plans out and pull them out like a blueprint and just spread them out like yeah look look at that that is amazing oh my look at that that's about 5 000 square feet right there my question today oh I want to ask somebody have you drawn out the plans even though you don't know how to build laughs have you God spoke to you and told you did you draw the plans out did you draw him out did you put oh okay so once I go here that's how I talked to God once we go here we're gonna rebuild it but then when we rebuild it we're gonna make sure it gets better and then once we build that we're gonna draw that out and then the flesh side of me is saying how you gonna do that you ain't got no money and guess what I go back oh that's not my part you would dream again if you understood where the responsibility lied if you understood it's not your responsibility to get there it's just your responsibility to believe oh my gosh you would be looking oh look at this you know what I'm gonna add another thousand square feet on there it's gonna be magnificent are you for real I'm for real this is going to be amazing but we're scared to build because we believe it's our responsibility to Resource the plan but all you got to do is just get that plan roller what you want how many bedrooms I was thinking six but I had a real good prayer today so I'm going for seven [Applause] anybody want to touch and agree with me on that one you anybody need to go home and just buy here here I'm going to tell you something to do and you can think about it all year I dare you go to a Michael's I dare you go to an arts and crafts place and buy a huge big piece of paper or go and buy a poster board and start drawing out God's dreams foreign listen you clear that kitchen table I'll be like ah all them Christmas decorations ah I can over here I gotta draw my new house [Applause] y'all crazy if you were crazy enough you'd do it you push that all up you'll be like I get that all over all right cool all right what are we gonna do I'm thinking a pool over here you're saying I want to change lives and what your thinking is is that you can do it alone so you're saying you and your degree are going to go change all the world but the problem is is you didn't start writing a plan out for you and the company and the employees that you're going to have that's going to change the world you will go to that kitchen table and just knock everything off and be like all right let's start from new I need six employees over here and when we build the building I need about 10.5 million and then when we get here we're going to take over East Baltimore and West Baltimore and then you will walk out frame it and put it up there and say all right God get to work [Music] foreign enough to go in that dining room table clear everything up all right so much my college funds gonna be paid for because they're going over here at least if they go to Harvard I know I got that and we got this right here and then when I go over here God you already showed me that I was gonna conquer and take over more than I could imagine a thing so when I do that I look at it I'm gonna go back to the praying and say God whenever you ready I'm ready I got intentionally playing when you're not intentionally planning what are you doing you're hoping I hope this happened I mean I hope he do it and then you end off your prayer but if you don't let your will be done God's like okay cool you don't want to do the work that's fine what's your part to have faith and the Bible says faith without works is dead Pastor I don't have a dining room or kitchen table you better get on that floor all right all right first thing I'm gonna draw is a kitchen table first thing I'm gonna put on here is the dining room table I just need to start at a basic but let me get this going first before I sit out here and buy a two million dollar house I mean let me get this apartment going right now let me draw the plans I can get some more plans later there's some more paper at Michaels I need I need to start at ground level but you can allow God to intentionally work in moving your life First Corinthians 2 and 9 says is that a scripture says no one has ever seen no one has ever heard and no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him that's a shout moment if you were in a good church that you would just go in a corner and just begin to praise God like this because you would understand that God is trying to do things in your life that you've never seen before I dare you and your husband go and pull out that paper and say this is what we believe God's going to use us to do but we're not acting out our faith like that anymore we're just saying whatever happens I'll take it God's like we don't have to do that because I've given plans that you've never seen things you never acknowledge places you've never gone before but we don't think about that scripture which says write it out make it plain you cannot recreate you cannot move you cannot operate with vision that you have no plan for we gonna build the house all right how many square feet I don't know where you where you want to build it oh I don't know oh wait so where you want to go I don't know I'm not sure if you've ever been on a house search but for me I intentionally know what I wanted to look like I intentionally know where I want to live I'm sitting it right now you could go in my phone and see research for all the plans that I wish I had the money to be able to do and if I got a cart that's sitting there waiting for the Holy Spirit man I got a cart that's sitting there I'm waiting for the Holy Spirit to press continue please order because I ain't got no money for it God I need you to place this order that's where we gotta be God what do you want to do I'm into I'm searching it I'm researching it I know exactly where to get it from when he says yes my wife is sitting there what you doing oh just looking at the next house already don't listen I'm doing now for what's to come because I was created for next last point number three God's called you to intentionally move there's an intentional move that you've got to do we've written out the plan we've we're working that out God's got to Resource it but now I got to start moving God I don't know what's next I don't know what you called me to I don't I don't know how I'm gonna make this happen but here's what I'm gonna do I'm going to start moving towards it gotta want Financial Freedom God's saying okay then I need you to sow a seed that you believe me enough that when you sow that seed I'm going to work something out I'll never forget it was about three years ago when we were doing our passion offering I was saying to myself I'm not sure how we gonna give it but we're gonna give it now forget that and I and I never forget I was saying I told my wife I said right now we need a this was uh this wasn't even passion offer I said right now we need about a thousand dollars because I need a thousand to be able just to cover some things and put some things into perspective because I want to Steward it well and I'll never forget a moment happened I had to teach somewhere I hear you Lord I had to teach somewhere and I'll never forget they wrote me a check and the check was for a thousand dollars I was like come on high five god let's do it I got a prayer life at least for the next week all right and I'll never forget sitting in the car I got in the car I just received the check I got in the car my wife got in the car beside me and I heard the Lord said now give it [Applause] Satan you are a liar but like you not talk in my ear I'll never forget it never forget it never forget it never forget it I honked my horn and my wife she rolls down the window I said um uh the Lord told me but if if you didn't hear it then the Bible says to agree needed to be you know we need to be in agreement on this I said so um the Lord told me to give this money that we have been praying for in our passion offering and she looked at me she said give it and she rolled up the window now I think she's crying on the other side I'm pretty sure that tears [Music] we give it and I never forget we weren't even asking God for a home but God opened up the door for a home in a matter of three months [Music] pause it closing costs everything we needed we moved in within three months time never forget it and I'll never forget I did not do it because that's what I knew was coming I did it to sow a seed now because I knew God had something on the way I want to tell you this today there's something that God needs you to move on and he's speaking it right now whatever it is I'm telling you it's right now and you had the opportunity to capture the moment now for next or you have the opportunity to sit on now and not see next come to fruition but I'm telling you today whatever God is speaking in your heart I need you to go and say yes Lord not when you got it not when you understand it not when you got a plan for it I just need you to be obedient right now and just say yes Lord I don't know what it is I don't know if he's asking you to do something go somewhere change something sow something whatever it is I just need you to say yes Lord and from that I promise you that God is going to do a next in your life real quick Once you turn to your neighbor and tell them real quick say do it you know you know what it is they looking at you like um I'm not the to it Psalms 37 23 says this the steps of a good man are directed and established by the Lord when he Delights in his ways and he busies himself with his every step your steps are ordered by God I just need you to say yes today I need you to give God a yes wherever it is I don't need you to figure it out I just need you to give God a yes today I never forget when we when I had my first job I started my first job and I was young I was real young well not my first job my first real job my first job was at youth Works my mother made me do that so yeah that yeah I've been working a long long time but uh my first job at Hopkins not the one I got fired from the the first job um I never forget [Music] when I got to orientation they said all right you're gonna start on Monday I said awesome and they said the pay is every two weeks and we're on a pay week I said come on I get paid Friday look at God I said but I don't like butts y'all they said but you're going to have to work two weeks in the hole I said what is a hole what what do you mean a whole work two weeks in a hole for what I work this week give me my money I said no no you got to work two weeks in a hole so that you can receive your first paycheck and then you'll always have a paycheck coming that week after I'm here today to let somebody know that God's calling for you to sow and I'm here to tell you you will not see the Harvest in two weeks but there is a harvest and the Bible says this be not weary in your well-doing for in due season you will reap a harvest if you faint not God is calling for you to do something now that right at the age of when you're about to faint he is going to blow your mind and I'm believing that today I believe each and every person in here you were created for next and God wants to do something more than you could ever imagine think
