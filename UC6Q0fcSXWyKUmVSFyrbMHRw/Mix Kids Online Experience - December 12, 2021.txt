[Music] [Music] welcome to mixed kids thanks for tuning in this week when i was a little girl we used to sing this song called the 12 days of christmas it's such a funny song maybe later on we'll play a little bit for you what type of light do you like to use a candle light a flashlight a night light a strobe light have you ever been in a dark room and it feels creepy especially at night there are many people who sleep with a nightlife a night light is not a super bright light like sunlight it's a soft light that keeps darkness from overpowering the earth that's the thing about light when light shows up darkness disappears light brings things into focus so that we can see them clearly have you ever seen an incredible display of christmas lights you know like the one we saw last week maybe it was to a set of music or the lights went and danced around or flashed around like maybe with song have you ever driven down the street in your neighborhood that is completely lit up and the lights are bright on each house last week we looked at a display of light today we're going to look at some crazy lights last week's lights were beautiful this week's lights are a little crazy let's take a look [Music] time [Music] so [Music] those were some crazy christmas lights right in our series light of the world we are talking about being light everywhere that we go last week we learned that the light of jesus lives in us just like with daniel today we are learning that the light of jesus make darkness run this means that when the light of jesus is alive inside of you you don't have to live in fear or hide or wary your light brings hope to others so there is a man by the name of gideon in a bible who used his light to defeat an army without using any weapons oh my goodness let's take a look god story gideon so part of god's story is about a man named gideon and it begins like this israel god's special family had turned against the one real god and worshiped idols they had forgotten how god had loved and cared for them and needed a reminder that he was the one in charge so god took away the israelites farms for seven long years whenever the israelites planted crops god would let another nation called the midianites sweep through and camp on israel's land ruining everything that was growing there but even though his own family had forgotten him god still loved them deeply so at the end of the seven years god appeared to a young israelite named gideon god said he was going to free the israelites with gideon's help gideon however wasn't so sure so he asked god to prove himself by performing a series of miracles gideon said if the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry then i will know that you're going to help me rescue israel as you promised that's what happened just to be sure the next night gideon asked god to do the opposite make the fleece dry and make the ground wet and god did it next he even sent a sign through an angel gideon was finally convinced that god was in his corner so he called together an army to fight against the midianites now normally having lots of people is a good thing when you're about to battle but like i said god does things a bit differently he told gideon that the israelites had too many soldiers if they won now god knew the israelites would say it was because of their own strength and brag about it so god wanted gideon to have a smaller army gideon was nervous but he did as god asked which is always a good idea by the way he told his men that if they were afraid they could return home with that 22 000 soldiers left leaving gideon with about ten thousand for you math whizzes that's two-thirds of his army just poof gone even after all that the army was still too big so god told gideon to take the soldiers down to the water to drink and then send home the soldiers who drank out of the stream like dogs again gideon did what god asked and was now left with only 300 soldiers god knew gideon was probably worried so he told him to sneak down to the enemy camp where gideon heard soldiers talking about a crazy dream where a loaf of bread rolled into the midianite camp and over their tent one soldier said that could only mean that gideon would triumph over them gideon returned to his own camp confident that he would win the battle he divided his men into three groups and gave them each a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside not usually what you bring to a fight but god had a plan gideon's army reached the edge of the midianite camp and then went into action they blew their trumpets smashed their jars and shouted a sword for the lord and for gideon and don't forget they did all of this without a single weapon in their hands terrified the midianites fled accidentally attacking each other as they went in fact they ran so far from the battlefield that other israelites were able to capture and defeat the leaders of the midianites with the enemy leaders gone and their army running away god had saved israel just like he said he would and that's the story of gideon so in case you missed it here's the quick version israel turned away from god god reminded them he was in charge god said he would save israel he would use gideon god performed miracles for gideon gideon gathered an army god made it smaller much smaller soldiers had a dream gideon's army surprised their enemies the midianites ran away god used gideon to save israel and that's a part of god's story gideon was afraid when god first gave him his mission to help the israelites fight the midianites yet he did not let fear stop him from doing what god had told him to do as soon as he knew god was speaking and he so he trusted god he went ahead and fought with only 300 men god gave him the faith to overcome his fear gideon used the light of jesus to make darkness run isn't that an amazing story guys i know right our memory verse for this series and the one that we learned last week says this you
