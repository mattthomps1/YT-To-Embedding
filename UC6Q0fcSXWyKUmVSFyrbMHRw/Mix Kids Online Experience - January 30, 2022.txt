[Music] [Music] good morning guys welcome to mix kids we are so happy that you are watching today we are going to talk about being given to the lord last week we learned how hannah prayed to god for a son god answered hannah's prayer and finally gave her a wonderful son that she desired later she said i prayed for this child and the lord has granted me what i asked for of him so now i give him to the lord for his whole life he will be giving over to the lord first samuel 1 27 and 28 samuel then went to the house of the lord at shiloh and worshiped god there with eli the priest today i have a colorful necklace made with fruit loops and a paper cross this will help us to remember to dedicate all areas of our lives to jesus the colored loops can represent some of these areas orange represents friends green represents family purple represents church red represents sports blue represents television and yellow represents school or any other activity you may have dedicating your whole life to the lord means to give the right balance to all areas of your life that is why the colored loops representing these areas are balanced on both sides of the necklace as you wear your necklace these colors will help you to remember to dedicate these areas and give them the right priorities in order to please god for example god would not be pleased if you chose to spend too much time playing with your friends when you should be reading your bible on the other hand god want you to spend time with your friends if it involves sharing jesus with them watching television is okay but it would be much less of a priority compared to doing your homework hannah dedicated samuel to god and samuel lived for god let's take a look in a country called ephraim a man named akana lived with his wife hannah hannah was very sad because she did not have any children hannah wanted to have a family every year alcona went to the tabernacle to make sacrifices to god and to worship him hannah went with him hannah prayed to god lord if you give me a son i will dedicate him to you he will serve you all of his life a priest named eli was sitting near the doorpost of the tabernacle eli watched anna pray he couldn't hear her but he saw her lips moving eli thought there was something wrong with hannah hannah explained i've been pouring out my heart before the lord eli replied go in peace may god answer your prayers hannah and elkanah returned home and god did answer her prayers after some time hannah gave birth to a son she named him samuel when samuel was no longer a baby hannah took him to eli at the tabernacle god answered my prayers she said hannah pledged samuel to serve god and she worshipped god hannah returned home and left samuel with eli to serve god every year hannah returned with a new robe for samuel and god gave hannah many more children eli was getting old and his sons served as priest in the tabernacle eli heard that his sons were sinning against god eli asked his sons why they were sinning but they did not listen to him samuel on the other hand grew older and found favor with god and with men one night eli was in his bed and samuel was lying in the tabernacle when samuel heard someone call his name he ran to eli here i am you called me but it wasn't eli he told samuel to go back to bed god called samuel three times and each time samuel ran to eli here i am he said eli finally understood that god was calling to samuel he told samuel how to respond samuel went back to his place and god called samuel samuel speak for your servant is listening samuel replied god told samuel that he was going to judge eli's family for their sin the next day samuel was afraid to tell eli what god had said eli asked samuel to tell him what god said so samuel did as samuel grew god was with him everyone in israel knew that samuel was god's messenger god used samuel to share his plan with the nation of israel samuel used god's words to tell the people what god is like john chapter 1 verse 1 says that jesus is the word jesus the son of god told the world about god's plan and showed what god is like when we talk about dedicating things to the lord we have a wonderful example in hannah she asked god for a son and promised that if he gave her one she would dedicate him back to god for all of his life it was no doubt a difficult thing for hannah to let go of and give her some back to the lord but she kept her promise she wanted to honor god and give him the glory likewise it is sometimes hard for us to dedicate our lives to the lord however we must remember that everything we have is a gift from god our families our homes our talent our education our jobs when we grow up and even our whole lives are a gift from god therefore we should dedicate all that we have back to the lord for his glory and honor to do this we need to give the right priorities and balance to our responsibilities for example we should not be spending too much time at church if it means neglecting our families likewise we should not enjoy the company of our friends too much if it means skipping our homework everything we do and the amount of time that we do it should be pleasing to god our memory verse for this week says i call on you my god for you will answer me turn your ear to me and hear my prayer psalm 17 and 6. awesome job everyone before we
