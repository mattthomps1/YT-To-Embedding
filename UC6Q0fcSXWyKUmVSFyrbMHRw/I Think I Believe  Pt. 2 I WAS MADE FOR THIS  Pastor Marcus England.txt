would love for you to be able to connect with us you can highlight you can underline you can have an opportunity if you don't have your bible don't feel bad at all we will have the scriptures available but here's what i encourage you i encourage you that after we finish today that you go back and read these scriptures that you allow them to be a part of your life and allow yourselves to meditate on the word of god and then i want you to take out your notepads because there may be one thing that you catch that god has been ready to say to you for a while and you're in the right atmosphere in the right moment for god to speak for god to answer a prayer for god to give you insight in a way like you haven't before so i want you to capture a hold of that as we jump into the word of god can you turn to psalms 139 psalms 139 [Music] if you have it say amen amen we're going to get you on the bible reading plan so we can get you to these scriptures faster it's on page 172 no i'm just praying y'all it's not a hymnal everybody bibles looks differently psalm 139 i want to start at verse 13. i want you to put a little star there if you've got your bible it's a really really great scripture to go back and reap yourself those of you that are online we're so glad that you're with us from all over the world thank you for joining us being a home of welcome home sunday we love our mixed family online and we're so grateful for you as you're jumping into the word of god we believe that god has something to say jump in on the chats chime in let us know that you're listening to what god is speaking psalms 139 verse 13 and it says this for you somebody say you for you formed my inwards parts [Music] it says you knitted me together in my mother's womb this is david david is a man of the old testament in whom the lineage of christ is a part of and connected with david is a king david is also known as a man after god's own heart and david is writing the psalms to give himself an opportunity to express where he is but in his expression in david writing he's letting us know something and he's speaking he's expressing his thoughts to the lord he says you for me and my inward parts and you knitted me together in my mother's womb he says this i praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made i just want to tell somebody today who might have come in i'm trying to let you know your hair got messed up in the rain a little bit and you're feeling a little tricky about how you feel i want to let you know today that you are fearfully and wonderfully made he says wonderful are your works my soul knows it very well my frame was not hidden from you when i was being made in secret intricately woven in the depths of the earth he says your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written somebody say every no say it again every in your book were written every one of them the days that were formed were formed not being formed not will be formed the days that were formed from me when as yet there was none of them and he ends in this place and where i'm ending he doesn't end but the song keeps going but i wanted to and it says this how precious to me are your thoughts oh god how fast is the sum of them if you could write down today or putting your your phone as a title for the message today i want to say this i was made for this just tell your neighbor real quick i was made for this come on you got to tell your neighbor again say i was made for this i want to talk today to talk about a place where i believe it's important where our first topic and message was about you believing in whom god is who he says he is and who he has declared to already be i want to give you an opportunity to move not just from the basis of what we believe about god but i now want to move to the basis of what we believe that god is saying about me today i believe it's important that if you cannot grasp this next part which is a very important part to your walk and the fellowship of what god is speaking today if you cannot believe in yourself where you will find yourself is in a place where you will feel sorry for where you are and not feel encouraged about where you are going can i tell you today you're going somewhere can i speak this over your life whether you feel it whether you don't i want to let you know that you have been created to go somewhere god did not establish your life god did not create you and form you and and in the very secret places put you together for you to end up in a space of feeling lost and disconnected god created you for a purpose today i want to let you know that you are not here by accident but you are here because god wants to speak in your life that in more than just believing about everybody around you you're called to believe in you today listen we have this idea of where we oftentimes spend a lot of moments that we are in our life making sure that everybody's okay if you have children you spend most of your time making sure they're all right they're they're fine there's nothing wrong with them you're taking care of them you're watching over them you're making sure they're good but can i be a little bit selfish on today can i get into a place where i can talk to you for a moment that it doesn't matter if you believe in everybody else because if you believe in everyone else but don't believe in yourself you will push everybody to the next level and you will stay right where you are if you don't get this concept it's going to put you in a place where you're always going to be asking lord where is somebody for me where is somebody that is willing to speak into my life but as the psalmist who wrote this says sometimes there's nobody around to speak on your behalf you've got to speak to your self the context of speaking to yourself is important but the only way you can properly speak to yourself is to know in whom god has created you to be and if you don't know or understand who god has created you to be then where you will find things complicated is is that you will be wandering from here to there is if you are worth what god has said i believe today that god has spoken to many of us but the problem is is that we don't believe what god is saying god has spoken vision over our life god has given us concepts and beliefs and understanding but what you're doing is looking at the current situation of where you are and you are measuring yourself according to yourself anybody ever been there before that as you measure yourself according to yourself the problem is is that you haven't seen yourself move any further than where you are right now and the greatest that you see of yourself is what you have accomplished in your past but i'm here today to let you know is that as david wrote there was something that god was doing in the secret before the time were even put together before the earth was even created he was thinking about you he was forming you in the secret places he was hiding you behind the veil making sure that as he created you there was something unique and special to your designer he didn't let the angels know about you he didn't let the earth know about you yet he said because i'm working on something special here's what i want to declare over your life today you are something special that god has been working on before the foundation of the world and he has just been waiting to release you in your right season so that you can see every area of your life blossom according to the purpose he said over your life i gotta preach this to you today because if you don't believe in you then you will fall at the wayside and every morning you wake up you'll have a complaint in your heart and you won't have a praise unto god why because when life has no purpose it sucks [Music] you wake up every morning looking for something to motivate you but the problem is is that within us we don't always have the encouragement to motivate ourselves and god is saying i need you to have something greater in your life than what you think will be in your bank account what you think you will drive what you think you will live in it needs to be a greater aspiration to your life than the things that you have he's saying i place the purpose inside of you and there's something special about who you are can you just tell your neighbor real quick you're special there's something unique there's something exact about you that's like no one else in the world right now if i made you put your finger on some ink and place it on a piece of paper it would define who you are there would be nobody else that has lived and will live that will have your fingerprint why because you are unique you are complex you are wonderfully made right but if you don't believe that then what the way you live your life is you live your life by looking at everyone else's life and you copy everyone else's life to fit your mode and now you become a template and everything that god worked on in secret has now become a copy my question today is are you good with being a copy or do you want to be an original [Applause] see to be an original means that you have to think on your own it means you have to stabilize yourself tyron enough that when god is speaking and he's speaking to you the things that feel like they're beyond what you could even imagine or even dream of you have to capture a whole by faith not because you think but because you believe that everything that god has spoken is already yes and amen which means it is so so as he speaks i have to capture a whole not by looking at what's around me but i'm looking what is inside of me and saying god if you spoke it to me that means that there's something inside of me that has not been developed yet that can come out of me to be something incredible but god's saying i'm waiting on you just tell your neighbor real quick god's waiting on you i gotta preach this to you real quick so you know god's waiting on you why because the answer is is that while god is waiting on you he says i've already finished to work why can't i say god's waiting is because if god finished the work it means that he's trying to align you in timing with the destiny and the purpose that he has over your life what the problem is is that you're putting roadblocks in the way relationships and wrong ways of doing in the way and he's saying your blessing and destiny has always been standing right here i never moved it i never put anything in place of it it's always been right there but you keep putting obstacles in the place of it and i'm trying to get you there but you're taking too long tell your neighbor you're taking too long [Applause] you're taking too long because you don't believe in yourself and so you're slow stepping and you're getting off course and you're getting off the path and you're asking people about who you are and they have no clue because they don't even know who they are because the only person that can give you the clarity of who you are and what you should be is not your mama it's not your daddy it's not your best friend it's not your husband it's not your wife it is the almighty creator himself [Applause] god says everything that i have for you is already waiting for you to occupy canaan for the children of israel that came out of bondage the bible lets us know that god had already had a promised land he wasn't creating a promised land he wasn't building a promise can i tell you that everything that god has for you is already waiting on you you just got to take the journey to get there can i be honest with some of us we don't like journeys we we we we trying to promote ourselves there we're trying to work three jobs to get there y'all we're trying to get and network with the right people to get there and god is saying i've already developed it and you would stop going all around the mulberry bush to try to find out how to get to your destiny you don't need certain people with certain resources the problem you don't understand about you is that they need you you keep walking in like you need them but you don't understand and confidence they need you [Applause] i was made for this sometimes you got to remind yourself i was made for this i was made for this when it starts getting weighty and it starts getting heavy and and anxiety starts to sit in and and responsibilities start to become more as the responsibilities start to become more i need to look back at god and saying it's getting a little tight and god says i'm trying to pull something out of you that will develop you enough to get to the destiny that i've set over your life stop crying and quitting everything because it's getting hard and stop running away from the destiny that god has over your life you have got to fit yourself and say i was made for this if you're putting me on my plate guess what i was made for this if you're putting it in my direction guess what i was made for this if you gave me this child guess what i'm made for this [Applause] you just haven't learned you made for it yet so you keep cowarding down and finding ways and excuses and your ways and excuses are moving you further and further from the destiny that god has set over your life and then you're locking in with people who have no purpose and destiny and vision for their own life and so they don't do nothing but complain because they are waking up every morning horrible feeling and and depressed and have no direction but if you get next to somebody that has an awakening of where they're going and then understanding i'm not chasing the world the world is chasing after me why because something on the inside of me that god was making in the secret place as he was developing me and putting me together as he was making me the right height and the right knowledge and everything he was putting together you don't know it was to break strongholds it was to bring deliverance it was to set the kept it free but if you understood it you would walk in it and stop cowering down from the things that the enemy breaks to you i was made for this [Music] [Applause] you don't understand the work that god was doing in my life before he even formed the world and the enemy has been so good at getting us choked up into our past that we stay so far from our future can i tell you today that regardless of how you were conceived you are not an accident [Applause] your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one of them the days that were formed for me when as yet there was none of them pastor what are you saying you're so caught in the conception that you don't see the purpose some of us are so weighted by how we got here that we don't recognize the whole point was just to get us here can i do a therapy session real quick even though i am not a certified clinical therapist so i'm putting it out there let me just do a session real quick if you could overcome the fact that the way in which you came may not be as perfect as you would like it to be but the fact that god was willing to do whatever it took to get you here because the world needed you so bad that even in the most broken conditions of you being in this world that he still got you here and he got you here so you could wreck the world that you're living in today [Applause] sometimes we get so focused on how we get i don't really you know the relationship with me and my you know my mother we you know how the how we do you know my father i don't really the way things worked out because you had parents here's the thing uh my brother and my sister that i want to let you know very quickly clearly is that even though you may not have gotten here and what you perceive is the most perfect way god had you informed you together so well that in the background of it he was pushing everything just to get you on this earth if he could just get you on this earth then he knew that you would change the very foundation of the world and you would not even worry about what god is trying to do in someone else but you would start to discover who you are in jesus christ today who you are is not wrapped up in just your genealogy who you are it's wrapped up in who god says you are who am i in the head and not the tail i am above and not i'm blessed in my going out and my coming in the context behind it is is i was made for this i was formed and created got capacity you don't understand there there are things in my life that i have problems that i can't do and i can't use pastor what about those that are disabled and what about those that that aren't like everyone else i'm here today to let you know that whatever god has called you to accomplish he has put everything inside of you to be able to manifest and do what he's called don't you feel sorry for nobody because i'm everything that god has created and made me to be when you feel sorry for me you lessen the ability of me being able to understand that there's greatness inside of me i don't care if i'm in a wheelchair i don't care if i'm hopping up i don't care if there are areas of my body that don't look like everybody else whatever it is he called me to do is greater than what the body can do within itself anyway god is greater than what this outside body can do i can speak the word and see deliverance i can speak a word and watch yolks fall i can speak the word and have a miracle done here you don't understand it's by my voice it's about my mission it's by what i understand there's greatness on the inside of me i was made for this y'all it doesn't matter what my challenge is i was made for this but the reason that i start to feel sorry for myself it's because i believe is that what's physically happening with me is a limitation to what god wants to do in me and i'm here today to let you know stop looking at the outward because god is doing something on the inward and what he wants to use inwardly is greater than what you could ever do outwardly that's why the enemy is so good at making you focus on your outward because he knows if you can spend more time outwardly you'll spend less time inwardly nothing will grow nothing will develop you be cute are you cucu but the problem is is that you'll still be the 16 year old you who's battling the self-esteem who's living in the anxiety and the depression and who has never come out of themself because they're so hung up on what the outside is saying instead of being hung up on what the holy spirit is saying one of the things that you've got to understand is that what god has done within you is greater than what you could ever imagine or believe the idea behind it is that you don't understand how the inward side works and so inwardly you don't get how well you've been created how well you have been formed how uniquely you have been designed you think you're just a mere flesh and blood with a crazy mind and an emotional trip and you have collected yourself to be simplistic when bible says you are complex here's what i want to let you know is that you must understand point number one that you were created by god's power god's power is omnipotent it is unending it has no limits science cannot understand the totality of the human while it wants to try it cannot because of the complexity of who we are we are not just dirt and emotions we are mind body we are spirit we are soul we are complex if i ask you to define soul you would try to define it but you wouldn't be able to because you would say it's this thing on the inside that i think might be a ghost i'm not sure but it do some weird stuff and when it do some weird stuff i start acting weird and i don't know why it does it but it does it when it wants to and i don't know how to keep control and god's saying that's why you need the holy spirit to get yourself together because you can't control and manipulate something that you never created [Music] yeah you jacked up this morning like i am rain hit you you don't know why you down now you depressed sad i don't even know if i'm gonna go to that welcome home thing why because i don't know i'm just not feeling it together what made you do that three drops of rain you can't explain yourself [Applause] you're too complicated called you last week you was hyped called you this week you in the mall what's wrong with you i don't know i just ain't feeling it today what is going on you need something more than you to regulate yourself because if we won't be honest we crazy we all over the place feeling it one day not feeling it the next day feeling good about a moment not feeling good about a moment feeling great about people not feeling great about people feeling insecure feeling security feeling up feeling down feeling good feeling bad trying to get a hold of our emotions [Applause] but for some reason they seem to be out of control why because you're complex it's not as easy to put you all together we got to say the right stuff in the right tone in the right way don't look at me that way don't say it at that level don't say it like that if you say it like that i get mad you can say it that way just watch your tone oh my god [Applause] it's too much [Applause] it's a lot but created by the power of god it's something greater than what you can feel within yourself and control that's why the bible says we need a comforter a holy spirit to be on the inside of you and say just calm it down it's gonna be okay i'm out of here i'm not doing this no more i'm sick of it wait wait what why because something within has greater power than i have the ability to control what i feel what i desire what i want who i want the way i want now i make it a part of me and god says um i infilled you with the holy spirit as you came to know me so that it can be that in which guides you and leads you into the truth that you need but what we're not out here doing is running rampant on how we feel and what we believe because there is a word that already sets the standard for who we are and where we're going and what we're doing and so we have to be able to say i need something to regulate where i am because i cannot regulate it of myself why because i am so complex and i cannot trust me anybody ever been there before hey y'all can't trust me i'm up here smiling 10 minutes be somewhere crying in the corner what's wrong with you i don't know you got together pastor though i don't know fine somebody do something you know that's so no you're like man you complex yeah he was working on a lot of parts of me in the secret place he was uniquely designing me he was putting pieces together that were a part of my my attitude in the way in which i do humor and the way in which i see and and the complexity of the way in which i i laugh and and you find it as a default but the truth of the matter is it's who i am and so what the holy spirit is doing is saying no i'm just going to leave you where you are but i love you too much to leave you where you are i'm coming back after you so we can form that and frame it into the right way so that it can be used for my glory that's what the framing is that's why we don't get to say what is and what isn't that's why we don't get to put people in hell or heaven we just have to put them back to the scripture hey this is this is what paul wrote this is what timothy wrote this is what the apostles wrote go back and check out their testimony of what jesus is saying because if you can check that testimony out you'll find yourself in a different place and you're saying that's not you pastor marcus i'll be like i told you that you've been mad at me for 17 years for something that's been written in the bible and you thought it was me and i've been trying to tell you it's what the testimony of those in whom god gave the inspired work to have been speaking all along [Applause] verse 13 it says this for you were formed you formed my inward parts you knitted me together in my mother's womb you're knitted together anybody know about knitting knitting takes a long time a lot of patience he's just sitting there just what you doing was that a a mitten is that a what you got what are you putting together what is that is that a glove is that a potholder because the idea is that your most simplistic state people cannot see the immense potential that's inside of you that is so great that what people see in you they will lower it to what they can see within themselves you must be admitting because that's all i am you must be a pot holder because that's that's that's as far as i've gotten you must be it's like no no no i'm actually a full cover for king size plus bed [Applause] but i'm being knitted together and you can't see it right now because you're looking at me by what i wear and you're looking at me by the way i'm talking you're looking at me by my past and you're looking at me by my mistakes that are on the outside and you're looking but as he keeps knitting me together and as you keep seeing the full thing you're gonna understand i'm banging and i cost a lot of money because i'm an original [Music] [Applause] because y'all know when that thing handmade they charge you extra it's gonna be three grand three grand it's an original why do you cost so much why are you so pricey because i'm an original i was made to do what i'm doing you can't find nobody else to do what i do you can find somebody that does what i do the way they do it but for what you want from me i was made for this [Applause] y'all are scared of yourself i've never seen so many people scared of themselves anybody know quickly real quick if you ever go back to the gospels and just reading them real quick jesus was the most humble man yet he was the most confident because all he said was i am you know i'm the way excuse me jesus of nazareth you know i'm the son of god right excuse me all right you know you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood what is going on here there's no humility jesus says i know who i am because the father has given me purpose stop apologizing for purpose stop allowing people to make you feel bad because you have direction i see it all the time somebody won't make you feel bad because you got a standard that you want to live by in your life but they don't have that same standard so they call you being dramatic you know you over doing it you know you're doing a lot you know you can use a lot right now no i was made for this i'm sorry you don't understand your standard yet because you haven't been connected to the father that gives you direction about where you're going so you'll settle for whatever you get whoever offers it whenever they want to offer it forgive me and when they give me the job you understand what i'm saying and i reject it why'd you reject it oh that job's not for me i was made for something else [Music] now don't you non-knowing purpose people try that cause you're gonna need that job you ain't got the faith to be rejecting jobs at the moment but when you know who god says you are you know where to walk in hey so i'm really not qualified for this but i honestly know god given me that job so listen i'm gonna put my application here i'm just gonna slide it on to you when you're ready you call me all right [Applause] we don't know the difference between false humility and the confirmation of what god has spoken and so we revel in the place of saying no no no not me well you should be saying yes yes yes that's what he created me for here's the only time you're rejecting it is when it's not for you you know that what's that is that here you go pastor no i'm good i don't need that that's not for me hey you want to come over here no no i'm good i don't need that that's not for me hey pastor you want this yup that's me go ahead give it to me all of it don't don't short me one bit why because i know what he's offering what he's saying to me you can walk in confidence when you believe and understand what god has spoken stop allowing people to put you in the place that when you spent time with god and they don't know where they're going or what they're doing that they're pressing that off on you no i know where i'm going i know what i'm doing i know where we're going next i know what it looks like pastor do you have any of the resources not a one [Applause] but i know what he spoke the question today is can you believe what god has spoken over your life will you only believe to trust in what you can see because what you can see is limiting where you're going i believe today that we've been created by god's power point number two well actually no i want to read this scripture ephesians 2 and 10. i know i love the scripture it's probably like my favorite scripture i do youth ministry off of this scripture and it says this in an amplified version it says we are his workmanship his own master work a work of art i'm a w.o.a i'm a work of art created in christ jesus reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed ready to be used for good works which god prepared for us before hand taking paths which he set so that we would walk in them living the good life which he pre-arranged and made ready for us it's pre-arranged y'all it's already done it's already completed it's already where it's supposed to be we are his work men ship we are woa we a work of art married couples i want to tell you that people are in relationships when somebody starts getting at you and they tell you you think you all that that's right i am a w.o.a what you say to me that's right i am a woo so whoa over here what are you i'm a work of art i'm complex i'm unique i'm created differently my mind thinks differently i'm sorry that you have to work at conversation with me because the way of way god has created and form me but what i'm not going to do is reduce who i am to fit who you are because you don't want to do the work and i've done it all right moving on point number two [Applause] we're created under god's creation in verse 13 it says this my friend was hidden from you when i was being made in secret intricately woven in the depths of the earth you were under god's inspection anybody know about that inspection you see that inspection certificate that's on the meat that's on the product that says this has been inspected some of us know it really hasn't been inspected when you look at that machine and that machine stamps it down it's upside down with the date is wrong it's all inspections not even spelled right you're just like this was not inspected but it says we were we were inspected before we went out we were inspected before we were created we were inspected before we were born it says my frame was not hidden from you you know in the frame of the body there is 206 bones that frames who you are that keeps us moving day by day it says i i've framed you i know how you're constructed not just the physical but i know how your mind is i know how your head is i know the way that you are i know the proclivities that you have i know the way that you tend to think i know your frame i know how you're created i want to tell you today because you came from god and share his essence and components your value and potential are known to him and him alone throughout the history of mankind god has sought to overcome the blindness that sin has brought to our lives he watches with sadness as his creations discount their potential and doubt their worth god's willingness to send jesus to die for our sins is proof of how much we are worth what happened on the cross is proof of how much you're worth what happened on the cross jesus was crucified a horrible death after that horrible death he was buried in the grave with no one believing that he would rise but the bible says on the third day he rose with all power in his hand and he did it for you tell your neighbor that was for you [Music] that was for you he didn't do it for himself he did it for you and the last point i want to give to you point number three is that you must understand that you were created according to god's design i just want you real quick just take a look at yourself just start looking at you and i want you to smile while you look at you look at this look at this yeah all of this yep oscar created according to his design made in his image in his likeness i love it i love it i love it looks great wonderful amazing sometimes the problem is we're looking for too many people to tell us what god has already said so now you compromise who you are so that you can get the compliment that you never spoke to yourself you got to wait look man god you did a work i'm trying to tell you you got to go back to psalms 139 how long were you in the secret place for me because it probably took you a long time i know i i mean you did the earth in a week but i know i took about two some of y'all like no man that's not right you can't play with the lord i am uniquely i am a work of art i am when you keep suppressing the greatness of who god has created you to be you don't get to see the full potential of what he's saying verse 16 says this your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one of them every day has already been planned out for you you don't have to work at thinking about it you don't have to work so hard at trying to be the one that comes up with the resources he says it's already been created it's already done tell your neighbor it's already done you were made for what's already done he could not make you for something that he did not have an into [Music] have you ever thought about that why did he create me the way that he did because he knew the ending first you don't create something without having an idea where it's going like we're going to create a i don't know put a wood up and put something there sir that's the table we know what we're creating we're creating a table now the design is specific to the end result he created you knowing the in already in mind he's not figuring it out as you go you're created with your height your way your eyes this very dynamic way of where you are because he had a specific design for you pastor what happens with all those that have dealt with illnesses that is the brokenness of the sin of this world john 16 33 tells us in this life you will have trouble but take heart i've overcome the world it doesn't all end here it doesn't all stop at this moment i am for you that's why you can't be so pulled into this world and thinking that your job is the everything that's going to keep you god says you were not created for a job you were created for a purpose [Music]
