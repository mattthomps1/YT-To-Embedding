foreign we're going to jump right into the word of God now this is scripture context of a man by the name of Moses who was a deliverer of God's people and he delivered them out of bondage because God had called them but this season that we find Moses in is a is a season that many of us are often in it's a season where where Moses ran from the issues and problems of life to himself if I can distance myself anybody ever felt like that before if I could just get away if I could just distance myself from the problems things would get better but here's the thing I want to let you know is that what God has purpose and set over your life you cannot run away from when we pick up Moses in chapter 3 verse 1 it says now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro the priest dominion and he led his flock to the west side of the Wilderness Moses had no business being in the west side [Music] the anointing is on the east side not the west side the Bible already speaks it [Applause] this I'm telling you this scripture for everything be careful West Side people he said he let us flock to the west side of the Wilderness and he came to whoreb the Mountain of God I said in the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame a fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold the Bush was burning yet it was not consumed only God can do that I said and Moses said I will turn aside to see this great sight I love how Moses expressed his feelings of what he was going to do through words anybody ever seen somebody say that I'm laughing and you're like why are you telling me won't you just laugh that's what happened right here Moses said I'll turn to the side I said Moses just turned to the side and go ahead and take a look he said he said I will turn aside to see this great sight why the bush is not burned when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God Called to him out of the Bush Moses Moses and he said here I am ah here I am and he said do not come near take your sandals off your feet for the place on which you are standing is Holy Ground and he said I am the god of your father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look at God then the Lord said I have surely seen your affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their task Masters I know their sufferings and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land to a good and Broad land a land flowing with milk and honey to the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the parasites the hivites and the jebusites and Now Behold The Cry of the people of Israel has come to me and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them and if you had a Bible I would love you to underline this one word he said come I will sing you to pharaoh that you may bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt but Moses said to God who am I that I should go to pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt he said meaning God but I will be with you [Music] and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you when you have brought the people out of Egypt You Shall Serve God on this mountain I want to come from the title on our first week of this [Music] you can can we pray father in the name of Jesus we declare today that your word will stand on a short ground let the seed that is sown today let it not fall on Stony ground let it not fall into shallow soil but let it go deep into the hearts so that we would not just only be hearers of your word but also doers in Jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much amazing musicians y'all can y'all help me give it up for our Dream Team day come on help me celebrate them in this place [Applause] thinking about when I was young and when I was young I I remember playing in what is called an alley now some of you I want to let you know is that my younger Crow we went outside a lot at my age there was there was not a lot of opportunity to sit in the home we had this this thing called outside and outside produced these opportunities of growth and as well as fresh air so that we could get out of our parents hair it was the thing that watched you while you left your parents alone outside was the place where Community was together and people felt comfortable enough to send their kids outside it and so we would get outside and we would play there were so many gains that we would Avail ourselves to I don't know if you've ever seen a a milk crate but we used to play basketball with a milk crate we would we would take the bottom out and we would we would that's where all your engineers came from you're trying to figure out we we cut the bottom of a crate out and and we would attach it to a fence but it couldn't be too high because everybody that was small wanted to know how to dunk and so we would we would attach the crate to the fence and we would play basketball and and and and and and we would play hide and seek but one of the best games that we played was tag anybody remember tag tag was the game where you had to be quick you had to make sure that as people were moving and and going about and and they would literally mock you as you were trying to catch them you would have to stay away so the person did not touch you it went a little bit like this you would begin to set the boundary of how far people could go and and then you had to find the person who was going to be it now if you really understand how this goes when when it came to it that means that everybody had to be in a circle and to determine who was going to be it it required a very strategic plan of calculating statistically who would be it one of the best statistical ways to find who would be it was through any meaning my Nemo there was nothing like any mini-money mo everybody would put their foot in and you would just put their foot out and you would go any mini-monimo catcher and you would just go at it and everybody be looking praying that's when your prayer life started because you didn't want to be it father right now in the name of Jesus I asked that we did not land on me in Jesus name and there was eeny meeny miny moe but then that was the second one it was a look it was a little it was a little risque now I'm gonna tell you it's a little it's a little hoodish and it was my mother and your mother we're hanging up close my mother sucks your mother right dead in the nose what color was the blood [Applause] what kind of violin game is this but out of all of the games the best one the most strategic one the most one that was cutting edge ever to come out in this world especially when you have been chosen to be the one who picks was cut sausage out anybody remember cut sausage out it was a very strategic way to get yourself out and to get your friends out but the person who wasn't necessarily in the club that's how you got them to be it and everybody would put their foot in every real quick cut sausage out no you only needed three to get to you cut sausage out cuts on any what's left was the person that was it when you were it it means that you you had to wait and count y'all you know how you were doing 5 10 15 20 you listen math was important back then if you could not count by fives trying to tell you you were counting and you would get it there and then and then and then the person would give that last number and they would search for the people that they could find the strategy would be to find the slowest person and catch them because if you caught them that means they became what it is crazy we would be dodging people we would be in there just talking about you can't get me we've been making all kinds of moves and dancing shaking people before there was any basketball shaking you were shaking people up on the playground playing tag and you were doing everything so that you wouldn't be caught it's funny that I wonder if we heard God's opinion would it oftentimes feel like he's playing tag with us I wonder how many times God has tried to call you but you've been in the game of dodging your purpose and potential and you've been playing tag with God the whole time you've been oops nope you didn't catch me this time oops no that's not it and you would move out the way just so that God wouldn't catch you because if God caught you it means that you would have the responsibility to fulfill your purpose and the thing that we know about purpose is that purpose is going to cost me something purpose puts me in position it puts me in a position to live out what God's called me to live or I can stay not being it and avoid the conflict of looking Within Myself and challenging myself to see that there's more inside of me than I've ever known the idea that scripture lets us know that we're in this positional place where Moses finds himself in Midian and the Bible's like Moses is a Midian he's enjoying life he has now a wife and two kids but the issue of it is is that Moses has left a life behind that prepared him for what God had in store for him Moses had what's called a burning bush moment there are three things that happen when when God connected and Called Moses there's this bush it's burning I don't know if you're like me but I would have been Moses I would have been taking some sheep with me walking and feeling good airpods in my ear just enjoying God loving some worship music doing what I like to do in the comfort of Life all of a sudden I look out the side of my eye and there is a bush that's on fire but not on fire and it's burning but it's not being consumed I see all the leaves I see the fruit that it's bearing and nothing is being affected but it's yet burning it can't help but catch my attention as I Look to I think I'm looking and if there's nobody there with me I'm probably looking at the sheep saying to myself do you see what I see there's a bush that's burning because God's trying to get my attention how many things in your life have been burning and you sorting a peripheral but you said if I go over there and I try to help it look at it or do something about it it's going to take more energy for me to address it than it would be for me to leave it alone oh it'd be so easy burning bush nope I'm going this way that's almost in Seattle I don't I don't need anybody ever been there before I don't I don't need this today have you what God is and tugging at you you find that you're like not today pick another week pick another day pick up but not today I can do without a burning bush day I got enough going on anybody ever said that before I got enough going on my life is consumed with enough I don't need this now I don't need to be in this place now and God is trying to get your attention and you know it but the problem is is you're just like ah not no that's we're not going back to that sometimes you're even saying to God you're doing too much God you you really how many people gonna text me today telling me I was praying for you we're doing too much God how many people are interrupt me trying to do what I do on the normal how many people keep I'm trying to do me and it keeps getting interrupted because God has a burning bush moment happening in my life and I keep trying to ignore it but the truth of the matter is I can't ignore it because I just know it's him after me Pastor how do I know I'm having a burning bush moment one of the first things that you have to know is that God will identify himself Moses it's me well well how do I know you have given God access to your life when you came to know him when you came to know him you said Lord I want to be available even though you didn't know but you said it he was like I want to be available to you and God was like and I'm available on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 2 p.m and 3 P.M Mountain Standard Time you're like God I I want to be available to you I want to deal with you I want to do it but listen my schedule anybody know you and God and your schedule it's a little tight anybody ever been there with god listen I work today so if we could do this I would join that build of fire here's the problem I've got a long evening so if I don't get that 30 minutes at the top it could mess my whole day so God if you could move build a fire up to like 10 o'clock I'll be great anybody gotta start bargaining with it's like God's like hey I wanna I'm ready for you like wait this doesn't fit in in my time frame God and God says but it's me and you're saying well how do I know it's you because you were in his word you you heard the power of the Holy Spirit speak you you heard somebody come to you and say you're on the right Road you're in the right direction and you're saying well how do I know it's God and God said I made myself known as clear as possible I'm calling you I'm reaching out to you and and then God identifies himself but he doesn't just stay there God shares his purpose Moses my people are in bondage I've heard their Affliction and I need you I'm telling you come and deliver my people imma say this to you today God gives you purpose some of you are asking what am I supposed to be doing you're supposed to be impacting the world God's called you and you're like I don't I don't want to do that for everybody what about just me I want to do it in my circle my group of people my I want to do it there and God says no I've called you to a city I've called you to a community I've called you to a family I've called you to a nation I've called you to the world and you're like can't we just be called to our house that's a lot it's a lot of extra it's a lot to be doing and then God has the nerve to give you Direction go what do you mean go go stop change move you like now today me oh I'm not set up for that guy Moses immediately deflects come here's why that's important the Bible says he says come God tells him come come as what a what command anybody ever told your children come here and what they do and look at you right come here come you're you're breaking the phrases up you're reorganizing the phrases you're you're trying to get them to understand the I said come you're you're dragging out the word come here you're describing it you're breaking and you're like come and they're looking at you like no [Applause] you you pointing it's nobody else you come here now to eventually what you got to go get them you little if we wasn't in public this has come but Moses takes God's command as a suggestion have you taken God what he's saying over your life as a suggestion come to me all ye who are heavy laden and I'll give you rest and now I'm good on the whole rest thing I'll wear it out myself he's like come come come I've got something for you today God is calling you come there is a command I am giving you because I'm leading you into purpose and Direction here's how I want to help you understand you have unfinished business but you are saying to God catch me if you can oops nope you didn't get me well no not that time I avoided it oh no I heard what they said but it wasn't me that time oh snow you were talking to my best friend not me God I can't imagine that God is trying to connect us to his purpose and we are left feeling like we're all alone I'm crazy enough to believe God is saying I want to do that but in your life today I'm trying to figure out where has God said to you today in your life come and you said no God I'm good I'm good anybody good like I'm good and I was like well why do we stay where we are anybody ever asked that question before you ever asked yourself that question why can't I change why can't I I wonder for anybody upset I want to forgive but I can't as if there's somebody else in control I want to love them I just can well what's keeping you something on the inside are you out of control of your inside do you not have control of you because when you make the statement that's what you say you say I'm no longer in control of me so there are only two things that can be in control of you the spirit of God [Applause] [Music] I want to I can't you can you choose not to Let's understand the difference choosing the option somebody say option the option to not flow in God's command what's one of the reasons that we don't live out what God's called for us to live out first point trauma trauma trauma impacts our lives so much we don't even understand how much it hits us some of us have grown up in trauma living out trauma and we have normalized it some of us have found ourselves in a place a trip you're like I grew up in a great home it was a great home that you were neglected love you had every asset but you didn't have what you truly needed you you were growing up in a home that provided or you were growing up in a place where it gave you what you needed from a material standpoint but left you empty for love so you went searching for love in all the wrong places some of us are dealing with trauma out of our household can I can I say this to you for real some of us are dealing with trauma because we never learn how to be honest about where we are some of you are still living out your parents dream because you're too scared to think about what it would be like to actually live out who God called you to be and not what they told you you should be so now you're living from a perspective of trauma some of you have abuse trauma some of you have trauma that's from your absentee parent some of us are living out trauma so here's what we say to ourselves there is no way that I'm going to live a life with God when I can't even trust the normal person in my life there's a trauma that's missing there's a trauma that's happening there's an area in your life that you have blocked off you're like I'm not doing that anybody ever been there I got church hurt I'm not going back to church church and God not the same thing but we will make any excuse possible to make sure that we can escape God's come so we don't have to be putting ourselves in a place where it's like God says I want you to come here and we're just looking at God like this no come no here no now no but here's my prayer God blessed me indeed enlarge my territory give me a job give me a place and God's like so you want me to do for you without you being obedient to what I've called you to do you want there to be an invalid exchange you want me to bless you where I can't bless you because you're actually not operating in the blessing territory so the will that I've already declared that is being done in heaven cannot even happen here on Earth because there's a disconnect between you and I now we don't know the difference between blessings and curses because as long as it feeds what I want when oftentimes what I want is connected to the trauma of where I live out of so the trauma that I live out of is so continuous in my life that I've normalized the trauma and the broken places from my past that I'm saying to myself today this is actually a normal way of living this normal way of living puts me in the category to justify me not living out my purpose so I will live a life that is worried about getting things to the place I want them to be instead of fulfilling the call of God on my life so I have a place of Unfinished Business what am I walking around satisfying the desires of the flesh I want to make sure I feel good I want to make sure I do what I want to do I want to make sure it's the amount of money I want to make it's the job where I want to be it's the thing I want to do and the problem is is that trauma keeps me from being obedient because obedience in my life was always an impact of someone doing something against me that I did didn't like so now trauma is my new normal and now I cover it up through my words like well you know I don't like people well some of your trauma doesn't have you close to people because you haven't really experienced love properly a love child and a love individual has the ability to give back love because that means they've been filled and taught and given the ability to understand how it works what we have done is really put to our Brokenness and excuse and so the trauma we live out from church hurt from household some of us are dealing with the trauma of being adopted or foster care and we have lost the place where we don't have an identity anymore and so now you're trying to define it look at my life I'm like hey what's going on yeah yeah yeah hey you want to do this no I don't do that why I don't even have a reason for why can I can I tell you for everything you say you don't do tell me what's its origin why don't you do people because of what your emotions is what what's attached we love to excuse our lives without reason oh this is just how I am it's not how you are Romans 12 and 2 says therefore be not conformed to the pattern of this world but be you what by the what renewing renewing means not a new mind A Renewed mind which means it has to already have been there it's just been clouded in shape and the Bible says in what iniquity in sin and Brokenness so my Concepts now the way I live I live so I watch and I brag about it they ain't catch me this time I didn't fulfill my purpose this time it's like yep I know you're empty and you're trying to decide what God looks like I want to tell you this real quick you don't have to live out of your trauma and you don't have to live in an unfulfilled life because you don't understand and true Clarity that God has called you can you just tell your neighbor real quick God's called you we have gotten so used to being sad and feeling broken that we have pacified our Brokenness and we like it anyone really from Baltimore you're not because you raised your hand anybody from Baltimore there we go that's where you're from would you ever lift your hand again with no tea in there one of the cultures of Baltimore is is that when we see each other one of the biggest things that you'll get is maybe a head nod but the culture in Baltimore is you do not talk to each other you got to have a neighborhood community you you gotta have a whole society that has worked over time to build communication and you'll be like man it's that church it's not the church that's all they do you walk right past them I mean and look you in the eye he'd be like are you gonna say huh and then when you get right can can I can I tell somebody when you get the boldness to speak the person on the other side is so traumatized they don't even know what to do like hey how you doing hey you be like what what now if from another state and you have a friendly State you feel offended by Baltimore [Applause] you come in and say immediately what is wrong with this city nobody speaks everybody looks angry the mean face is the norm this is the look can y'all imagine I want you to get in my seat real quick right imagine standing up here with a Baltimore Church do you know what it looks like when I say let's worship God together hallelujah oh okay okay well well that was I want a little bit more drastic than I thought it should have that was that was a little harder than I thought it should have went that was hard you can we can we talk about this for five seconds real quick I want us to be the kindest Church in Baltimore [Applause] cause the way you look says say one thing to me [Applause] right now like I'm not breaking I won't break this is not a contest y'all I'm just I'm trying to look at your neighbor real quick just look at them this scared you didn't it they look like they was about to do something to you [Applause] because we have adopted [Music] look as resistant as you can because that's your protection so when it comes to God we already have a facade on that says don't even come this way I don't even I don't even have time for some of us the face we have on our face is the face we have on our hearts that's how we live you think you no I can't don't even go there oh okay oh we're right hey hey okay and our trauma has Justified us being the way that we are and so we stay there and so we say let's build a church with a mix of people coming together to change lives change the world no I don't like them they don't like me because the trauma in our heart says is that in order to be renewed I can only be renewed with people like me and so trauma Keeps Us from hearing God's voice the scripture says clearly in John 16 33 it says this I've told you all this so that trusting me you will be unshakable and assured deeply at peace it tells you what you've grown up in it speaks to the present World we're in it says in this Godless world you will continue to experience difficulties but don't let it change you it says take heart [Applause] I've conquered the world [Applause] some of us live out of the trauma as if he has not already caught we live as if it's already condemned and doomed and we're broken and this abundant life that God is calling us to we have no ability I am trying to tell you real quick I'm not trying to force you into a feel good I'm trying to tell you what you're reflecting outside is a posture of your heart it's the posture of trauma it's the posture of being in the same mindset for so long that the way you live out your life is through a broken filter I'm hurt so I'm gonna act hurt I've been damaged so I'm gonna damage other people so forgiveness isn't an option for you and here's the best way to blame it well you know that was the kind of house I grew up in Roman says you can't stay where you are when you get connected to God it doesn't matter about your household you are a part of a new household it is the household of the Faith of Christ Sons and Daughters of Jesus Christ so how can you say you are his but you're not shaped in him [Applause] you're a Christian not a follower [Applause] and you've let trauma be your reasoning for why you don't do the second thing that keeps us in this game of Catch Me If You Can is the opinion and the idea that I want to stay in Comfort somebody say Comfort man I love listen here I love some comfort when I fly Delta I try to look for Comfort plus you understand what I'm saying I'm not just looking for Comfort I'm looking for Comfort plus y'all that's Comfort Beyond [Music] anybody like a comfortable life all right don't be lying in here now y'all no no Pastor I'm here I like comfortable I like comfortable sheets I like comfortable linen I like I like comfort we are so comfortable that when you walk in your home some of you have that that thermostat that when it sees you coming in it changes the temperature as soon as you get in the house you walk past and be like you know what to do here come on Vince open up lights come on some of you talking to your house your house is like good to see you today God bless you like this is Comfort I ain't touched nothing I ain't put my hand on nothing I done spoke I told Alexa what to do that's how comfortable we are I don't even I'm so high and mighty I don't even deal with my house I have a representative Alexa turn it on you know what to do some of you don't program Alexa to call you sire [Laughter] yes your majesty what what in the world is this [Applause] we love comfort and we brag about comfort I don't want to do any more than what I have to do I want to go any further than where I gotta go I want to do any more than what I have to do some of us we grew up in a house that was so comfortable that we have picture comfort without purpose can can I tell you you grew up somewhere where it was so comfortable that you saw your parents just chilling good you might have not have seen nobody go after purpose but you understood all I want to do is just go home and anybody can say and be comfortable at the church you know what you got lined up we going to brunch and then we got a Sunday night [Applause] we already got lined up I'll be like what you doing at three now help me you hear me now [Applause] so what we have done in a culture right now is we've misappropriated self-care and we're using self-care as an option for us not to have to bear our cross so we say you know what it's about I need to take care of me it's not even biblical for you to say that out of your mouth we just got off of John 16 33. I don't want stress in my life I don't want stress I'm not gonna have no anxiety I need to live in peace my energy is important to me you're who my energy where does it say God cares two cents about your energy because you don't understand I'm a Virgo if you knew how Virgos are what's a Virgo it's a month that doesn't even make sense how was a sign a month it has an origin and the origin is not the origin you think it is to identify your characteristics because of when you were born your characteristics were defined it doesn't matter when you were born God had already declared who you are but you got to read a Bible to know that [Applause] you got to understand I was created in my mother's womb I gotta understand I was uniquely created the reason you are the way you are is not because of your sign it's because of your creator [Applause] I hear you somebody y'all don't applies for me [Laughter] but that's why we gotta build a fire because I need Christians to pick up a Bible because we're quoting things we have no Clarity on and we are following a culture in a world that's telling us anything and yet if it's telling us so much to help us why do you feel less and less fulfilled foreign we just had some basic levels if you can tell who you are and where you're going by your sign then why aren't you on course [Music] I was just asking because you know you were Sagittarius you can't even spell Sagittarius SS essay Sagittarius you know what I'm talking about many of us are living in comfort and we are excusing our comfort because we don't want the weight of our purpose and your purpose is calling for you it's it's calling after you you're like I just want to go home and be fine and God's like I get it but what I did not do is set you up in this life with your blessings so that your end result can be you going home and leaving a world broken can I oh can I say something real quick what if you wrestle with detention that every day wasn't going to be a comfortable day foreign the Bible did not call us to comfort it called us to follow after him this is what the scripture says I'm just going to give you Bible and you can do whatever what you want but here's the Bible Matthew 16 24 Jesus very words then Jesus said to his disciples if anyone wishes to follow me as my disciple he must or she must deny himself or herself and set aside sell fish interests and take up his or her cross expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come and follow me believing in me conforming to my example in living and if need be suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in me maybe I tricked you seven years ago can we leave that scripture up tricked you maybe maybe God gave you this understanding that coming to Jesus was about you fulfilling it the way you want to fulfill it and how you want to fulfill it and you've got this picture picture perfect idea that whatever Society has told you is the way to do it you've adapted that's the way I'll do it the problem is is that the Bible tells us is that there's a cross you have to carry ask your neighbor real quick where's your cross where's your cross oh no I put that down I put that down about three miles ago that thing was too heavy I'm not playing with that cross got me all tired because everything says there is supposed to be this equal balance of living where you are never tired you are never worried you are never in a place of thought you should never be stressed people would never treat you this way so you have created so many barriers around you to be able to keep yourself from experiencing anything outside of discomfort that all you say is I want to live in Comfort but then you don't go look at the Bible in Matthew chapter 16 because you're a theologian doing devotions but in your Theologian devotion time God's not opening up any word word is not for you to have information word is for transformation I want to tell you that today if you're reading it but you're not being transformed then there's something that's not happening in the renewing of your mind you need to go back and say Lord I feel a little light over here where's my cross because he said if you wish to follow me you got to take up your cross follow me and then the last point I want to give you is the reason what keeps us away and keeps us in the game let's capture me if you can it's inadequacy some of us feel like we just don't measure up I just Jesus is saying come I mean you're like Moses who am I that you should send me who who am I that I should go to pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt some of you have constantly been saying who am I [Music] you are everything that God needs you're more than enough you are the head and not the tail you're above and not beneath you're a blessing you're going out and you're coming in you're everything that God is looking for pastor I have not gotten it all together he never asked you to get it together because you could never get it together you got trauma you got areas of comfort that you've been striving for and still have yet to get you've got more money than you could ever imagine you had you had as many houses and as many cars and yet you're still unfulfilled you've got a savings account that's saying you are everything you are on financial point and the problem is is you're still empty me it's a it's a sense of inadequacy can I say this to you you are inadequate and so am I but he uses inadequate people that's what makes us the same he's not going around hand-picking and saying you know what no not you because I don't like the way you really talk and look like no let me go with her and let me look at no he says every one of you I place a purpose over everyone of your life I have put a calling over your life I see you more than you can see yourself and you're saying God you don't really know my past you don't know where I came from you don't know the stuff that I've done you don't even know about my person you don't know about where I was you don't know about my mindset God said I want you exactly for that I want you for your Brokenness I want you for your mouth I want you for your impatience why because I want to show the world I can use anybody to change the world [Music] yes I am inadequate I never forget growing up my sister and I she was the one who could talk to anybody my sister could have everybody from the neighborhood they'd be at the gate and you know me I just be sitting on the side like hey how y'all doing yeah [Music] because I took on the idea that God hadn't called me to people I lived out there yeah well never never anybody ever said never anybody have been there before never no I'm not nope some of you some of you who are members took the spiritual gifts assessment that thing said pastor you dropped that pin so fast and left out that growth track room so quick I think said pastor you was like oh no no not here not me Moses said do you know I can't really speak well I don't really I don't like the stage I don't really like all these moments and components I can't really do it in God's sight I don't need you to do it I'm doing it in you so you have everything you need just tell your neighbor real quick you got everything you need tell your other neighbor you've got everything you need tell your dirt or say their choice you got everything you need everything you need right now for what God's calling for you to do today now to fulfill the purpose he's called over your life stop waiting to try to get yourself together you ain't got yourself together already then stop worrying about say God I'm coming just as I am all messed up all broken and locked and King all stressed out with anxiety I'm coming just like this if you want me then change me if you want me then deliver me if you want me then Set Me Free but I can't do it of myself [Applause] yeah that's why he said Come Just As You Are stop fronting for everybody else let's live like we've got it all together we do nods there are moments in my life where I'm sitting there pondering everything I'm quitting today I'm leaving town I'm getting on a flight I'm going somewhere where you can't find me and then you see me on Sunday like he's got the joy of the Lord but 20 minutes before I was on a plane it's not because it was easy anybody God did not call me to live out his purpose conveniently right at the appointed time when I need to once I made sure anybody worked like this once I make sure everything's in order [Music] come here you're inadequate yeah you don't know all the scripture here you don't know what to do but he said I didn't ask you to do that he said if you ask shall receive if you seek you will find and if you knock the door will be open God I don't know you like I should know you but I want you to do something he's like perfect you already asked me perfect that's the first start then he starts putting things in front of you once you go to that and I'll make this available and I'm gonna put this person in your life and it's like seek me yeah and you'll find me and he's like well what do you want me to do with it and then somebody comes to you and says hey won't you do this here's the first thing we say let me get back to you [Music] can we stop playing tag with God today can we offer ourselves the Bible says what as a living sacrifice a living sacrifice now to him now to him not future credit not to come credit but now to him who is Abel to carry out his purpose and to do super abundantly more than all you even dare ask or think infinitely beyond our greatest prayers hopes and dreams according to his power that is at work within who he is able he is able [Music] right where you are he is able [Music] right where you sit he is able right where you stand he is able I dare you try him I dare you trust him and let him finish the work he is already started the word of God lets us know that he who have begun a good work ciao perform it
