[Music] God is speaking and I don't want to miss what God is saying to me I don't want to miss what God is saying to his people so we want to get connected the first scripture we're going to come from is Zechariah Chapter 9. Zechariah Chapter 9. and we're going to start at verse 9. and here's what it reads it says Shout and cheer daughter Zion says raise your voice daughter Jerusalem your king is coming a good King who makes all things right a humble King riding a donkey a mere coat of a donkey we're gonna jump to John chapter 12. and we're going to start at verse 12 and here's what it says and it says the next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem so they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him crying whole Santa blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord even the king of Israel and Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written fear not Daughter of Zion behold your King is Coming sitting on a donkey's cold and his disciples did not understand these things at first but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the Tomb and raised them from the dead continued to Bear witness Verse 18 the reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign so the Pharisees said to one another you see that you are gaining nothing look the world has gone after him I want to come from the title today a Prisoner of Hope a Prisoner of Hope can we pray today Father in the name of Jesus we believe today that you would allow for us to have this moment with you that we would not only be hearers of your word but that we would be doers of your word I pray today that our hearts would be available to receive whatever it is that you want to say for we love you we honor and we thank you in Jesus name can somebody say Amen amen God bless you musicians thank you so much listen can you help me give it up for our Dream Team that's in the building every volunteer that's a part can you help me celebrate them amen I was thinking about this idea Palm Sunday I was I was thinking about in reference to uh what what is Palm Sunday and why is it uh a reference point for us what is the purpose of Palm Sunday anybody ever went to the point and think about what what is Palm Sunday benefit me today I I understand that after church we're gonna get some palms and some of you will take pawns and you say I got to take one for my mother and take one for my uncle you start naming all the people you got to get palms for and here's the thing we're not going to keep you from getting Palms because we have a lot of Palms so take them but I I thought about what is the benefit of us recognizing Palm Sunday today and I said to myself why would we celebrate this moment why would we give ear an opportunity to to this space and and I started to think about it when I was young we would get the palms and then if I don't know you're about me even though I was a PK kid I had a little bit of uh of a way of my life where I would I would put people in position I would use the Palm I would I would mess with people I'd take the palm and and try to mess with somebody in the back of their head I would take the palm and and smack somebody in the back of their head with it I was I was a little unruly I would try to get out but there was this reason that I had the palm and I didn't understand what the reasoning was anybody ever been in a place where you traditionally were doing things in your life but you don't understand why you're doing them anybody ever been at a place in their life where where you understand hey I know what we're doing and I know we do this year after year but what's the reasoning and and I started to ask the Lord what is the reason that we're going to celebrate Palm Sunday what is the reason I understood that you came in I understood that that that they they presented you Hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord but I said what is the purpose of celebrating Palm Sunday and the Lord began to say to me is because Palm Sunday is a declaration that I'm a God that keeps my promise I looked and I begin to Define and understand that when the scripture was written in Zechariah Chapter 9. and then we go into Malachi there's a space between the Old Testament and the New Testament that's called The Silent years and the Bible says in the silent years God was silent to his people and the Bible tells us that year span was about 400 years anybody could imagine praying to God in the Lord not even answering your prayer for 10 minutes can you imagine being in a place in your life where things are going out of control where you feel like you are under the burden and under the the the pressure of life and the Lord is silent on you can you imagine being in the place today where you are praying for God to move in the most perfect way but the Lord is silent on you anybody don't like a silent God when the scripture says we're coming boldly before the throne of grace where we may obtain help in the time of need I need God to say something I need God to speak something I need God to let me know he's listening and he is about what I am saying but anybody can imagine 400 years of quietness my wife and I anytime we we might get into a a a an argument the best I got with silent time is about two days two days before I crack and start saying something you're not gonna say nothing to me well you didn't say anything to me am I trying to break the Silence with the moment of asking a question what well what do you want to eat or or where you want to go you want to do something but can you imagine that you are in one of the most distressful times of your life and the Lord is silent 400 years can I tell you I need God to say something anybody ever just want to be honest I need God to speak like Lord I'm I'm here praying I'm before you I need you to speak and say something because silence makes me think that you don't see me or care but today I'm here to let you know that the Lord is not silent tell your neighbor real quick God is Not silent he's speaking today he's speaking in this moment now he's speaking to be able to share with you but scripture lets us know that sometimes we're called to wait on the Lord what if we're called to wait on the Lord and be able to wait with a good attitude anybody like waiting nobody you don't like waiting do you any anybody know waiting Sparks a little attitude in you anybody ever been on doordash before and you ordered and then they told you the time was going to kick back they told you you were gonna get your order in 30 minutes but 30 minutes became 40 minutes and then 40 minutes became and what did you do you caught a quick what attitude I'll cancel the order anybody start threatening when you're waiting I don't have to do this I'll cancel it anybody know you call ahead of time to a restaurant so that when you call ahead your expectation is that when you get there it's gonna be ready anybody ever found yourself in a place where you can smack your teeth when you get there and they say your order is not ready and you oh because the expectation is is that when I order when I do things ahead of time it should happen when I want anybody know that God doesn't move at our pace anybody ever want to ask God sometimes why are you so frustrated you told me to come boldly before the throne of grace I expect it when I came boldly you would answer me back and at moments God finds himself in a quiet place because he's trying to get your attention to learn to wait somebody just tell your neighbor real quick sometimes you gotta wait yeah but nobody likes waiting you ever been sick before you start praying to God heal me right now you ever prayed that one and you just waiting I don't I don't feel it yet anybody feel like they need God to move when they need God to move because what you feel on your heart is urgent I need God to move when I need him to move I need him to operate I need him to flow when I need him to flow but the problem is is that God is Not on your time the book of Zechariah it lets us know that God's people are coming out of a season of Exile a season of being oppressed and the prophet Zechariah is prophesying that there's going to be a Time where Jerusalem will be restored where there's a messiah coming and where things are going to get to where they need to be and it says they're waiting they're waiting on this Messiah to come and rectify all the things that are messed up anybody ever find yourself at a place that you are waiting on God to rectify your life with all the stuff that's messed up with it the Pastor said on Sunday if you wait on the Lord and be a good Carriage he will strengthen your heart the problem is is why you're waiting you're getting a little irritated because God's taking a little bit too long and when God takes a little bit too long you're waiting on him to move and operate in your life but the problem that you don't understand is that everything must happen in God's timing if it doesn't happen in his timing and it happens when you want it to happen then the issue is is you'll be out of alignment with the will that God has over your life and you will move at the wrong time in the wrong season and what you are trying to move in will change you more than God can change you Bible says it's 400 years the Bible lets us know that God is silent but here's the thing about God when he speaks and it comes into order whatever he speaks is already yes and amen I'm interested are you okay with God giving you a promise that he's not ready to fulfill in your life yet I'm interested are you willing and available forgot to move in your life in a very specific way but not ready to move when you want I can say this to you today God's ready to do something he's just not ready to do it yet and he wants to know can you trust him in the season of waiting when I when I look at the scripture I anybody ever found themselves trying to figure out why should I still keep going because it doesn't really feel like God sees me or understands where I am but there there is something about Hope can you can you just say the word hope the Bible tells us that there's something about hoping in God I want to get you on this course of Hope here's why I want to get you on this course of Hope is because we become a Prisoner of Hope because hope makeeth not a shame hope puts us in the perspective that God is still able to do something even though it doesn't look like he can do it can I can I share with you an idea is that God's reputation is impeccable anybody know somebody that's got some some jacked up reputations eat something done because they're always late y'all know that but don't look to the left or look to your right but you know the person that's always got an issue with being on time and you don't ask him to come because you understand through reputation there always what late a reputation is it's important because with the reputation God gives us the ability to be able to trust in him somebody say trust if I can trust in God then I can trust in his reputation if I can trust in his reputation then I can believe in what he says he's going to do here's the problem his reputation is a reputation that he can do what he said he will do he'll just do it when he wants to do it and I want to know are you willing to wait for God to do it when he's willing to do it the scripture says this it says Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 it says let us seize and hold tightly the confession of Our Hope without somebody say wavering for he who promised is reliable and trustworthy and he's faithful to his word this is important because if I am to believe that the plan that God has set out from my life and the plan that God has set out for those that are around me can come to pass I must believe that what God says he can do he can do if I can begin to rest in that then what I begin to understand that there is nothing that is impossible for God I can begin to understand that whatever God has spoken is already yes and amen it means I can stand in Surety to understand that he is faithful to his word so whatever he is spoken shall come to pass he's got a good reputation but the question is do you trust God's reputation that whatever it is that his City will do that you won't jump ahead of him to do what you want to do and get it when you want to get it you know oftentimes it's hard to believe for others when we can't see in their life the manifestation of what we want to see out of them point being I'm trusting God and believing God that he can do the impossible just not necessarily for you because anybody ever found themselves at a place where what you see around you defeats the idea that God can change some of the people and even yourself to the place where if you understand that he's able to do and he has a reputation of being able to do that God can change any situation I want you to get this because if he is able to change any situation that means the state of where I am is not the final state of where I will be it means that how I see myself in this moment is not the end to where God is saying that I'll be it is being able to see that there is something greater that God has in store and that God has in store for my life that just because it looks the way that it looks does it mean it's going to stay the way that it is crazy enough to start to believe that God can change me then I am I am can change anybody else anybody know that you have been in a place where you recognize it was not me but it was the favor of the Lord on my life anybody can recognize her that I understand it wasn't where I was it wasn't where I am but God is faithful tell your neighbor real quick God is faithful if I understand that the Lord is faithful here's what I believe I believe that he is able to keep his promises if he's able to keep his promises then he's able to bring me out regardless of what I see in my own life I might not have it all together I may not have it all figured out but God is able because he's what got a reputation and as a prisoner of hope I'm believing that God is able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that I can ask her or even think God is able to do the impossible but if I don't know his reputation then I don't learn to trust him the only way I can learn his reputation and learn to trust him is if I've opened his word and his word lets me know that he is faithful and he is just and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so when I'm moving understand that God is able to do way more than I could ever believe her I begin to trust the Lord and I begin to ask him God will you begin to move in my life like never before I know I've been this way for a couple of years I know I've been acting out of this way for a couple of years but I'm here today to let somebody know you can change when God is on your side I'm here today to let you know you don't have to stay up where you are but God can move in your life he's got a reputation it's an impeccable one if you're just beginning to share with somebody where the Lord has been if you begin to share what God has done in your life if you begin to whisper to your neighbor and tell them if you could understand the way that God has moved the way that God has operated in my life I don't deserve to be here today if you look at the way my mind was working if you look at the way I was damaged as a young person if you look at the way that my family drought grew up if you look at the way that things happened in my life I don't even deserve to be where I am today but it is by the faithfulness and the goodness of God that the Lord has still chosen me tell your neighbor real quick God still chose me and even in the middle of my mess even in the middle of all of my mess-ups even in the middle of all my Brokenness he still chose me he still chose me even in the middle of my broken ideas he still chose me even when my mouth was messed up he still chose me because he's got a good reputation of taking jacked up things and making them new I don't know if anybody else can have testified to that but he can take some messed up people like myself and Rewind the idea that I'm not fit and I'm not able to do what God says and he is able to look at me and all over again and say you are still chosen mess up broken don't have it all together you are still chosen tell your neighbor real quick you're still chosen God's got a reputation of using some old messed up people God's got a reputation of not using all the people that got it all together he's got a reputation [Music] I don't know if you're like me but it gives me hope it gives me hope because what I understand is that even though I still don't got it all together he's able to use me even though I still don't have all put together it's me I said I am still telling you even though my family might be a little jacked up and me included with them he's still able to use us see you wouldn't give up so easily on your brother you wouldn't give up so easily on your children you wouldn't give up so easily on your mother you wouldn't give up so if you just had a sense of hope that God's reputation is able to do exceeding uh abundantly above all that you can ask or think you would go and say we're gonna try this one more time I might have got it wrong last time but we gonna try this thing one more time okay tell your neighbor I still got hope I'm a prisoner of Hope I can't help but believe God's got more I Wish I Could Break Free from it I wish I could settle for the normal I wish I could settle for things being just as they always are but there's something that gets excited on the inside of me that doesn't let me rest that every time I think I'm unfit God still says there's more there's more for you to do there's more for you to accomplish there's more I want to use you for tell your neighbor real quick there's more okay there's more there's more of what God has you got some unfinished business because there's more don't you tap out now don't you tap out at this moment because you don't see it all together don't you tap out because it seems like God has been silent you got to remember he's able God's reputation is impeccable God's reputation is perfect so I'm a prisoner of hope y'all I'm I'm a prisoner that when I see you I see God manifesting something in your life that you never thought listen you need to get some people in your life that see something in you that you would never see in yourself you need to get some people that will say Hey listen real quick I just saw you I thought you're going to be a millionaire he said man I'm not here what are you talking about I I would never you need somebody to say no I see it uh and I believe it because well I'm a person I hope I I think I see God manifesting and using you I think I see God doing and something more than you could ever imagine or think I think I see God listen you need somebody in your life to look over you again and be able to say in your life God is tearing this thing around it doesn't matter what age you are it don't matter where you are can I tell you you already saying God's gonna turn this thing I just need to look at somebody and tell you real quickly it's not over yet laughs Pastor I'm done no you're not you you don't want to be in my circle I'm annoying I'm annoying I'm I'm the person that keeps pushing when you say leave me alone I'm the person that keeps seeing something in you because God has given me an eye to see it and I can be able to say there's something greater than where you are I I dare you go out on God I dare you allow God to use you greater than what you could ever imagine see I'm a Prisoner of Hope which means I'm always seeing the best of what God is able to do some of us we give up too early and we're ready to throw in the towel too early and it's because you don't have enough people around you telling you God's Got Something greater and if he says that he has something greater his reputation is that he can perform it and if he can perform it it means he can do it so here's what I believe if God's reputation is impeccable then God's plans are perfect Point number two God's plan is perfect you just got to be able to wait can I tell you that God's perfect plan for your life requires you to wait for him it requires you to not think you have it all together many of us are asking the question how because the way that it seems it doesn't seem possible oh can I really talk to somebody in here if I really could talk to you I would say if you could see it then it's not from God because what God has in store for you you haven't seen before what God's trying to do if you could do it then why would you need God said I'm trying to do something in you I am trying to elevate you push you take you to another level that I'm trying to help you understand what I have for you you haven't done it before you don't have the experience to do it you don't have the place to be able to do it so that's why I'm okay with being able to say I can't do this of my own self but if I trust in the Lord his plane is his plan is perfect I'm pretty sure though his plan doesn't look like your plan suggestions for God and he let me help you out anybody can help God on how this should look anybody got prayer time with the Lord Lord I need you right now to help me step one anybody got a a good plan for the Lord on the way he should do it but the problem is is that God is not interested in your way because God is saying if I go with your way your way doesn't get to see the rest of what I have in store your way only has a perspective to a certain limit I'm gonna tell you today whatever it is that you're thinking about you put a limit on it God says I'll go beyond the limit and I'll do but you'll never expect it because the issue is is that you think there's a limit to how far God can go and the Lord's saying today there's there's no limit tell your neighbor there's no limit see you already put a limit on the No Limit you're looking at your labor like it's a limit and God's like no there's no limit but then you're back like there's a limit so that's why you got to look at another neighbor because they didn't trust you find somebody else and say there's no limit there's no limit look at them they're like yeah real quick find another person a third choice just tell your third choice real quick there's no limit yup there it is you found the person there you go if I truly believe that there was no limit to what God could do I would I would be crazy enough to begin to open my life up to the possibility that what God has placed on the inside of me I have not even seen yet I would be crazy enough to believe that it doesn't matter what came before me it's all about what's about to happen after this I would not build my entire case on who I am and what we can do or what God has done before I would build my entire case on his reputation and knowing his plan is perfect and so what I would say is if I just wait on the Lord just a little bit scripture says in Psalms 18 and 30 it says ask for God his way is perfect somebody say perfect the word of the Lord is tested and tried he is a shield to all those who take refuge and put their trust in him his way is perfect his plan his plans got God God's God's God's plans God's plans are the kind of plans that get you to a Red Sea and make you decide whether you're going to quit or not God's plans are the kind of plans that that get you put into a lion's den but make you decide will you trust him see God's Building something in your life that you have to be able to walk into because if you can't walk into it it means that you'll forfeit everything that the Lord has for you and he needs you to be able to build yourself to the place where God is manifesting his presence over your life but you got to be able to endure something I don't have this scripture up here but I thought about this Isaiah 55 it says for your thoughts not my thoughts can you can you get that real quick his thoughts are not your thoughts you think you are a genius why wouldn't he take my suggestion it makes the most sense but he says my thoughts aren't your thoughts and my ways are your ways so if I don't know your thoughts and I don't know your ways then I gotta trust you if I've got to trust you it means I've got to walk with you if I've got to walk with you then it means I can't separate myself from you every time things get hard but I need to patiently wait on the Lord I need to trust enough to know that God can do whatever it is that he said he can do even if the plan doesn't look like my plan I'm okay with knowing that he's still able even though the way does not look like my way I'm still able to understand that he is what able and even if it doesn't go the way that I see I made a decision that he's able can you tell your neighbor real quick trust the plan God's got a plan for your life and they trust the plan God says I can do through you and for you and in you what you cannot do of yourself if I could just what trust the plan even though I think this way his thoughts may not be my thoughts and his ways may not be my ways but it's playing is perfect it's got a it's got a perfect plan for your life he's got a way that often times doesn't seem right to us but we're learning to trust him I want to say this about the potential and purpose that God has said over your life is that you cannot fulfill what God's calling you to fulfill by thinking the way that you've been thinking some of us are getting the same results that we've been getting all this time in our life because we trust and think that we have the solution but I'm crazy enough to think today that if somebody in here could change their perspective and understand that God's plan is better than your oh can you tell God's plan is better than your plan no no I think you you think it's happened half it's not half and half it's not 50 50. God's plan is better than your plan you need to tell somebody that real quick God's plan is better than your plan they're going to snap their finger at you and they're gonna roll their eyes and so you say guess what I'll tell somebody else tell your second choice God's plan is better than your plan I don't care if you smack your mouth I'll go to my third choice third choice God's plan is better than my plan you need to understand that that God's plan is better than my plan whatever I had in store I need to be able to trust God because his plan is better did my plan and point number three I need you to understand that God's love is unending it don't it don't matter what other people say God's love is on ending y'all know we we got restrictions on love these days love looks according into the way in which I receive it [Music] so it's like love is like I'll give you as much love as you get back to me you love me I love you you love me a whole lot I love you a whole lot you love me a little bit I love you a little bit but God says I loved you before you were even born this idea of the Cross was way before you got here his love for you is more than you could ever imagine or think God's love is unending the scripture says it's in Lamentations 3 22-23 it says the steadfast love of the Lord never it says his mercies never come to and in they are new somebody's saying new dare not stale they're not old they're not from yesterday they're not from the day before the steadfast love of the Lord they are new every morning great is your faithfulness great is your faithfulness to me oh God when I don't deserve it great is your faithfulness when I'm messing up continuously great is your faithfulness it doesn't matter what I've done it doesn't matter where I've gone it doesn't matter what I've said your love is unending the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases even in the middle of my mess it never ceases even in the middle of my drama it never ceases I thank God that God's love never sees her anybody got a praise right there that says I thank him his love never cease I thank God that he didn't give up on me when I gave up on myself here is what the Bible tells us it doesn't matter how far I try to get away from his love I can never get away from his love it doesn't matter if I go into the highest Heights or the deepest that's the Lord's love is unending [Music] Pastor what are you telling me are you trying to tell me that regardless of how much I've jacked it up he still loves me yes are you trying to tell me you don't know but what I did yesterday I totally disappointed myself in God are you trying to tell me the Lord is still with me I want to tell you this today yes he is his love is on ending you can Bet On It I want to speak this over your life today is that what God has for your life is greater than what you could ever imagine or think but you have to trust that God's reputation is impeccable that God's plan is perfect and that God's love is unending today I want to speak this over your life that you are a Prisoner of Hope what does that mean it means that you will not give up it means that even though everyone says differently it means even though the world has tried to shape you into something that looks different than what God's already called for you to be I want to say this to you today you are a Prisoner of Hope and I believe today the hope of God the love of God the impeccable presence of God will change your life forever when you look at your palm this year I need for it to remind you that God is a promise keeping God when you hold your palm this year I want you to look back at it and say he's a God that keeps his word when you fold it up and make it into some I need you to remember he keeps his promises he's faithful and just
