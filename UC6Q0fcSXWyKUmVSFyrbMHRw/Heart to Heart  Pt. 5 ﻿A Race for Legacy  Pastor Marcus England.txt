[Music] thank you can we jump into the word of God y'all we are on week 77 of heart to heart no I'm just playing we haven't been gone that long y'all but we are on week five of heart to heart and I really believe that what God is doing is speaking to the heart because out of the flow the issues the Bible says of life and so what I believe is important is that as our heart is conditioned to be in the place where God can use us the better our heart is the better we are amen the better our heart is the better we are and so as we put ourselves in position to have a heart that is before God I want us to end this series and conclude this series with an opportunity to talk about what I believe God is speaking in our church so we're going to get our hearts right we're going to continue to go after his word I implore you if this is your first week go back to YouTube go back take an opportunity to look at the messages as we talk about the condition of the heart we're having a heart our conversation where I want to talk today from is Hebrews chapter 12. and I want us to start at verse 1. we're going to go to verse 4. and I believe this is a opportune time for us to dig into God's word I I get excited about the word of God because one thing that is in this world is a lack of Truth and uh when I understand that I can go to a source that never lies when I can go to a place that will never try to fool me that doesn't have any other intentions I can go to the word of God and I believe there is a truth today that God is speaking through his word that he wants to speak to us so Hebrews chapter 12 get out your notes get out your Bible if you don't have it it's going to be on the screen and I want you to connect with us in this moment if God speaks it's starting at verse one it says this therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and sin which cleans e soul easily are so closely without effort so closely to us and it says and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us I pause there because I want to let you know that you are in a race [Music] you're not in a race against anyone else you're in a race for what God has set for your life it's a race set before somebody say it's set before me you can't go to anyone else's page to look at the race you can't go to anyone else's story you can't read anyone else's life the race has been set before you God is giving you a purpose God is giving you a plan it's not coupled up when you get married it's not broken when you get unmarried this is a race that he has set before you and I want you to think about that today because I want to know do you understand the race that you're in it says the race that is set before us and this is where our focus is looking to Jesus somebody say Jesus the founder and the Perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God there's a race before you but here's what I want to let you know he's race I don't know if you've ever run before you ran a 5k you run a 10K before I don't know if you've ever run a marathon before but you can get tired you can get weary in running the race you can get weary in the things of life you can get weary with your job you can get weary with your children you can get weary with your spouse you can get weary with the folk around you but it says let us run the race that is set before us so when moments in your life have you weary and confused and unsettled about what to do the writer tells us he says consider him who endured from Sinners such hostility against himself you're going to go through some things there are going to be some unfair moments in your life there are going to be some people that don't like you as much as you think the World Loves You There are some folk that just don't like you but it says consider him who endures such from sinners it says so that you may not grow weary or faint-hearted it says in your struggle against sin Pastor I'm not out here sinning no no no in your struggle against sin what is sin sin is the Disobedience to God it's your areas of lack of Faith it's your areas where you stop believing it is the areas of your life where you stop trusting God it's not just about the things that you can notice that are right and wrong it's it's the sin that gets before you that takes you off of purpose and destination to what God has called for you to do I want to let you know the things that are set before you that distort your mind and distort your vision and distort the way that you see God the things that come in to break your focus the things that come in to make you doubt what God has said and spoke over your life it says consider these things that are trying to be put before you and it says in your struggle against them you have not resisted to the point of shedding your blood it says this it doesn't matter how bad it gets you're not shedding blood in it can I tell you it doesn't matter what the BG and E Bill looks like you're not shedding any blood it doesn't matter how much the worry is it doesn't matter how much the relationship feels like it's failing it doesn't matter even the doctors results it's not to the shedding of blood it says remember him who endured we we just took communion it says remember him who endured so it says don't grow weary or faint-hearted you got this [Music] I just want to remind you that today but you got this can you can you tell somebody beside you real quick you got this [Music] they may not have believed you you didn't say it sincerely turn to somebody else on the other side and say you got this [Applause] they doing a little bit better but they're not as good as you wanted it you need encouragement this morning I want you to look at your third choice and just pause and look at them and say let's do this thing right now and I want you to tell them you got this there you go you believe that one I want to tell you you got this because the enemy is in your ear sin are you sure that's what God Said I want to come from the title and topic today a race for legacy a race for legacy let's pray father in the name of Jesus we're believing and declaring today that you will give us the strength and the ability to run this race of Legacy in Jesus name somebody say amen I was thinking about Legacy and I think about the legacy of my children I think about the Legacy that I desire to leave in the world I think about the Legacy that God has set over my life to be something greater than the material things the Bible says be careful in treasuring the things that moth and rust can destroy but it says to treasure those things that are eternal and I believe that as I thought about a race for legacy I thought about my grandson and last night I a daughter dropped off our grandson in anybody knows that when you get a Active Child the ability to get a lot of things done [Music] is very limited I don't care if you're watching a nephew I don't care if you're watching a niece it doesn't matter if it's a friend's baby you know when you get a child the productivity of what your day is going to look like comes to a slim place and we had our grandson yesterday and I have plans set up because in our household we communicate well [Music] and I set myself up because we're we're going to eat here and we're going to do this and things are going to go well and my wife says to me oh real quick somebody's coming over I said okay who is this she said you're you know because when when you want it to mean something you give ownership to the other person she said your grandson is coming over I said he didn't ask me if he could come over she said well he said he's coming over anyway so now I'm rearranging the plans and reconfiguring what I want to do because I'm talking about I want to get crabs and I'm going into this whole list of things but once he comes he disrupts some of the plans and we're rushing now to do everything I'm rushing to eat I'm rushing to get plans in motion and because I know that when he comes there's going to be an attention that we have to give him when he comes he he finds himself at the place that he's waking up from a nap that's a problem for me don't bring him at seven o'clock waking up from a nap I don't care if you need to Pat his little face open his little eyes you keep him awake because when he gets here I need him to do what go to sleep well that's not what they did and God bless these young parents today and ready to go he got in and there he started rolling he needs about 30 minutes in food to get comfortable with life other than that he doesn't want to talk to you he doesn't want you touching him it just it seems like his Spirit isn't quite in connection with the holy spirit so he doesn't really know the mind of God you know it's he he doesn't know he's all and so we get a man and we and we begin to get him something to eat and feed them and he starts to come alive and he's moving and he's rolling and so I've got to clean the table off and I've got to watch him and and he's moving and we get to a time where we can get rested we get in the bid and I notice that we have to alter and change things again because he's only supposed to stay with us for a couple of hours they are supposed to come back and pick him up and take him but I'm getting sleepy my wife is getting sleepy and we notice he's getting sleepy we put ourselves in the place and we say okay we're gonna put him to sleep we're going to turn these lights out he's going to sleep in the middle anybody knows when you have a baby or one-year-old in the middle that's active it's it's it's Anarchy he's wrestling but he I didn't know that he goes to sleep so he tosses he turns he he plays with my ear and and he and he does all of these things and I'm like no sir I don't have to deal with this too often but there's an adjustment somebody say adjustment there's an adjustment that has to be made because he is now made priority as his main priority that changing that Dynamic I have to sleep on my side anybody know when you're free you can sleep whatever way you want you can flip you can throw the covers up you can you know you know how you do I I have to be mindful that there is someone else with me in this set of circumstances so I'm sleeping at a very a horizontal level not to move to the left or to the right because if I move to the right I fall on if I move to the left I'm liable to get a karate kick in my head his body is turning he kicks me he he hits me he comes back again he wakes up he slaps me [Music] I said oh no he's got to go I'll go to sleep and by the time I go to sleep I wake up and notice it's 12 o'clock and he is still there but because I don't want to wake him I make the decision to adjust what I would normally do so that he can have rest and peace throughout the night even if it causes me discomfort I say this to you because oftentimes we forget the level of sacrifice that goes into setting up a legacy for people in our lives to live the way that we believe they're called to live each one of us as we've had parents have found ourselves in the place where we're always trying to make life better for our children our grandchildren children that are around us or people that come into the Next Generation we're working to make the world a better place for you and me because we are the world if you know we are the children and you know we are the ones who make a better day foreign for us to start living it's not scripture but there's a choice no I'm not going to keep going y'all somebody was about to put their phone up and just go back and forth here's what I understand is that there is a sacrifice in building the Next Generation there's a sacrifice in what's ahead there's a sacrifice for there to be greater in what I want to see to come and here's the understanding when I understand Legacy I understand sacrifice when I understand sacrifice I understand it's not always about me here's one of the things that I've noticed in life if I can start being really honest with you is I notice that oftentimes the Next Generation does not get the attention that it needs because we have a generation who still Lacks and does not have the Fulfillment of responsibility of purpose so many times you still have parents individuals uncles and adults who are still trying to find their purpose and it leaves them an inability to pour into something else because you still need pouring in too Legacy doesn't mean anything if you really don't have anything else to live for it doesn't really mean well Pastor I don't have kids I'm not talking about just children I'm talking about seeing a revelation of the next thing coming the reason oftentimes why you get yourself together is because of what you know is in expectation to come and be on its way I know if I want a better neighborhood I've got to start taking care of the neighborhood that I have right now I understand that if I want to see this home be able to appraise in a higher value I have to take care of sacrifice and put commitment to where it is right now the problem is is when I don't understand Legacy and what's ahead I have no commitment to a future that's better I only have a commitment to a present that I want to see for myself [Music] yeah and Legacy is nowhere a part of what I think and Legacy is not what I serve out of many of them find ourselves in the place where we serve for what we still want where we still want to go the things we still want to do but I want to let you know in life is that God is trying to build you the more stubborn you are to your building is the more summing your are to God using you to impact the Next Generation everybody wants the community to come together nobody wants to sacrifice of putting the community together to go in it to be a part of it to make a difference in it we all want Supernatural results for plans that we don't want our hands to touch foreign but the writing in Hebrews lets us know not in 12 but in 11. that there is something that you need to have in order to see a Hope to come he says I want to introduce you again to Faith faith is a substance of things that are hoped for it is the evidence of things that cannot be seen the reason that we have a hope is through faith the reason that we believe things can change is through faith the reason that we see things moving in a direction that we don't see them now is because we have faith and the Bible says that faith is the reason that we believe and see that the Universe was formed by God he goes in to name a group of people who had such a faith even though they did not see the outcome they saw the legacy of what was to be he goes and said Abel had a faith not like understanding what was going on he didn't understand where things were going he didn't understand what was next but he had a faith to sacrifice he goes on and say and then we have Abraham and then we have David and then we have the Patriarchs and he begins to give An ancestry to people who walk by faith and not by sight and he begins to say the reason and that they were established the reason that they were given credit because of the way they lived out their life and their legacy they may not have known what was coming they may not have even had children but one thing they knew is that I will be obedient to whatever God says and whatever God says will produce fruit and fruit produces Harvest and harvests shall bring something different than what we see in ourselves it wasn't about seeing it for themselves it was about seeing it for what was to come see there's a challenge in our lives to create Legacy because Legacy is something that we don't see in the present for what will be to come to build Legacy means I have to be building something for the future somebody say the future and the future can not only be about what I see for myself it must be about what I see beyond me and so he begins to describe in a very unique way that we have all of these ancestors all of us who walk by faith who never even saw the promise he says they they did it out of obedience I just want to let you know sometimes that sometimes in order to leave a legacy you've got to be obedient to God even though you don't understand what it's all for sometimes God gives you a vision or an inside or a way in which to look that's beyond what you can imagine a thing I can't imagine 90 year old Abraham sitting there and thinking to himself how am I going to Bear a child how is Sarah going to Bear a child and we're at an old age and Sarah the Bible says is in the tent laughing when she hears that some of us are laughing because we can't see the Legacy that will come out of the sea that God is choosing us to plant because it seems so much greater than what we could ever think I could never have a foundation that had millions of dollars that could change the lives of young people I could never put myself in position but here's the problem God is not asking you for your resources he's not asking you for your ability he's not asking you for your thoughts he is saying inside of you is the potential to do exceeding abundantly more than you can even ask or think so Hebrews says there are some people who believed in such a way that their belief brought them to a place that they never saw the promise my question is has God spoken something in your spirit that's not for you and not for your children but for your grandchildren's children that you could by faith sow the seeded Pastor I told you again I don't have kids I'm not here to talk about the kids that you have I'm here to talk about the community that you could change you say you want change and you say it looks good my question is what is the seed of sacrifice that you're willing to follow God without having the directions of what's next I'm sorry to tell you about the Holy Spirit is not always Spirit it does not give you the end destination and everything in between when you want it you have to take this thing step by step Lord I've been seeking you and you gave me a step so what's next he says what if you seek me you'll do what find me so it requires me to go back to the throne of grace where I'm may be able to attain help in the time of need God I need you to direct me to the next step on what to do some of us think we've got it all wrapped up and all together our lives are already finished we know when we're going to retire we know where we're going to retire the problem is is you don't create your own legacy God creates your legacy God talks about what happens with the seed that you have [Applause] because the problem is is the sea doesn't know where it's going but I'll never forget when overseer Joy started pastoring and people started looking at me saying so you think you're a pastor I said absolutely not you have lost all of your mind why because as a seed I could not see for myself the fruit that I would bear it wasn't my responsibility to even see it it was just my responsibility to be what obedient some of you are asking God what's next and God is saying I'm not here to give you what's next I'm here to help you be obedient because your obedient will obedience will put you into the next step of what your destination is we pray so that we know so that we can move but the problem is is that sometimes I just have to trust God with the unknown and believing that when I step in by faith that he is going to move right in my stead right where I am he'll say sow the seed and you'll ask God why would I sow the seed and what for God says here's the thing I need to let you know first of all it's not your seed number two you are my creation and number three I establish your purpose so all you're required to do is do what I say just tell your neighbor do what he says that's our problem we don't know how to do what he says without him telling us what we want to know and we have stubbornness on the inside let me be a little bit more direct I have stubbornness on the inside to be able to I'm not willing to move and God says I think you reverse the roles of who's in charge and who is God let me take you real quick back to Genesis before the world was even fauna I am I need to let you know I spoke everything that you see no into existence so remember I am the Lord God Almighty I establish all things I am all things I am the maker of heaven and Earth I am Jehovah I am the one that has kept you I am the one that keeps you right now it's not your grace certified job that you have secured up it is everything that I put in the pathway that I call for you to do don't you get it twisted this thing has never been about you it's always been about me I'll shut a government down where you think the government job is secure showed us in covid he can shut everything down all of us will be unemployed [Applause] so I'm not I'm not get this understanding so your obedience is not a service to me your obedience is what I require we think we're doing got a job like I have people that come up to me and like Pastor I'm not going to do that because you the pastor I'm like I said let's listen if you do it it's on you because that hinders your growth your relationship with God and then when it hinders it the Bible says there's a blockage between you and the Holy Spirit because the wages of sin is death and we always think it's only a physical death but what God is saying I'm deafening your hearing and you're seeing so now I'm speaking to a crowd that cannot see and ministering to a crowd that cannot hear many times it's not your lack of prayer it's your lack of ability to be able to discern what God is saying why because you're not a part of him or his presence so the Bible lets us know we've got this great crowd of witnesses surrounding us I don't see no Witnesses the Bible says in heaven there's a there's a cloud of witnesses can can I explain to you at times I think about it and I laugh at the problems that we tell God that our problems and the cloud of witnesses that are in heaven looking at us probably saying what you know lord I can't do that today because right now it's not the best time for me to do that if I if I couldn't make it there I would but right now it's not the best day you know we've got some things that we have to do and I promise you there are some people because at the end of Hebrews chapter 11 it says some they don't even mention by name some died some were sawed into some were burned and you're like I can't make it in your presence because it's not comfortable for my schedule today I really don't have time to give you the thanks and honor that is due unto you because right now my job is a very important job and I really don't have time to go over to you and God says you don't understand what it is to be a part of a legacy that runs the race that is set before them you're running your own race at your own level at your own comfort and God has said it's never going to produce the product of my purpose this is run the race and set before you my question today is what race has been set before you do you know what Lane you're in are you Ling five Lane six do you know where you're running do you know how long you're running do you know what race you're running you say I want Pastor I don't know I keep talking to God but I can't hear him then my question is What's blocking your hearing where's your obedience are you pulling out the scripture I'm so I'm so anxious about everything well the scripture lets us know be anxious for nothing with prayer and supplication make your requests be made known before God have you been giving a request over to God well no I haven't really been in my prayer time because I'm really occupied with the things of my life that I love doing right now here's the thing the thing that you are making a God in your life is going to be the very thing you're praying over and asking God will you please help me do it and I'm here today to let you know God said listen there is a race for you to run my question is are you willing to run run because I think at my older age if I start running I'm I'm gonna fall y'all like there's gonna be a stutter and a stride that I think I had when I was in Pre you know like young days in recess where you would take off and you would kill it but you don't have that same stride anymore and I feel like I'm just going to fall and hurt myself many of us are afraid to run our race because we're fearful because we fell before every time we took an opportunity to run the race and God says it doesn't matter how many times you fall I still picked you up again so are you willing to run the race that set before you [Applause] in a race to Legacy there are three things that I think we need to focus in on their area are important because it is the totality of who we are as individuals the first thing I think we need to look at is that we need to work on our financial Legacy many of us will find ourselves at the place where we don't think that finances matter to the next stage of where we want to go because we're looking to be broken stewards and managers of what we have but we're expecting prophetic miracles to come over top of what we refuse to do ourselves in order to leave a financial Legacy you have to know where you are what you make what you do you have to understand that God has given you a certain amount of money to be able to handle to do and to go what you need to do in that time frame you are to use those finances to build upon not to over expend right I got so in a financial Legacy I have to have something to give over everybody knows Hopkins Hopkins is one of those places you see that Harry and Jeanette Weinberg y'all know the weinbergs I used to hang with them a long time ago why do you know the weinbergs because of their what their legacy their names are on buildings you don't know who their kids are you don't know what they do you don't even know if there is really a hat Weinberg you don't even know if they're real people I looked them up they're real the question is is how do you know them you know them according to your legacy here's the issue Legacy does not come out of comfort Legacy comes through discomfort it comes through the understanding that I'm sacrificing for something else because I see the value and purpose in the legacy of what it is it does not mean I just do for me it means that whatever God has given me is for me but it's also for what is to come the financial Legacy that I had the reason that I budget is not so I can get more money and have more things it is for the resource to be able to be a blessing and to make an impact in the world and so I restrain myself in the things and I manage my life in a way that means that the seed of what I have can be put back into the ground to produce more fruit here is the thing if you don't have finances to put into something how do you produce more fruit for those finances to create a greater future if you spend it on everything you want and you spend it on everything that you see I am pretty sure you are not setting yourself up to make a impact in the world the Bible lets us know that the world seems to understand Finance Management better than we do because they understand saying there's something that should be left behind her engine that didn't just leave something behind for their kids they left something behind to remember their names Abraham Isaac Jacob are names that we still claim today why because we understand there was a sacrifice made so that Christ could come and save and restore our lives back to him my question today is what does your legacy look like and how do you choose to make the decision to reproduce where you are now young people I want to let you know today is that the best thing that you could do is learn how to save and be a part of a process of not spending more than you have people don't like Financial conversations because now it's talking about restraint and it's talking about not getting everything you want and it talks about setting your family up here's what you have to understand when you have the resource it gives you the ability to build upon the resource that you have gives you the ability to build upon the fact that you're able to gather your family every Sunday or the fact that you're able to gather your family every other week or the fact that you're able to gather your family bi-weekly gives you an opportunity to speak life into your children it gives you an opportunity to sit down at the dinner table and be able to have a dinner that you don't have to require everybody to do a potluck because you know you don't like their chicken anyway and you can be able to provide for because you see the seed of how important it is to be able to pull together your family unit so that you can pour back into them not busyness but an understanding of where they are going in life but you cannot do it when all of your finances are so broken and so poured out and so expended that you have no seed to sow every sower needs seed [Music] so here's the question what you're doing in your life that you're spending your finances on is it seed need or greed is it seed need agreed where are you how are you setting your family up for the next level how are you setting the community that you want to change up for the next level how are you looking into the building here's the idea that we think someone needs to give it to me because I'm not willing to do the work to have my part God wants to bless you with the building when you have no more resource because now you're operating by what you go you're like Lord bless me because I can't give you a building why because you can't take care of your own house we have broken expectations that God is supposed to fill in the gaps where we're too lazy to do the work but the responsibility is to do the work so that I can have the seed so that the seed can be watered and that water sea can bring about what a harvest I'm called to bear fruit and to multiply anything that I have is from God and everything that God gives me is my responsibility to manage Pastor what if I've mismanaged it then you go and ask for forgiveness and ask for another what seed and say God I'll make changes to sow this seed and produce the Harvest to water it and you will produce the Harvest that needs to come from it where you are today if you want real Financial change for those who so sparingly do what reap sparingly so in order to sow generously that means you have to I mean to read generously you have to do what so so concept is I've got to have something to sew with so what am I using my finances to build I want to drop this to you for financial change in your life you need to change you don't need to pray for more money you don't need to pray for a raise even though if God wants to do it I'll take it but you need to learn how to manage what you have now what do I need to do Pastor I need to budget I probably got bleeded online or something like it was a curse word like no you got a budget you got to put yourself in position because you understand I am on what level I'm on a seed level every time you get paid I want you to look at the finances every time you receive money every time that God gives you something say God show me how to re-invest it this is seed seed is only for who the sower God gives seed to the who sower the sower does what sows it God supplies the seed the sower sows it takes the time to water and the Bible says and he does what multiply it somebody say multiply that's God's responsibility so I need you to understand in order to leave Legacy you must start with a financial Legacy you've got to learn how to manage your finances not how to find out better things to drive [Music] young people you're making good money do you have a deposit or a down payment for your home do you have the ability to be able to put down if nobody else is there to help you my boo gonna help you your boo might be broke or you you ain't got no book can you do it for yourself the scripture lets us know in Proverbs 13 22. it says a good life gets passed on to the grandchildren my question today is what are you passing on what financially do you have to pass on to the next generation Point number two I want you to be able to live out a healthy Legacy healthy somebody say healthy yep all of us are struggling not all of us but some I listen I'll just talk about myself you want to strive to live a healthy life why because you can pass Health down you need to go to the doctors women and men because if you know what's happening with you you can help preventative measures what happens with things that flow from you you need to be healthy you need to walk in healthiness you need to invest in living a healthier life how do you do that change begets change scripture lets us know First Corinthians 6 19-20 and it says this haven't you learn it says that your body is the home of the Holy Spirit God gave you and that he lives within you don't you know this it says your own body does not belong to you underline it highlight it Circle it your body does not belong to you in a relationship your body does not belong to you with your boo your body does not belong to you in your health your body does not belong to you okay you're on a leasing no I'm just playing y'all you don't have to give it back [Music] it says for God has bought you with a great price so use every part of your body to give Glory back to God because he owns it I'll be reading a scripture back to myself tomorrow before I'm looking at going into the gym that's all you need to do put it on your mirror he [Music] is using pastries I mean they bless our soul I mean people were weeping and crying because they blessed their soul so much have the spirit of Monday what is the spirit of Monday Pastor is when you make the commitment to do it on Monday y'all know that spirit all right Monday I'ma change y'all know that Spirit everybody don't put your hand up this is it don't anybody know that you get that pastry and then you say God do it after this God do it we've got to work on our mental emotional health y'all we gotta work on our physical you can't just sit there and be swole and be uh uh uh a word out by the demons in life because you have not worked on your mind gotten some mental healing and some emotional work do not keep ing you let's look to your neighbor real quick and say Amen some of y'all one and two so I gave you an Audi amen you need to work on it you may be physically doing well but there's some emotional trauma and there's some mental trauma that you refuse to work on and the enemy keeps convincing you because you're making money or because you're good at where you are in your bank account or because you feel good that you're enough I'm here today to let you know he will torment you in every area of your life until you get some help help is not a bad word I'm teaching like this because these are the things that we're struggling with we're speaking in tongues but we're broke we're giving all praise and glory and honor to God and worshiping but we're going back home tormented in depression and anxiety and we have bad health habits and the Bible says that that is not of God we're failing and we don't feel like doing what God's called for us to do because we're unhealthy like Lord restore my body I can't because you won't do the part of giving you this is self-examination right here so Lord you want me to preach this yes do I have to preach it yes and number three God's call for us to build an Eternal Legacy Psalm 74 and 8 says this and we will never forget it we'll be telling this story to the last generation we will all praise the Lord and tell about the amazing things he did see it's hard for a generation to believe in the god that oftentimes I come out and express about because it's hard when they haven't seen it passed down in a generation because what's been passed down is is sports can get you there and education can get you there but we forget to tell them that God gets you there and so we have a generation filled with NFL players basketball players we have a generation filled with people who believe that's the success of who they are is going to come through what they do but we have not prepared them for when life goes astray and the enemy is coming in as a roaring line seeking who he may devour we have not passed down an Eternal Legacy that says I will get on my knees and pray and go before God the father and say Lord if you can't deliver me I don't know who let me tell y'all something Gucci shoes can't do it I want to let you know and Alexander McQueen first can't do it I want to let you know Affinity belt won't deliver you when the enemy is on your back you will need to get on your knees and say father I thank you and I need you right now to move in the midst I won't move from this place until you move in my life we're teaching temporary [Music] traction I don't care what degree you got when the enemy comes in like a flood will the spirit of the Lord lift a standard in your legacy or will they get wiped out because nothing was sewn in eternally well you know I don't wanna I don't want to pressure them you know I don't wanna I don't want to make sure I don't you know I don't want them angry at me you are telling me you rather them die out in that world than have an Eternal Legacy on their life that says come hella hot water I trust him I believe him he is everything I need he is our way he is my supplier he is my need I don't care if you want to go to church come on because you're going to realize later it's going to change your life the Bible says raise your children in the way they should go not the way they want to go we out here having debates and voting I'm gonna tell you what happened when I grew up there was no vote where are you going the same place I go every week [Music] because you don't understand it's getting worse out here understand the phone calls I'm getting of suicide of children saying I have depression and naming it and they're putting words to it and they're saying pastor I'm trying to tell you I'll let my life go cause it's worth nothing and you're sowing in money is the answer they need an Eternal Legacy [Music] something that moth and Russ won't destroy we can teach them everything else don't you dare lack in teaching them the things of God don't you dare lack in giving them the testimonies of What the Lord Has Done I remember when I don't you you need to sit down at the dinner table and grab everybody together and say let me share what God has done the reason you're going where you're going and you're sitting where you're sitting and you're driving what you're driving and you're doing what you're doing it's because of what she did in my life don't you forget what God has done don't you forget who God is I don't care what you wear just don't forget them [Applause] [Music] foreign Gucci and be established in the things of God [Music] why because I know he's a deliverer he's a Healer but he's also a provider I'm saying that to you today because I'm very very scared about what we're building and how we're building and if we don't understand we're surrounded by great Cloud Witnesses the Bible says and we're called to lay aside every way and The Sinner so easily besets us my thought today is if you're barely holding on what do you think they're going to go through if you're struggling what do you think they're going to go through if they're telling you they feel hopeless and worthless and they're measuring themselves by how they look and they're measuring themselves about what they wear and their shoes if you think that you're struggling now tell me what do you think the enemy is doing he's not easing up he's putting more weights build your Hope on things [Music] eternal the Bible says hold to God's unchanging hand I'll say this last thing and I do not apologize what God always is doing some of us are suffering Where We Are because someone didn't pour the seed into us [Music] three years old and you're still struggling 25 years old and still don't know who you are you're still waiting for somebody to come and rescue you you're still waiting for somebody to give you the definition of Who You Are you're still waiting for the excuse of why you're not where you are and you keep finding a way out because you see no way into what God's called you to do and I'm just saying this to you today is that your healing is going to be so important to the healing of what you pour back into because a broken person doesn't really pour healing back into broken people everything begets something of its kind [Music] you're worrying about what they think about you but you haven't spent the time to worry about what God thinks about you and I'm speaking at today some fathers and mothers in here you need to Speak Life over your children over your daughters they're measuring themselves on what they wear how they look and God is saying I created them to do something far beyond I pray that we're not a shallow Church [Music] that what we produce is something that goes into the ground the Bible says that even when we raise them up in the way that they should go it says they won't go far from it when they make that mistake and you're looking like I wish you wouldn't have done that the Bible says but there's a seed that you sowed and there's water to that seed that you were putting on it that will produce a harvest but here's the problem when you're more focused on producing your own seed that you don't see the seed for the Next Generation miss everything that God's trying to do Pastor why do you Pastor believe in every young person that's in this place Pastor why do you preach so so vigorously because I believe the chains of depression the chains of anxiety the change of selflessness that people feel I believe they can be broken I don't just do it because it's the mix if I wasn't pastoring I'd be somewhere how can we change your life it doesn't matter where I am I don't need a thing to do it for me I don't need an organization to do it for me that's not where I get my identity from my identity is through Jesus Christ it's always been so I'm trying to tell you today well Pastor are your kids perfect no but do they have a lot of C man I'm in there dumping bags thank you [Applause] I'm putting seed in them around them on top of them watering it flooding it and I don't always immediately see the Harvest but scripture said raise them up in the way that they should go and when you do it they won't depart you think they're sitting in here in their sleep and there's nothing but seed going inside of them you know they don't like church it's not for them to like nobody likes planting season but when you see that joker beside you change the world cause you kept them in church when they feel like it and you see that joker come out here on the stage and start declaring The Works of the Lord when they never thought they would be the one but God had already chose them you'd be like oh it was worth it I okay was worth it I don't care they were sleeping and that Depression was on them but they remember one thing that came from service and they said I could pray this thing through I'm crying in my bed right now but Jesus if you are ripped save me open my mind write the thoughts of depression I need you right now every seed will be worth it [Music] we can play with our next Generations eternity y'all so I just believe it pass today sleep I don't care let them get in there let's see so then pass the tie after service he comes and he's got teens group and he's like putting more seed in and so we just seen them watering and watering them watering them water in the water and they like oh I don't feel like being in this church and I was like just keep water and drown them if you need to [Applause] I'm so glad my mother never acts my opinion about my eternity I'm so glad I'm so glad she never sat and tried to figure out was I okay with this Jesus I know this where you're going and what you do with it after I can't help you but this is what we gonna do and then you would say you're into 18 but then she kept doing it Ma and then Wednesday we're on the phone and she going in because this is what the blood does let me tell you what Jesus said I said Mom what'd he say because it's changed and that appetite she said I used to sit and it blessed my heart she said I used to sit on the phone with your grandmother the same way the scripture says we will all praise the Lord and tell about the amazing things keep planting and ordering and planting and watering and wait for God to give the harvests now I'm on the phone like what do you do ma what do you think can we pray do you believe in signs Miracles and I believe it son Let's do let's talk about it let's pray about it let's see God's face about it what do we need to do now that's the car but you can't see it when they ate 9 10 12 18 and you're asking now what you think what you think no it's ain't what you think I gotta give this to you because the Bible says the product of it is that they won't go far away from me as we close today we're in a race for legacy time is of the essence we've got to get people back to God not just back to church back to God tell them I want you to go somewhere I want you to do something I want you to buy a home I want you to do greater than the generation before you I want to set you up to succeed and be everything that God's called for us to do but we ourselves have to be in a race for the Legacy that God set for our lives today I'm Gonna Leave it and I thank God that he reminds us of it every day can we celebrate God in this place for what he's doing Hallelujah whoa amen amen you can have you see I just want to pray over you in this moment and just believe in what God is speaking in this place father in the name of Jesus seed has been sown all over this place and father I pray to every person no matter where they are that there would be healing that there would be a manifestation of what we've been sowing what we've been watering that we would not give up not get fing hearted but father I pray for the Next Generation down I pray that they would see the value and that they would know the value that's inside of them it's not predicated on their parents it's not predicated on what their friends say it's predicated on what you say so God we speak life in the Next Generation and the generation to come we speak God that there be freedom that there be a sense of understanding and clarity of who they are it's not in what they have but it's in who you've created them to be the Bible father today we pray through your word through this through this school that all of us would come to the police where God literally you will set us up financially that God you would speak to our health and that God he would build our Eternal Souls for we love you we honor and we thank you in Jesus name
