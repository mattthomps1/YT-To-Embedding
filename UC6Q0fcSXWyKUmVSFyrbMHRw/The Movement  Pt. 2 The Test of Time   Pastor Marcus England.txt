[Music] come on help me give god a praise in here come on y'all know how we do can we praise god in here come on can you help me celebrate our god our king of kings can you help me lift his name on high in this place today anybody know the lord to be good anybody know the lord to be amazing anybody know god to just be amazing god that he is anybody he kept you this week he woke you up anybody know the lord is good amen amen god bless you on your way down to your seat just tell your neighbor real quick i'm so glad i sat next to you i'm so glad i sat next to you welcome to the mix my name is marcus england and i'm the lead pastor here and i am so grateful today that we are in this place together that we have the opportunity to worship god on one accord and what i believe the bible lets us know is there is something that happens when two or three people are gathered together they have the same mindset they're thinking some of the same things we're even working out some of the same struggles the bible lets us know we can get on one accord and then when we're on one accord with god the bible lets us know that he can do something as we're touching and agreeing today and so what i believe today is there's somebody that you're sitting next to somebody you're connected to today that you're just saying in this place i just want to let you know i don't even know what you're going through but i'm telling you today i'm in agreement that god would change your situation and i believe that that's what we're doing today in community is we're believing that god is going to change the very nature of the situation we're in and while he's changing it we're going to give him praise and while he's changing it we're going to rejoice to who he is and while he's changing it we're going to thank him by faith somebody say in advance come on i don't know if you like that but listen i i've heard about people getting book deals and and and what the expectation is is that they're going to write it but the thing is they get in advance before it is done i'm here today to let you know that we're going to praise god in advance for what he is going to do and what he's already done and that's a faith that's activated believing that whatever it is that god is speaking and whatever it is that god is saying it is already yes and amen and i just want you real quick yeah this is a neighbor kind of talking church i i need you to talk back to me we get a little bit you know connected in here but i say this to you today is that i just believe a praise in advance is already knowing that god is going to do it anyhow and so i just need a couple people right in your seat you don't even have to get up and don't scare your neighbor but can i get somebody just to take about 10 seconds and give god an advanced praise for what he's already do hey i feel somebody's an expectation somebody's believing god's going to do it anyhow it doesn't even matter anyhow praise i believe it right now online i just want you to give about any praise because it's in advance he's going to do it anyhow i believe it today it's in advance of what god is going to do and i'm believing right there today you did something i'm not even gonna ask you do nothing else well i might as you talk to your neighbor so don't worry about that but i believe that in advance praise right there is believing god you're going to do something we are in week two of our series the movement as we're talking about the establishment and the movement of the church that god has for us and i want you to open your bibles to matthew 28 matthew chapter 28. [Music] we're going to start at verse 16 and go to verse 20. here's here's what i want to give a preface of this scripture is that this scripture is about the commission that god gave to his disciples those who were his followers the bible says that he gave this them this instruction so they knew what to do as he was ascending back into the right hand of the father and he wanted to give them instruction about what you are to do now the bible lets us know that god has introduced jesus and jesus has now died on the cross but he did not stay there we learned this last week but that he rose again and the bible says with all power in his hand and through that resurrection we have the understanding that our faith is landed in that jesus rose from the grave so as we're looking at this in his rising he gets them together and he has a conversation and he lets them know i have a responsibility for you as a follower and i want to commission you in this word to do something that you may not have done before even though you know about it i'm calling you to be a disciple matthew chapter 28 verse 16 and through 20 says this now the 11 disciples went to galilee there were 11 because judas the betrayer of jesus hung himself poor judas and it says to the mountain to which jesus had directed them when they saw him they worshiped him but the bible says some doubt it and jesus came and said to them all somebody say all all authority all authority in heaven and all authority on earth has been given to me go therefore and make what disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe somebody say all all that i have commanded you and behold i am with you always to the end of the age that's the commission that jesus gives his disciples as he begins the movement that starts the way that begins christianity in the church but what i want to give to you is that if there were no disciples after they had followed jesus for three years if they had walked away he would not have been able to commission them properly because the time that they spent with him would have been wasted but the bible lets us know they were with him and they wanted to know what was next anybody ever want to know lord you saved me god you brought me salvation i'm in covenant with you but what's next what do you have for me what are you asking of me and so when you walk into the stage of your walk with jesus you come in as an explorer of god you're in fellowship you're you're maybe attending services but what you find yourself is is that you're trying to find out who god is when you accept jesus into your life now you become a beginner christian you're a beginner with god and in that stage you're finding yourself learning to know who he is when you move to that place now you're becoming one close to god there's intimate relationship and there's intimate moments with him and that's what i want to jump into is because many of us have become converts but we have not become close we've converted but we haven't become close with god and so what i want to do is establish this idea that god is not calling you to sundays god is not calling you to saturdays god is not calling you to a day of the week god is calling you to relationship somebody say relationship god's calling you to relationship but relationship comes through discipleship church comes through attendance [Music] what i want you to have today is something greater than sunday because here's what i want to let you know about sunday sunday the enemy is trying his best to distract you i don't know anybody today but i promise you you were getting ready and the enemy was trying to distract you trying to get you off course trying to get you in the wrong direction some of you are married he was trying to start a fight early in the morning go hand me these runny eggs want me to go to church with these runny eggs going on you don't even know why you were upset you just upset it's the enemy's way of distracting you so that he does not allow you to get to the place where you truly can build relationship with jesus christ in mark chapter four verse three through eight i wanna get you to this because once we put it together it's gonna be like oh this is why i need to grow in my discipleship the bible says in mark chapter four verse three through eight jesus gives a parable he says listen behold a sower went out to sow that's what swords do they sow and as he sold some fell some seed fell along the path and the birds came and devoured it it says other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and immediately it sprang up since it had no depth of soul but it says and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root no word no nothing to cling to no teaching no wisdom says since it was broken in such a way i lost my place y'all let me start verse 4 again it said and he sold some sea and fell along the path and the birds came and devoured it it says in the other seat fell on rocky ground and when it did not have much so it immediately sprang up since it had no depth of soul and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it what withered away other seat fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and did what choked it and it yielded no grain and other seeds fell onto good soil and produced grain growing up and increasing and yielding 30 fold and 60 fold in a hundred fold pasta what in the world does that mean let's jump to verse 14. the bible says the sower is word the sower sows the word and these are the ones along the path where the word is sown it says when they hear satan immediately somebody say immediately satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them and these are the ones sown on rocky ground the ones who when they hear the word immediately receive joy it says but and they have no root in themselves but endure for a while then when tribulation and persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away and others are the ones sown among thorns they are those who hear the word but the cares of the world the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word and it proves unfruitful but those who've stayed in who've walked through discipleship who's seeking the lord the bible says diligently but those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirtyfold sixtyfold and a hundredfold i wanna come from the message today a test of time a test of time can we pray father in the name of jesus thank you for this moment thank you for your people thank you for your word we pray that what will happen today would be what happens in verse 20 that the word would be sown on good soil but father we thank you we love you and honor you in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians i so appreciate you guys can y'all help me y'all already clapping y'all just like pastor we know we know we gonna give it up can y'all help me give it up for our dream team it helps to make so much happen [Applause] i like to talk about this because we talked about understanding the relationship with god that our faith comes through the resurrection on last week in order to understand that now i have this faith in jesus christ that gives me everything that i need to propel forward in the purpose that he has set over my life i must understand what's next so that i can continue to grow and who god has called for me to be the idea is that oftentimes we can settle in the place of being a convert from the wages of darkness into the marvelous light of jesus christ but the problem is is we settle for an eternity without a discipleship an eternity without a relationship with god and you know what i hear so often is that when people come in they want to know what's my discipleship but here's the problem with wanting a discipleship is that when you want a discipleship but you're not willing to suffer you're going to find yourself at a place where you're knowledgeable but you can't stand the test of time the bible lets us know that there are things that are going to take place in this world that are going to push you over to the edge there are things that are going to happen that will put you in a place that you will doubt if god is with you and what he is saying is is i've got to establish what we call a relationship what we call a discipleship because if i don't you will fall away the cares of this life will take you out of here folk will get on your nerves so bad that you will find yourself in a place where you will stay away from every person possible just because they get on your nerves everybody know that people can just sometimes work on a nerve anybody got that you know that you're just like listen i i got to stay away because every time i go over there they start getting on my nerves i ain't got no time to sit there and deal with them they'd be running their mouth i'd be ready to put my hands on somebody and all your salvation is lost because people be peopleing they'd be trying you trying to see where you at trying to trying to work up the old you that through salvation jesus christ has promised that there is a new you that is coming forth but everything that the enemy tries to do is to keep the new you from coming forth so you get attached to being in jesus but staying old and you stay a convert and not a follower so many of us have found ourselves in lives where we settle for christianity but we don't settle and give ourselves an opportunity for relationship we know of god we just don't know god we know about him because we read the bible before but we don't really know him we haven't had experience with him we haven't delved enough into this relationship that we have received the gifts that are already expressed and given to us through the power of jesus christ the bible says and when they were baptized and when they were saved and when they move forward the bible says there is the gift of the holy spirit that is already available to every person but we stop at a convert space because we're scared of the transformation that has to happen inwardly because it's a spiritual transformation and we rather do an outward transformation because we're more in control of changing our actions than changing our hearts and we love the idea that if i could stop this and do that and bring about a complacent thought that as long as i'm not doing then i'm not in that place but the problem is because the enemy distracts so well he reminds you often that that place that has not been healed is still triggering on the inside of you you know how it works when you own 695 and traffic is going a little bit extra slow and somebody jams on that break or gets in front of you you know how you react that old you start coming back out here's what you've got to understand is that there's a process in who you're becoming and that process gives you an idea as the holy spirit speaks to you it tells you that's not you anymore but discipleship produces newness if you walk and have salvation without discipleship you work on your eternity but you don't work on your earthly self and you stay being the same individual that's why the people around you are confused because they see you committed to a thing that doesn't really seem like it's done anything in you when you learn that through discipleship humility comes through discipleship we bear fruit through discipleship we change the world you find yourself at a place where you look and you say can i really do that well if you walk through like these disciples of three years of watching jesus do and going and making and and you learn and become more than a convert but you become a changed individual you stop worrying about what you're doing and you start worrying about who you're becoming and god is so much more concerned about with what you become because once you start becoming more like him you have the ability to fulfill the work that he spoke in genesis that he said in the image of us meaning father son and holy spirit he says i'm making man in my own image the problem is is i don't have the ability to turn over to be who god called me to be without there being relationship that conforms me back into the image that salvation did which was put me back in position so as i'm in back in position god begins to form me the problem is is that oftentimes my salvation brings me to a place of close proximity with him in eternity but distance with him on earth and i'm wondering why church doesn't really impact church doesn't work without relationship relationship comes with time and suffering somebody say suffering my pastor i will not here's what we like we like convenient discipleship on my time when i want it how i want it don't go too far now and then if you can give me discipleship with people that look like me are me my age do the same thing i do and uh make sure that they like me and i like them i'm ready to go god and the problem is is that when jesus called the disciples to follow very explicit you see very quickly that he calls people that he knows is jacked up i want to first let you know that the first recommendation that god gives out for discipleship is that you can acknowledge you're jacked up you see you don't need relationship with jesus if you think you're good it's when you recognize you ain't got it all together your thinking is faulty you don't have every space in your life all sealed up and all together you start to recognize i'm a little crazy i'm a little off the way i think is a little broken the ideas that have been established inside of me they come out of some broken spaces so what i start to do is start to say who can help me and jesus says i can but the bible says you have to what sup with me something means there's time there's there's this idea of of just being in connection there's there's time of sitting down and shutting everything off and saying my discipleship is to grow me further how far can i get with where jesus wants to take me he says i can take you to limitless places but it's going to cost you it's gonna cost you it's gonna cost you your sexual desires it's gonna cost you the things that you wanna go after that is all about you it's gonna cost you your pride and your ego it's going to cost you more than what you could imagine or think well pastor what does it cost because if it doesn't cost it can't bring change if it's not costing you anything anybody know real quick if you ever been in a relationship right you get with somebody and y'all start seeing each other like y'all dating but then y'all moved to like dayton dayton like we together and you'd be like oh you're not really together you're like no we together together when you say it twice it's the step right before marriage but when you're in relationship and you make a decision to say what i'm going to be exclusive with you just me and you it means there's something you have to give up there's some things you got to let go there's some places you got to walk away from i can't do that no more fellas i'm in a relationship girl i can't go that way no more i'm winning i'm in a relationship i can't go that way why because the relationship requires you to let something go the problem is is we want relationship with jesus while staying the same we don't want to give up anything we don't want to let anything go we we want to keep everything we want to be we want to fulfill the flesh we want to do everything we know how to do the problem is is that he says you cannot be my disciple if you don't give up your life and we just trying to out here live y'all here's the thing i understand as the bible says if we can really get to the place we could understand what god's trying to do in us and every seed that's sown that we're seeing and watching happen today that seed could take root i just want to know real quick do you want the seed the word of god to take root in you if you wanted to take root guess what it can change you but it's got to have a place of root real quick danny can you help me out real quick we're going to talk about what this is he says he says there is a sower who sowed seed seed thank you so much there's a sower who sells seed and it says and some seed fell along the path and it says in the birds it's given a figurative statement the enemy satan came and he what devoured it man sunday was good i'm trying to tell you pastor preach not even pastor pass a preach pastor was preaching up something and i'm telling you i just feel the joy of the lord i'm feeling good up in here [Music] i can't wait to get the brunch because i'm going to tell somebody about jesus and the bible lets us know that there is a seed sown in the word of god and that seed is sown and we're like that's it because that word is everything i need i'm gonna have that say i can't i can't wait it's a seed i can't wait but the bible says as soon as you got into the lobby and you got that phone call y'all know that phone call that way you out soon as that moment happened soon as you thought about that thought soon as that conflict happened it says in the bible that the birds devoured it danny can you help me real quick some of us are coming from sunday to sunday thank you we're coming every sunday i'm still use that we're coming every sunday but the problem is is that the word isn't going into your hearts it's just tickling your ears because you think going to church is a good thing to do and if i go to church god's going to see my attendance and when he sees my attendance i should be good to go and he should bless my week because i'm not playing with kathy on monday i will smack her but i'm going to church first to make sure i got to wear nobody out jesus be offense that's how we feel good that's the priest yeah i'm feeling good y'all and as soon as we get out from the word and even some of us while we're sitting here right now the enemy is working but the bible says he's so good at it you had joy and here's what happens with the gospel it just goes and be like go on child you better praise them you may praise them on up that's what you better do yep cause i'm about to wear you on out and the problem is is that no longer do we have this joy because the joy was predicated on a seed that fell on stony ground your heart wasn't really open you were just here to do church and be a good christian so it wasn't about it piercing the heart it was just about let me check off the list what i've been doing for years which is attending church but not being changed you got perfect attendance you here you're rolling you didn't even took growth track but the problem is is you know swept it right on up now you're considering i don't know if i'm going back this month i need jesus i'm gonna take some time away i got to get myself together and the bible says you know why that's happening because there's a lack of relationship you know of a god but you don't really believe in the resurrection of a god because the resurrection would lead you to a relationship the resurrection would lead you to a concept to be a convert but you would actually follow and flow into the ways of god then he says it goes back he lets us know he says other sea fell on some rocky ground where it didn't have much soil it says not much soil at all and it immediately sprang up you didn't join growth track and everything i'm ready to do church oh i'm ready to be a part of i want god to do this for me and i'm going to join the church because i want to be a part of god's church i want to do something and it says yeah and it starts and that seed flows it says that's that's good seed what are you talking about that's that's real good seed it said but when the sun rose it was scorched because they had no root y'all life hit you real quick you ain't got no root you don't got no word no word in your heart you don't know what to grab on to so you grab on to affirmations and feel good and you're part but you're disconnected then it says other seed fell among thorns you know what i'm gonna drag i'm gonna get in there i'm gonna make it happen i'm i'm a i'm a really good and it says it and guess what it can produce it can yield no grain because it gets choked out we just so we got seed and then you wonder next what happens there's a there's a seed that is sown to those that are willing to build relationship and have discipleship it says that that seed is sown and it produces good grain good harvest but it takes time for harvest to grow the problem is is that you're getting into a space in a church where you have all of these requirements but you have no time to suffer and your lack of suffering has put you into a place of depletion where you have nothing to hold on to and the bible says there's a seed for those but they've gone through something they've been through something they weathered the storm they've walked through they've been in the valley of the shadow of death they found themselves broken at times but they said lord you are my god and i will never forsake you the bible says hey they gotta see let's see that's these gonna grow real well they they're in a place but the problem is for the rest you're trying to figure out why twenty percent of the church is impactful you're trying to figure out why the city is still the same way it's because the other people have not built time in relationship can you make it to mixed groups i can't this week because um you know i got my schedule the way my schedule's lined up i can't really really make anything i don't really have time for discipleship you know because i gotta go to work and you know my work if they fire me i don't have a job pastor and and so i'll stay a good convert i say a good convert the enemy every week you start coming he said oh look at her she's she there again trying it all out again trying to figure out what it is he's like cool let me throw let me make that phone call happen again because it has no root or she is trying to get rooted let me discourage her so she can find something wrong with our discipleship and relationship and blame it on the church because of her lack and his lack of growth and you wonder why only 25 of the church is powerful danny you can come take this and the bible says there's a small group a small group of people that really are the ones who can handle the pressures of this world we no longer have powerful christians that are walking through that are giving the testimony of jesus christ what we start is is with christians who are converts who have good ways but not changed lives let me tell you why most people don't walk into their giftings they'll blame that they don't have a place where their giftings can flow but the problem is is they haven't even done any of the pre-work so that their gift can even be recognized and an opportunity to walk through what point number one i want to give you is an opportunity to prepare when the holy spirit has entered in and we find ourselves in relationship with jesus what discipleship does is it prepares you it prepares you the bible says even for the works of servant it prepares you to be able to hold on to something anybody tired of giving up every time life gets hard anybody tired of letting go because it didn't work the way that you saw it to work in your mind but the problem is is you haven't spent any time with somebody who can tell you i just want to let you know it's going to be all right see we're living in a society that is so oriented on doing your own thing and having your own way that the way in which we think is that i can build my own self-salvation and the problem is is that you need community genesis lets us know that god said what it's not good that you be alone you're out here oh you're trying to wing it with no mentorship no discipleship i want to let you know that you need some folk that's over you as you're preparing this is what i believe god's called us to do in my discipleship i have people who pour into me people who are on my level that we exchange aren't sharpening aren't and people who i'm pouring in to three levels of discipleship i'm being poured into i am exchanging with someone else as we sharpen arm with one another and now i am finding others who are coming into the faith as beginning christians to be able to pour into the commission is for followers of jesus to go into the world and make disciples the question is have you ever been challenged on making disciples or you out here living life so grand that you have no ability to disciple anybody because you're just a convert it's a little sharp i know it is but we can have a powerful church if we had disciples with relationship we have people that are trying to stay out of hell with conversion but not living up the life so guess what most of the church is getting picked off by the thorns and the birds and the hot sun and it leaves only a small group of people left to be able to fend against the enemy in the hand of satan so now you have a few people praying over you binding the devil there going over here and setting the captive free and he says what the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few why because no laborers are disciples it's the church of christians but not followers and i'm interested in you becoming a follower because the best life that you can enjoy is a life that's totally submitted to the father and he wants to prepare you scripture lets us know in matthew chapter 4 verse 19 it says and he said to them follow me as my disciples accepting me as your master that means submission teacher which means i listen to what you're saying i hear the voice that you're speaking and it says and walking the same path of life i walk and i will make you right there i will make you why because you can't make yourself he says the responsibility of forming you and creating you and taking your purpose and potential to the next level is what i am forming you in the way that god has called for you to be i will make you just ask your neighbor real quick is god making you he was like no i ain't actually no i'm not i'm not i don't want to hear he says i'll make you he told him fishes are men i'll make you i'll change you i'll form you i'll make you brand new but the question is is god making you the way god makes you is he begins to what prepare you somebody said prepare me and god's got to prepare anybody know about a good meal and a good meal if you really prepared the dish if you really prepare everything else what happens the meal is quick but you got to be able to do what prepare the thing is is god wants to prepare you for the work see we love the message of i'm walking into my season but we don't like the message of it's going to take time it's a season of preparation the bible says the disciples followed jesus at least for three years we trying to get you through three classes of growth track you're like i can't do it it's three sundays in a row bro my sundays you're messing up my brunch we don't like being inconvenienced but we want great results we want shifting power we want healing words we want god to manifest his presence in our life the problem is is i don't have time to build relationship and if i don't have time to build relationship i don't have time to know who he is and if i don't have time to know who he is i don't have time to know what he's saying that's why time with god matters so much you said the church was forcing me in devotions no we were trying to prepare you for discipleship so that you could hear the voice of the lord for yourself and so that you could stop being swayed by every broken and wrong and false prophet that's out here because you need a tickling of the ear i'm trying to help you fish for yourself for the things that god has for you instead of waiting for somebody to tell you what your purpose is well pastor what should i do are you asking me because you really want to change or are you asking me because the idea behind it is you can't hear from god god's calling to prepare you point number two god wants to enable you anybody i know that's enabled turn on some of you need to be turned on because you weren't living you were just existing when you came to know christ he enabled you and some of y'all slipped the enable button right back off he was like i'm ready to activate i'm ready to take you to the next level i'm ready to see you bear some fruit i'm ready to see you change live and he was like whoa whoa that's a little bit too much let's just enable that feature right now i'll use the minimum requirements for what it is that you have for me to do but i'm beginning today to let you know your purpose is crazy if your purpose wasn't crazy then the head space you would be in is that you will understand that i might as well just keep doing things the same way but there's something about that god wants to use you to do something more than you can imagine a thing and when someone says global world changer you look at them like they're crazy but something on the inside begins to say i think i think i think i can do that why because if the things inside of me could become what god actually says i am i can fulfill the purpose he's called for my life but the problem is i can't fulfill the purpose without the relationship and i can't do the relationship without time with god and without time with god i am a convert with no destination just there what you doing next week i don't know what do you want me to do and it's like no what is god speaking you were with him for eight days has he spoken or have you been too busy to hear him when i tell people pastor i want to be disciple you basically need to walk back up to him so you won't suffer no no no i just want to know god more you want a reading plan that's what you want you want something to keep you acquainted with scriptures enough so that you don't find yourself in a place where you feel good about who you are and you feel good about what you're doing but you still get to do you that's what it is i can continue to do me but hopefully not go to hell we out here gambling and god's like why when you just built relationship with me he'll enable you john 15 16 says this you do not choose me but i chose you you did not choose me i chose you so stop thinking you were the one he says and appointed you that you should not that you will but that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide so that whatever you see you didn't know that benefit was in there for disciples the bible says for whatever you ask the father in my name he may give it to you the reason that you're not receiving what is for you is because you're not in relationship to understand what it is god has over your life so you need to be able and last but not least you need to be empowered discipleship will empower you i grew up as a kid i never forget i loved watching tv i'm an 80s kid so i know everything about the power rangers that came out i know everything about being empowered what would it do it would transform normal people into powerful people because of something that they had that no one else had they started going to a green ranger the black ranger but if you had another one i loved it if you had he-man he man was just swole but he had no fight in him but when that sword came and he was like i'm about to fight grace what is it uh uh grace caller yeah it's like without he's like when i'm about to do that or would i get empowered i'm going to tear everything up that's the idea because an empowerment enables you to do things that are on the inside of you that have not worked their way out but the problem is is we want to capture a thing and use it at our own preference and benefit when we want to and when the need is but god says in order for you to be empowered it's going to take some time and at the end you'll stand the test of time you won't fall you won't [Music] we find ourselves so indecisive with the things of god but so decisive with our finances with a house without career but when god says what's next we're like well i don't know we'll go to four years of college we'll go to 25 years of college we'll have eight degrees behind our names yet we don't know who we are [Music] today this is about who you're becoming the problem is is that if i'm not working in the place to become i'm just working in the place to exist and i don't want you to exist and have jesus that just doesn't speak well of the power that lies inside of you so i'm saying to you today and your discipleship lord help me to find someone that can pour into me someone that i can exchange with and help me to find someone i can pour into you are commissioned to be a disciple not a christian [Music] bible says in acts chapter one and eight but you will receive somebody say power [Music] when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in the city it says in all judea in our nation and it says in samaria and to the ends of the earth i just want to let somebody know today there's so much inside of you and there's so much purpose inside of you and it is more than you could ever imagine or think but if you sleep on god you'll never become who god's called for you to be can i tell you you're real good at your job but probably i just would love to see you be real good at your life [Music] pastor why you preach this message today because i believe that god is calling us to be disciples i'll give you a really great one i'll shout you know i'll give you everything i'll keep you woke but the problem with church is that church is way too much more about entertaining you than it is about growing you and the struggle that we work off of is we don't know how to grow so we just keep coming back for a fix and i'm here today to let you know relationship with god will settle your spirit when everything is breaking loose that you have no control over today i believe that you can stand the test of time danny real quick last but not least and the bible says when you spend time in discipleship it lets you know that seed will bear fruit the question today is are you bearing fruits because if you bear fruit you'll see the results i pray today that i not convict you with the holy spirit to do you see the results of your relationship with god in your life or has it done nothing but benefit you to be more prosperous in the things of your life
