foreign let's jump into the word of God we're on week three of how do I know how do I know how do I know and I believe that God's speaking Genesis chapter 3. so if you can take out your your phones take out your pin your paper one of the things that um is so helpful is when we can go back and go and look over things that have been said things that God has been speaking some things you'll write today that will be for the next season of where you're going some things you're writing right now you're going to find in your notes at the right time at the right season when you need it and you're going to remember God was saying this and speaking this on your heart so I want you to get connected in to what God is doing Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 through 9. we're going back to the beginning we're going to start at verse one those of you that are online love for you to get that Bible in your hand as we read together we believe God is going to speak to all of us it says now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made he said to the woman did God actually say you shall not eat of any tree in the garden and the woman said to the serpent here's the problem too many times we're having a discussion with the Enemy about what God Said the only thing that the enemy is trying to do to speak to you is make you doubt what God has already spoken over your life the Bible says and a woman said to the serpent we we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden but God said You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden neither shall you touch it if we if we go back and look at Genesis there is nowhere where we hear God say don't touch the tree see when you're tempted you start adding narratives to the things that you want so that you can have an escape for why you did what you did but the sermon said to the woman you you will not surely die the enemy is good at mixing truth with lies everything he says is not actually always wrong it's just that when he speaks he speaks with deception in his mouth says so the woman he said this for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you'll be like God knowing good and evil so when the woman did what saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate and she also gave to her husband who was with her and he ate then the eyes of both were opened they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together I don't know what kind of fig leaves and I'm not sure what sewing kit that they had [Music] they said they sewed the Fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths and they heard the sound of the Lord anybody ever been there before when you were doing something you know you shouldn't have been doing and you heard the sound of the Lord anybody ever been there before and you heard and may not have been the direct sound of the Lord but it was Pastor Marcus saying you bet not since I heard the sound of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord I want to let you know the enemy's biggest goal is to get you out of the presence of God [Music] if he can remove you here's what happens you stop hearing God's voice you stop knowing what God is saying and you start listening to the voice of the enemy [Music] he says the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden but the Lord God called because God doesn't care that you're trying to hide you're his and he so he's going to find you and it says the Lord got called to the man and said to him I need you to underline that that's really important he didn't say to them he said to him there's responsibility to the man because God spoke the Commandment to the man he didn't ask for don't I want to tell you real quick when when accountability comes God isn't searching for y'all God's searching for you I know you think y'all messed up but I want to get this Clarity and understanding God isn't searching for a group of people God said I was searching for Adam I'm searching for him tell your neighbor real quick God's searching for you this this is known there's no collaborative you know what I mean God we mess up no no the Bible says he was looking for the man and God Called To The Man and said to him where are you I want to come from the topic today Love Changes Everything Love Changes Everything can we pray father today we thank you and we are so grateful for this moment that we have I prayed today that God we could just flowing your presence to know your will to know your way [Music] and for the things we don't know that we would wait on you we pray your guidance be in this moment open our eyes that we may see and open our ears that we may hear but don't leave us to just be heroes of your word allow us to be doers Jesus name somebody say Amen amen amen God bless you musicians can y'all give it up for the best worship team in the world and then help me celebrate our Dream Team here at the mix it was 1999 no it was 2 000 and seven or eight I remember this 2007 or eight now I remember that my wife and I started to date we we we we started dating and connecting and and anyone knows in the dating in the connection stage you're trying to evaluate the prospects of the person that you are interested in to see if they meet the credentials and the values of what it is you believe what be good for you as an individual now I want to say this to you because they're in the time of evaluation there there's a lot of things that happen but to be honest many times in this dating and the pursuit season we don't always give 100 percent of Who We Are anybody ever been there before when you when you when you're dating you you you fix yourself up for the best presentation nobody goes on a job interview to tell them how they got fired you go presenting your best self and and that's what we do on a date we we go and present our best self we put on the best cologne it was the one that wasn't the sample we really put on the one that they got us and we and we and we dress up and we put on the best and and we pull out our best because I want you to see the best side of me I want you to see me at my best uh fellas you go get your hair cut you make sure you're you're sharp you make sure that you put so much cologne on that no one can breathe you I mean when you you got listen listen listen you are making sure the car is washed the the seats are buttered down with the with the fresh I mean the fresh Shea looking uh uh you you you you got the Polish the double wax on it you you got the playlist waiting for when they get in the car to make sure that it's the right tone that's setting and everything is where it needs to be the windows a crack just enough to make sure there's a fresh Breeze while the air conditioner is all like a hotel to make sure that the smell is good trying to set you up if this was 2007 if you if you were like me and any of my friends we we had in hanging in the car that black ice that made you dizzy because it was so strong [Applause] you would get beside yourself and you would make sure things were as perfect as possible 2007 my wife and I we begin to date and we begin to understand what it is like to have a blended family and our daughter goes out with us on a good Saturday because when you're dating you you can't separate from each other you know how it is you start dating someone you're excited y'all y'all y'all I mean y'all got plans every Friday and Saturday I mean every Fri y'all spending money that you didn't even know you had because you're trying to make a good impression you we we spend this Saturday together and my wife is from the west side and I was like listen I need to bring you to the east side y'all see where y'all at church right and so I bring her over and I I want to show off because I like Hey listen I got the cars fresh them all I'm trying to tell you it's laid out the mats are clean when you get in you put your feet on you can slide because there is so much oil on that mat that you could almost break your leg I'm trying to tell you that thing is together I've got my new car it's all fresh and looking and I'm making the best impression I said let's go get some snowballs because I want to show you how we do snowballs over here when you understand the sides of Baltimore you will really claim that whatever is on your side is the best [Applause] it can be the same corn syrup that's on west side and east side but you're gonna claim yours is the best these are the best snowballs or the best marshmallows with everything you could possibly I'm trying to tell you is crazy and so we do we go to the snowball place it and we all get the Snowballs and baby girl has to snowball and we get in the car foreign [Applause] and I look to the back seat very quickly I said sweetie do you have it or her very wonderful light voice to say yes I have no reason to doubt her but my singleness tells me if my car gets messed up I am going to lose it we are all happy because we got great snowballs y'all I'm talking about a good egg custard with some good good marshmallow on it y'all know sitting on top and you just can't wait but the problem is is the fact that you can't wait means that there's a possibility that things could go downhill King and what I should have asked for was a lower amount with a lid on the top we get to a speed bump [Music] I'm carefully riding over it but the Bible says the enemy comes in like a flood and I believe that either the window of the Lord or some Spirit not of God came through that fresh crack in the window that I tried to leave and all I know was I heard sorry [Applause] immediately I paused sorry for what all I know was that in five seconds baby girl had emptied the contents of the cup and it wasn't because she ate it it was on the floor I stopped the car put on the hazard lights and got out and said oh my goodness we gotta get this up oh my why would oh my I start to be me [Applause] you get what I'm saying but before that I wasn't really me I was a I was a piece of me but I wasn't a whole me I was I was giving you the best part of me but the real me somebody say the real me the real me came out when the real meat came out I started to look right in the wild why would you go oh my you can't hold on to a cup immediately my wife neck turned she wasn't my wife at that time and she said she's just a kid so she storms out the car and starts cleaning the back up well you know from there I had to make a decision what will I do I get out unable to change my face but to try to change my actions I get in and and I start cleaning out because they gave me those napkins but they gave me the cheap napkins the one says this thing y'all it's dinner and then what I can even imagine it's not even this thing it's this thin and I go to clean it up which means you need 75 of them to get up one spill I'll finally get it up you know there's there's snowball all in your hand and I throw a snowball out and I've got a trash bag in the car because of my OCD so it's hanging off y'all know the gear shift don't act like y'all don't know hanging off the Gish if I put it in there and I put it away and the rest of the ride just like this a wife say you act like it won't come up I said I don't think you understand how shame pulling works from there we begin to show the part of Who We Are when things aren't perfect when when things aren't as perfect as they need to be we we we we we we begin to shift and change it and to show the pieces of us because here's the thing that we left with last week which is you're not perfect as much as I want it to look perfect and put it all together you're not perfect and so I had to learn what it was like to have mistakes happen that I could not control because I like to think out everything to avoid as many mistakes as possible but here's the problem you can't control love you can't control it you can't control how the other person is going to act you can't control the way that they're going to think all you can do is hope with time that the two will become one But It's Tricky because most of the time we're trying to manipulate to into one and the preference is is not that two individuals would become one the preferences is I want you to be like I want you to be Adam's sitting in the garden doing what God has showed them to do the Bible lets us know that God has commanded Adam as he has brought him out of the Dust of the ground the Bible says that he gives Adam the responsibility of working The Garden of Eating Eden and caring for it which means the protection of the land he has given man the responsibility of working the garden the Bible says as woman comes along the man sees like listen it's not good that you're by yourself so in context Adam is operating and moving and and the Bible says he the Lord God creates the animals out of dust but he does not breathe the breath of life into them and when he creates them he he has Adam name all of it so here's a context that you have to get the Lord respected Adams Dominion in the earth somebody say Dominion he respects respected Adam ingion in the in the that was the name the Lord didn't go back he didn't ask he didn't say well you think that was a weird one you want to try that again he said whatever he named them however he used Adam and purposed him to move he called him to do so the Bible lets us know woman comes out of the rib of man and and and and and Adam's responsibility is to give the instruction that God has spoken to him to the woman the Bible says a woman comes and understands that there are trees that are amazing in the garden anybody ever ever ever been to a apple uh uh uh Orchard or anybody ever seen the blossom of trees when they when they come into the springtime they look amazing they're beautiful the Bible lets us know these are the best trees that have ever been made yeah this is the Garden of Eden this is I mean amazing uh and the Bible tells us that gee God tells them he says this hey I'm going to sit a tree in the middle of the garden but you can have every thing else just don't touch that that was the beginning of parenting if anybody has a child you know you can buy your child everything in the world but you say don't touch that I got a little grandson we got things all over the house but we tell them don't touch the socket don't go down steps what do y'all think he likes doing I mean he looks at that thing like you mean that you don't want me to touch that this socket right here because there is something about the sin nature that is born within us that always creates this desire for the things that are not best for us the Bible gives us a Clarity and understanding that the serpent comes and speaks to Eve and as he speaks to Eve he spreads alive with the truth and he kind of merges it together and here is the problem is that while Adam has always been in the place where he has been obeying God and getting instruction when you have someone in your life that's not at the point of life where they can hear God properly the enemy will speak to the individual as a follower of Jesus Christ who is not connected with the spirit of the Lord to use them as an influential person to deviate the purpose and the plan that God has over your life because they saw it was desirable for them the Bible lets us know that Eve saw it and thought it was desirable here's oftentimes what I see in a lot of relationships even before marriage hits there is one person as a Christian who is seeking after God and there's another person lying dormant in their relationship the dormant person is saying we don't need to do all that it's not that necessary that we pray it's not that necessary that we don't have sex before marriage it's just being extra you doing too much we love each other and because we love each other it gives us the right to disobey what God has said because Love Changes Things anybody know when you're in love you start making up your own rules I mean y'all just be honest you start creating your own scenarios your own rules you you you you you you you you abridge versions of things you've never read before you now have become a theologian and your Bible days that God didn't really say that can you find it I mean in the bible really clear because when we're seeking for our own will we come out of the presence of God and we listen to the ear of the enemy we hear him speak and we say you know what that sounds good because what he says to you can can I be honest real quick what he says to you to someone that is in the pursuit season he says to you you know nobody in the world is actually abstaining you're like I know that's just crazy that's that's archaic they need to get with today's culture and the issue is is that because you don't understand Kingdom culture you choose the world's culture as your standard of living and you miss the opportunity of what God wants to do in a healthy relationship so I find a lot of people when they're getting to the point where they're engaged and about to get married you know what happens they're at the point of no return I feel committed to this so now I have to I've been in plenty of moments where I've told somebody I just want to say this to you real quick I'm not sure if this is going to work if you want to be honest you when people come to marriage counseling they're not coming to counseling to be counseled they're coming to counseling to go through the process to do whatever it is that they want to do they just want me to bless it listen I like them they like me it don't matter what our lives look like can you just bless it because my blessing is going to override your disobedience and I'm here today to let you know you could have all the blessings that God has for you if you could stay Within his command the Bible tells us real quick that we we get to this point and and we start noticing that Eve is hearing from that and she hears she hears from Satan and the Bible tells us that she eats of the fruit she eats the fruit y'all because the enemy speaks to her about what she needs she eats the fruit and then the Bible says she gives it to her husband and guess what he did y'all have messed everything up [Applause] and I'm not talking about women I'm talking about the whole team you'd inject it all up just because you did not understand God's plan and God's purpose here's what I want to bring Clarity to Pastor are you saying because we messed up we can't be successful you can be highly successful here's what I want to tell you it's going to take work somebody say work I want to let you know love is work it's not feelings it's not your Netflix rom-com that you looked at last night where everybody got together and at the end they broke up but you knew they were going to come back together at the end and you're sitting there crying in the middle of it talking about I knew they were going to get back together I was just waiting some of you are even good if you're like me I go down and look at the seasons to see when they get to let me click right here and get it see I knew they were going to get together I knew it was going to happen and we think that's the way life unfolds but the problem is is when you get into a relationship and moving to the place of marriage y'all it gets real tell your neighbor real quick it gets real so real which is what you think and who you are and you've got to make a decision that as it gets real can I handle this because some of us are taking the next step to get into a marriage based off of what we hope they will be which they are not yet and you're building a relationship off of what you think will change but the problem is what if they don't change can you handle who they are now that's when we start using that word you know they good they're a good person [Applause] they're good person it's the identifying that they're a good person in the attributes that you see for what you think you need at the time you think you need it but you know there's a lot more work that has to be done and some of us have proposed to the person of the future not the person of the present and then you get into the relationship and want to tell me a year in Pastor it ain't what I thought we know we saw it then let me tell you something what happened my wife and I when when we started dating she was going to church somewhat and um [Applause] no for real y'all know that somewhat you know we talked about this last week that Easter boyfriend that Easter girlfriend that come you and we had Easter and you sitting there talking about Pastor me and I'll be like me who they ain't been here all year how long I've been together two years okay first of all why are you hiding this person but the context is that oftentimes we find ourselves in a place where where we're trying to keep things the same without changing them too much but the problem is you can't love someone without things changing because the thing about love is love is a choice that makes you change the direction of it being all about you and it has to change the perspective not about what you can get from it but also what you can give to it and the way in which you give to it is the opportunity for you to know that there's something greater there's something more there's something to look forward to but when I'm marrying on connecting with this person I want to let you know you right before you get married you are in the change season it's the season where you need to look to see where we're going am I willing to change to become one or am I saying I'm going to stay the same don't bother me you know I like looking at my Netflix show at eight o'clock you know I like eating dinner by six you know I don't go outside to restaurants you know I don't eat a whole lot of that you know I don't do and what we do is we say here's my list if you alter from it this ain't gonna work you you know how many times you have to compromise to really be in love oh my gosh trying to tell you it's real one of the things I told my wife I said here's the thing I go to church to be in my life you got to figure out if you want to go no no no this back in the day Church [Applause] y'all get that 90 minute boyfriend and girlfriend that can't handle 90. I'm talking about Bible study my kids are sitting on their back road like oh my God how long they gonna be in here we got Bible study we got youth night we got prayer my pastor said we got all night prayer I said all night all night sis if you can't handle all night prayer I ain't the person for you [Applause] Love Changes everything you gotta know who I am and the issue is if I don't know who I am I don't have a true person to give you with the standards that come with my life some of us compromise in the relationship but are trying to set the standard in the marriage and there's something that you thought that marriage was going to change because something about marriage makes me have to I didn't want to do it before and I don't want to do it now it's not going to change it but the issue is when I don't know who I am I'll compromise because I think that's what love does it compromises for the broken pieces and only gives to the things that we want now you built a relationship where you've got to keep up with this person's preferences because preferences are the only thing that keep you from arguing if I do what you tell me to do we good here's one thing you need to figure out top of your marriage top of your relationship you're about to take the next stage tell somebody no no no no yeah y'all not get what I'm saying tell see when you are in the chain season you are doing everything that person wants you to do I'm interested what the relationship looks like when you say no you coming over tonight no I'm tired you don't love me no yes [Applause] because now you're creating an expectation that every time that I speak and make a request your responsibility is to answer to what I want and it is an unhealthy relationship I've set up stuff I've created things I'm in this place where it's like well whatever you want me to do now here's what I want to tell you somebody on one side of that thing is feeling weighted down because now they always have to answer because in your stay season you lack communication when someone told you no you dropped them you remember him no we're not going to Ruth Chris for the third time this week I don't need no broke brother broke you're going to Ruth Chris and you don't even eat me the idea that we have in the change season is to consider what it is that's going to change what has to change for this to actually work I don't want to be a man that's controlled by an emotional relationship where there's a lack of communication a lack of empathy and a lack of being able to express my voice without it being felt as if I'm the issue in the relationship I want to be the gentleman that can express where I am but we have the ability because we're mature enough not to get in our feelings and stay there until somebody breaks we're at a communicating state that we have the ability to be able to say to who we are this is not something I prefer but let somebody say talk about it we need to learn how to talk about it not mute about it not sigh about it not roll our eyes about it not go downstairs in the basement about it [Music] not turn on Netflix about it we need to learn to communicate because if we don't communicate with it then we find a substitute we oh the enemy is real good at putting in a substitute when you are angry and that's your rough point I'm trying to tell you people come out the woodwork like roaches when you turn on a light you can think you're the only one you can think nobody else would think but I want to let you know when things happen the enemy says oh I'll take this thing out because he understands the potential that if both of you are in alignment with God's Will and God's purpose you could change the world but if I could create Division if I can have her text you at 10 o'clock at night just to say hey what's going on I can change everything [Applause] so the first thing we've got to understand because Love Changes Everything is that your life belongs to God your life belongs to God your creator your king your savior the one who restored you the one who changed you the one who healed you the one who minded your mind together when it was just as Loose as loose can be the God who came in right on time when you didn't even have the opportunity to be able to call on his name that god Jehovah the one who provides for you the one who is over all things sees all things who intervenes when you mess up and when you're thinking out of your emotions and not out of the spirit The God Who is a sustainer the God who moves and interrupts all flows of nature just on your behalf The God Who shows favor when you don't even deserve favor that God your life belongs to him First Corinthians lets us know I just want to tell you real quick that you were brought with a price you were bought the price so you belong to God the problem here is Adam forgot he belonged to God there should be oh can I be real honest about it there should be attention if you're getting married between a husband and a wife he's like Pastor what there should be attention between what God Said and what you see I'm gonna tell you real quick a husband with a vision a man of God with a vision is locked in to what God has said go into the garden work it and protect it care for it all right that's what you say you said that great great okay go over and name every and whatever you name it it shall be do not eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil got it got it got it so honey real quick let me run what God has said to me to give to you so that I can direct and take my family to where we're supposed to go so I want to let you know during the day I will be in the garden I will be working I will be making sure that the garden is secure and that the ground is still no hold on don't speak yet just let me get it out second thing is that God called me to be able to name every animal and make sure that the names according to the way he called me to name them would stick and I'll be able to do that so I just want to let you know that's what God called me to do number three God has spoken and said do not touch the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's what God said to me let me share that with you the enemy comes in to speak a different version of the vision to see if the man can really hold the foundation for where you're going because it means there must be a man of faith to understand hey babe you want to go no God told me to do was to work in the garden name the animals and don't touch the tree but you know them Beyonce tickets went on sale and [Applause] but that's not in the budget oh that there was a plan that God gave me and the plan that God gave me was to take our family to is it a possibility that you have diverted God's plan because you were more interested in what you wanted than what God spoke the enemy came in and said you let me tell you something you make your own money you don't have to ask nobody who he thinking you don't have to act nobody you go make your money and buy them tickets and you divert the plan because you didn't hear from the Lord and you forgot what was spoken the Bible says she desired by what she saw she went as she saw and when she saw she ate and gave to her husband he forgot he belonged to God he forgot the close connection with God he forgot that he could hear when God was walking through the garden he forgot he was hearing directly from the voice of God Roman says this 8-38-39 it says I'm absolutely convinced that nothing living or dead Angelic or demonic today or tomorrow high or low thinkable or Unthinkable absolutely nothing can get between us and God's love because of the way that Jesus our master has embraced us you got to remember today nothing is going to separate me from him anybody ever just been at a point where you just got to say enough is enough now nothing's going to say I love you I just want to let I love you but nothing can separate me because my life belongs to God [Applause] if your life belongs to God I want to let you know that your heart want to belonging to your spouse and that's the problem is that many of us think with our heart and not with what God has spoken into us we're like you know what I feel can I tell you today if you're living your marriage out of what you feel you will have the greatest roller coaster of your life and here's what I want to tell you people who are so numb to feeling that you don't even care anymore because you've been hurt you will never receive or be able to give the love that God has called for you to give here's what you're going to do you're going to find someone that makes a good business partner some of us are relationships that are good business partners how much you make well I make that too all right so what assets do you have oh that's good I got good assets too how many degrees great love it where you where you think you're going to be in two years awesome I was looking at the same thing what I feel is that we're compatible not in spirit in assets and we could build a good life together if we keep this going well because here's what it means I don't have to change anything and if Love Changes Everything then that means there's a possibility that there's an unequal point of view in the assets but there's a makeup in the individual and because of who I am see me in three years because of what God is going to do I promise you I will surpass anything that you think or believe when my wife got with me I ain't gonna lie to her I'm not sure why it was on the assets end Ed up sets you know what I mean there was no sets I didn't even have sets to here's the thing just because a person doesn't have or has the assets doesn't speak to the character of who they are that's nothing to do with it great great you got great shoes big house wonderful things and assets your car is dope but it does not speak to the value of who your character is because if your character was on point those things don't even matter when it comes to understanding who God is placing you with so that you can what change the world you gotta look at the person that you're trying to get connected with in life and be like I just need to know are you a world changer I'm I'm not interested in how much you can acquire I'm not interested in how many more shoes you can get I'm not interested in how many more houses you can buy it is a very fleeting thing because here's what I want to let you know one sickness one moment can change everything and all the value that you put into the assets that you have will diminish immediately and now you're stuck with the person that was full of things but empty of character [Applause] now what you gonna do with the car now what you're gonna do with the bedroom now what you're going to do with the bank account that means nothing right now but because there was a lack of character because the enemy kept speaking because this tension was in our marriage that we didn't talk about there are some tensions you can't resolve there are moments when I walk up to my wife and be like so God said this and she'd be like today men you need to have a godsend moment when's the last time God spoke to you about you and your family that it built attention between you and your wife when's the last time God told me I didn't I didn't hear God say I didn't hear God say that I didn't hear him did he say you sure he's let me pray on let's see if he says it together [Applause] this is what God Said this is listen we moved not too long ago I walked in the house and said hey sweetie she said hey I said I just want to let you know I'm moving you're coming with me let's go she was like out of our house I said yes I've already called the realtor we go on the market in a week she said wait what I said it's time for us to move God showed me that she said I just got here I said do you trust me do you trust over the years that the leading of the holy spirit that you've seen evident in my life not from what I've purchased not from what our credit scores look like but have you seen the move of the holy spirit in my life actively moving to let you and I know that God resides in me and when he speaks he speaks to me and you can believe in what he says she said yep I can I said all right let's start packing because God's called us to move foreign we moved into a house and my wife said that's what happened on the next one she said you don't even need to tell me the next time we move you don't even need to let me know when we put a house up just put it up or whatever house you choose I'll go with it why because there is something about the trusting word of God that when you speak out of time with him there can be a trust here's where I'm going to tell you division comes division comes when neither one of you are hearing from God and you both are giving your opinions to the purpose of your marriage your relationship and where you're going nobody hears from God everybody has an opinion if we're not hearing from God then where are we hearing from I'm just trying to tell you next time you go to Ruth Chris sit down at that table and be like do you hear from God when's the last time God spoke to you when's the last time God has I mean put the challenge on have you heard from God what do you believe God is saying because if so you'll be able to repeat it back but here's what I believe God is speaking proverbs 31 10-11 says this a good woman it's hard to find I got any good women in the place [Applause] okay we need to bring this support up of confidence within ourselves let's do this one more time do we have any good women in the place okay [Applause] somebody you're like well you need to ask the other question mind your business I'm on this scripture the Bible says a good woman is hard to find and we're far more than diamonds I don't know if you know about Diamond Excavating but Diamond Excavating means that you are taking a lot of time and a lot of hard work to find something that is so precious lying in an area in a space that you're unsure if you'll find it but once you find it you understand the worth is greater than the diamonds of this world what God is saying is when you find a woman of God when you find someone who understands God's purpose and God's plan who is able to understand the voice of the man it's just that I'm trying to tell you it's the best thing in your life I work far more than diamonds and it says and her husband trusts her without Reserve and never has reason to regret it today we saying we got good people but can you trust them we saying we got grateful but can you trust him and then our last part is your purpose belongs to God your purpose your purpose belongs to you I want to tell you this your purpose belongs to you because many of you are thinking right now that God has relented on his promise and I want to let you know the purpose that God has already said over your life is in your hands you just got to figure out are you ready to walk in it you got to figure out are you ready to fulfill everything that God has spoken over your life that he has not canceled that he has not voided but that he has spoken the reason that the enemy is trying to do everything to steal kill and destroy because he knows that if you get a hold of Abundant Living if you get a hold of a life where every night you're not wallowing and what it feels like is a depression that is overwhelming if you could live out a life where you've got some peace where the fruits of the spirit are coming up in such a way that you could not even imagine if you could live a life where your purpose could be fulfilled you would see things more than you can imagine a thing I want to tell you this today you have everything you need somebody to tell your neighbor real quick you have everything you need you've got everything you need to fulfill everything that God has said the Bible lets us know it says this in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27-28 it says and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves in the earth God has already declared what he has called you to have dominion over God has already declared that your home is blessed God has already declared that your family is blessed God has already declared that everything that your foot shall touch that shall be yours you shall acquire it but the thing is if you don't understand the purpose belongs to you you will never take Dominion to watch it fulfilled in your life you got to take a hold of your life and say I will not live this way anymore I will not operate this way anymore I will not let someone else or other things dictate what God has already spoken and said over my life when God gave me before he gave me you was a yes and an amen so why I'm gonna walk in it's a fact in understanding that God will fulfill his promise in my life today at the end of our reading it says that the Lord ask a question that we don't see at the beginning of Genesis anywhere it says that he asked the man he says where are you y'all think God lost the location on the man anybody think God just I can't find them so many trees in here I can't see he never asked the question where are you but why did God ask this question because something had changed in the man's faith something clicked that wasn't supposed to click something was different and here's the question that God asked where are you my question today is where are you what is taking place in your life what has happened what has moved in you that has changed your faith that as God's man and woman that it's changed your vision that you stop believing and you stop hoping you stop understanding what changed can I ask the question where are you are you still holding to the promise that God has spoke over your life are you still walking in the season of what God has spoken and declared for you or have you found yourself fading away with the cares of this life and the Lord is asking where are you he's not trying to find your location he's trying to find your faith [Music] I want to let you know today Love Love Changes a lot but it doesn't change your purpose and it doesn't change God's plan today the love that God has for you and that he's called you to as a love that will change your life for the good the scripture says he's working all things out for the good
