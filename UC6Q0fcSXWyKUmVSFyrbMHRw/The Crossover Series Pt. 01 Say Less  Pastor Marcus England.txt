[Music] we're going to dive into the word of god and we're going to move to exodus chapter 14 and we're going to start at verse 10 and i'm really grateful for just what god's word is going to do in us today i've been saying these three things that god wants to do something for you that god wants to do something through you and that god wants to do something in you and i believe his work can do all of these things exodus chapter 14 verses 10 and we're going to go to 18 and we're going to read today in god's word the bible lets us know when pharaoh drew near it said the people of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians in whom they were in slavery to were marching after them it says and they feared greatly and the people of israel cried out to the lord they said they said to moses is it because there are no graves in egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness what have you done to us in bringing us out of egypt i just want to give you clarity these people are complaining during their deliverance it says is not this what we said to you in egypt leave us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it would have been better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the wilderness and moses said to the people fear not stand firm and see the salvation of the lord which he will work for you somebody say today for the egyptians whom you see today you shall never see again i believe that is a word of prophecy and deliverance in the house that god is speaking there are some things that you see today that you will see no more the lord will fight for you and you will have only to be somebody say silent the lord said to moses why do you cry to me tell the people of israel to go forward and he told moses he said lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it i believe that god is calling for you to stretch out your hand over some things in your life and speak to those things and watch those things move to where god has called for them to be and it says and that people of israel may go through the sea on dry ground in a state of a miracle and i will harden the hearts of the egyptians so that they shall go in after them and i will get the glory over pharaoh and all his hosts his chariots and his horsemen the last verse and it says and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord and when i have gotten glory over pharaoh his chariots and his horsemen somebody say amen to the word of god i want to come from the title this morning say less say less i'm here to talk about sayla some of us are talking too much god is saying say less i i want to pray today and just believing god is going to allow this word to enter into our hearts uh to do something for us through us and in us father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that your word is here to change who we are so help us not to just be hearers of your word but help us to be doers of that word for we want to know you more and more knowing that as we seek after you in your righteousness everything that we desire in our hearts according to your purpose and plan will be added unto us we love honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen online say amen we are so grateful thank you so much musicians and i am so grateful for at the top of this year those people who said they love me truly love me are part of our dream team because that's the only way they could stay with me into a new year and believing the vision of what god has called for us to do can you help me celebrate our dream team this this wonderful morning i'm believing that god is is is really trying to do something great in us and through us and i believe this year that god is calling to get our attention i i've said this very clearly that i believe that the lord is saying a word to us is to have an expectation of what he wants to do for us on today i don't care whether you're in person or if you're online i want you to have an expectation of what god wants to do in your life today without a level of expectation there is nothing to look forward to and if you have nothing to look forward to you have nothing to pray for if there is something about understanding that the clarity of vision is not about just having a destination to get to but the clarity of vision is about understanding that god is not through with you yet that he has somewhere to take you here's what i do believe in this year that god wants us to say less and do more say less and do more we we we have this uh uh oftentimes this this direction in our mind that we're oftentimes putting ourselves in the place where we're saying a lot but we're not doing as much as we are saying we're we're we're talking a lot we're we're giving resolutions of where we want to be where we want to go what we want to do how we want to get there but the problem is is that faith in itself requires there to be what's called an action for the bible lets us know that faith without works movement the idea of going somewhere is dead and so that's why in 21 days of prayer and fasting we're asking you to trust god through prayer and do something in accordance with that prayer which is what fasting and so we're actually putting an activation until what we believe to know that god is going to exceed our expectations now what i i think is really important for you to understand is that god is interested in what you're saying but he's also interested in what you're doing and he wants you just to be able to grasp a hold of what he says the first time somebody say the first time yeah god is not interested this year in repeating himself because he's already been repeating whatever it is that you're waiting to hear he didn't just repeat it in 2022 but god has already been speaking this in 2021 and 2020 and before he's just waiting for you to listen to what it is that he is speaking to you i don't know if some of you understand or are like me but i i tend to have an anxiousness about me that i i want to do before sometimes i listen to you know i have a i have an issue about instructions that when i think i know something i go ahead and do it and then i have to go back and correct my mistakes because i didn't listen to instruction first now i i'll never forget uh my wife and i we were on vacation together and and and when we're on vacation i like to do um i don't like to sit in just the sun and the beach because already my pigmentation has received its coloring as much as it's needed now others of you like my wife that you you you want a tan you want some other complexities and complexions to you but for where i am god has told me that's enough all right and so i don't just sit out in the sun and i don't get an enjoyment by being by the pool for eight and nine hours and and so we have to compromise y'all know you we we gotta compromise my wife can stay at the beach and and enjoy herself and i'm just sitting there saying god please i need to do something so we made a decision to go out on an excursion and in this excursion i want to let you know is that i was uh real amped up to do some atv driving now i want to give you an idea and clarity you would think because i am from east baltimore that uh i have been on a four-wheeler and that's called judgment no i have not rode up and down the streets of baltimore doing uh wheelies no i have not been on a dirt bike no that is not what my mama allowed me to do she said stay in the alley and don't go any further than past our neighbor's house so i didn't get the opportunity to do the whole four-wheeler expedition but i got to when we went away and i was so excited that we we had the part of it where we were on we were uh grabbing in and we we were dealing with these monkeys and if you've ever looked at my page you see these these little animals are all over us and we're having a fun time and and i'm saying this is cute but i want to get to the real thing you know i want to get to having some fun and and we move next to the atv driving in and anybody knows especially from the male side is when you think you know you pay very little attention to the instructions that are given to you now we sat in an instructional class that let us know what we are to do and how we're not to do certain things and if you do certain things it could break the the automobile and if you break the automobile this is how much it cost and and and and so in the process they gave us a paper that basically waived them being responsible i don't even think i looked at the paper i said sweetie hurry up and sign it and give it back because i wasn't concerned with what could happen i was concerned about what i would get the ability to be able to do when they said it's time to go i got up i think i passed my wife maybe i left her and i ran straight to the closest atv in the front two guys got in front of it i said that's fine i'm gonna be on their tail just like i am in the streets of baltimore and so i i get in this atv and and we find ourselves locked in and and and i buckle up and i'm ready to go i've got my little mask on my face and i've turned it on i don't need instructions i i've got this anybody ever said this i i got this and and so i got this my wife gets in and and i'm like you good and she's like i'm good and she's like i i need to try to get this seat belt on i don't see where my side is i said well you better hurry up because when i press it on the floor whoever's with me is with me you better lock the gate shut it and let's go well we turn it on and we start movements babe they didn't say go yet i said i just want to take make sure our minds is working so let me test it ahead of time we get in and and it's time to go and the gentleman has to tell me he said put your helmet on i said come on man i don't want to put no helmet on i'm just ready to go i get ready to go and i put my helmet on it and we snap up and and i told my wife i said here's the phone i need you to record everything that goes down she said no problem i got this as soon as we started we belt out and it's on i'm talking about serious terrain y'all we are driving at high speeds there are dips there are puddles of mud everywhere i'm slamming on brakes turning in the corner my wife is jerking in the other side of the seat saying i think i'm getting sick i said well you better throw up in the mud because we aren't stopping this boat there were two requirements if you throw up throw up on the side and don't you lose my phone and what the third responsibility is don't you stop recording either he told us there's certain areas where you need to slow down so you don't flip over i didn't hear that initially there was a couple of times where we tilt it a little too far and i had to cry out the name of jesus but guess what i didn't stop can i tell you that god is trying to speak something into your heart and spirit that makes you so passionate and so anxious about him that all you want to do is start moving ahead with whatever it is he has set for your life you don't care about the dips you don't care about the turns you don't care about if you fall over you don't care about what happens because you're so inegriated and passionate about what god is doing that you'll say i'll risk my life just to experience life with you i'm here today to let you know is that what god was offering the people of israel was a freedom like never before and because of the instructions of what they thought could happen they got so afraid and so scared about what would take place that all they kept thinking about is what was instead of what could be how many of you in your life today you think about oftentimes what was instead of what could be it is it interesting that every time that you come into god's house is that god is trying to prepare you and give you a word that is going to exceed the level of what you even expected out of yourself and he's trying to tell you there's more but you're saying i'm safe where i am the problem is is like the children of israel is that we started to make a home in our slavery we started to make a comfort and a bed and and we started to build a home and we say regardless if i'm in oppression regardless if things are no better than they were i have made such a comfort of my life that i don't expect anything greater than what i had the ability to produce of my self and the bible lets us know that god has things in store for you that are greater than what you could ever expect of yourself so whatever it is that you are happy about that you did for you god is saying i have something greater an expectation of what i could do for your life that you haven't even imagined or thought today i'm interested in the comfort level that the enemy has been really good at creating for you that has made you so comfortable that god is not that needful in your life as long as you're comfortable enough with the praises of men and the ideas of success [Music] the praises of men is the ability for people to tell you how good you are at what you do and when you do it that gives you enough satisfaction that you're willing to settle at the ground level of someone speaking something whether it may be false or true just enough to settle you in your life that you would say i don't need to go any further i just really need to see the satisfaction of what this brings to me the problem is is that the praises of other people will go near and far very quickly and the idea behind it is that you will need to search for it again if your life has been built on what other people say about you then your life will need to continue on what other people say about you in order to go further in where you want to be so what you will notice is that your life will only move according to the amount of praise that you receive and when you get in your dark moments as david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death what happens is is that you stay in the shadow of death for so long because you're not getting the praise when things don't look the way that they need to look that you want to receive so it doesn't motivate you if your motivation comes through the praises of people you will find often that you will get the praise from the wrong people to give you the wrong motivation because the praise from the wrong people will be for their benefit to get you where they want you to be not for the benefit of you to get to where god has called for you to be and the wrong praise brings about the wrong return today some of us are oftentimes finding ourselves in the place where god is trying to get us out of our broken states into a place of deliverance and walking in freedom but we're still holding on to a broken idea of where we used to come the idea that i want to give you is the first point which is stop threatening your future with your past stop threatening your future with your past when you threaten your future with your past you you you make statements like this i was fine where i was which means you come to the conclusion that going backwards or where you were two and three years ago is a place where you want to go back to that brings benefit well you say pastor i want to let you know back then i was free obviously you weren't free if you think that you've been delivered out of it yet you want to go back to it the mentality is is that god has called me to something greater i i think this in the mindset is you will never believe in what's ahead if you can't let go of what's behind you will never believe in it i'll talk to you about destiny and you'll be like not for me i'll talk to you about what god is trying to do for you be like not for me you'll say i'll settle with just getting over and some of you have wrestled so much with your past that you say why didn't you just leave me in my bondage because my bondage is way more comfortable than me fighting for my future see here's the problem with destiny is that destiny will require you to fight for something your past will require you to stay where you are and the problem of moving forward which is point number two is that you don't understand the clarity of what god has for you ahead so you settle for what you're willing to produce and provide for yourself even though you don't understand how emotionally unstable you are with your own destiny if the days are according to how you feel anybody know you're going to wake up tomorrow feeling different than you woke up today and if you base your life on the presence of where you feel in the moment then what happens is is that you haven't already pre-planned the intentionality of what you want to see happen in your future you're basing it on today and you're basing it on the moment in which you feel and the moment in which you feel is not enough to speak to the destiny that's ahead here's what i want to be able to say to you in in the clarity of understanding is that when you're when you're so moved with your past that you keep using it as a reflecting point and not a learning point it becomes a savior and an option for you to go back to and its place of where it stands never gives you enough faith to believe in what's ahead so the idea becomes is that relationally you're finding yourself in the place where god wants to free you from brokenness but yet you still keep reaching back for what felt good because there aren't any other options available to you because there's no other vision for you to cling to if i don't have a vision of what to cling to then i'll settle for what i know and what you know is of your past the problem is is god is trying to move you forward god was trying to move israel forward so what happened was is is that he put the enemy on the opposite side of them that's why it said pharaoh was coming after them marching towards them and there was a red sea in front of them here's what i want you to get a little bit of clarity on is that the reason why the enemy is attacking you is because god situated it and allowed it to be so that either you will make the decision to go back to the misery that you're in and be defeated and destroyed or you would move forward ahead in faith believing that god delivered you for a purpose and a reason now here's what i want to let you know and give you some clarity and understanding too is that what's lying behind you is not to put you back into comfort what's lying behind you is back there to destroy you it's not there to give you comfort it's not there for you to be able to say well if i go back to this this is a place where i know if you go back you go back to a place that is called to destroy where you are going why go back when there's a future ahead the reason why your past is so stubborn the reason why your faith is being challenged is because when you look at your past all you tend to do is use it as a soother because of the fear that's being induced by an actual destiny and purpose ahead it's the inability to know what's clearly ahead that makes you stay where you are so you stay in your comfort lane of going back to the idea of what it would be like living in bondage and if i stay in bondage at least i know how to operate in it the problem is is that the enemy has made some of us a professional at brokenness so you you know how to operate in broken moments you know how to operate financially broken instead of you declaring financial wealth over your life and declaring that you're moving into a new position of where god has you and instead of moving into a direction where you just operate out of what taking from peter to pay paul you say instead of me spending won't i stop going back to the lane of comfort and when i move to the place of discomfort which requires me to do something opposite of what i know to do this is in every part of our life because we know how to operate in our broken spaces you know how to operate in your in security you know how to operate in your anxiety you know how to operate in your financial brokenness what truly scares you is the destiny ahead of you that requires you to learn something different than what you've been living out for the last years of your life and for some reason the enemy has convinced you enough that your destiny isn't worth the pain so won't you go back to egypt won't you go back to slavery won't you go back to the enemy telling you what to feel when to feel how to feel it won't you go back to a space where generosity isn't a part of your life and giving isn't a part of what you do and seeing lives transform isn't how you live go back to a place of where you operate where the spirit is selfishness because that's what you're used to here's here's the complexity and when we're praying the complexity in praying is that i'm believing god to do something in my life but the problem that i'm believing him for is that it's about me what if god used you to do something that didn't benefit your pockets would it still be the hand of god because god doesn't give vision for the sake of prosperity god doesn't give vision for the sake of how he's going to set your account up god doesn't give vision so that he can hope that you can stop feeling lonely god doesn't give vision so that you can live life feeling better without making an impact god gave you the vision and the clarity of what you're doing and who you're to become so that you can see the impact make a difference through kingdom principles let me tell you this real quick why because everything that god has called for you to do and operate is not to be absent of his presence so today as we start in 21 days of prayer you've got to start asking god what does the prayer look like god says i'm teaching you something god i give more than i receive that's because i am breaking the spirit of poverty and selfishness off of you and i'm teaching you to be generous and lighthearted and not to worry some of us are so overly needing a thing for a thing that the only way we operate is according to if we see it i'll be generous if i see the money i'll be consistent if they're supportive i'll give as long as someone is giving to me and god is trying to teach you how to be your own in him so that whatever he commands you to do it's not about the response in which you receive some of us only move according to what we get and then we give back out from the level in which we get when the bible lets us know it will be rewarded to you as you what give it well i don't want to be out here giving my heart to people because people hurt me so your seed is an absent seed of love which you're expecting a harvest to receive how do you expect a harvest from something that you have not planted a seed in the ground to receive i'm looking for prosperity but the problem is is that you haven't sown generosity i'm looking for god to impact my life in such a way that i can see other lives change well how about you start at the general level and be consistent and impacting someone else's life that's not about people praising you why because we'll set ourselves in position to do things for other for what we can receive back from it you know i want to help people move forward in their lives and break addiction why because there's money attached to it i want to help people in their relationships go further why because i want people to know how good i am i want i want to be able to to to give generously and see my name why so that other people know that i'm a giver no no what happens is whoever you are people will know it directly by what's inside of you not by what you're trying to declare outwardly to people that's a false manifestation of what you have not been freed from there must be deliverance and freedom in who you are in order to see the product of what can be manifested and what's truly who you can be so the problem that we run into is that i'm running after something and being obedient according to what it can give me a return on it goes against the principle of discipleship because jesus said if you follow me god knows what's going to happen that's my version of it he said the foxes have holes in the birds have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head this idea that the christianity of what god is supposed to do for me is about me following him and then in return him giving me what i want is a false representation of what we've been called to be and so now we're offended at god and people and the church and the pastor because you lied to me because i'm not seeing the product of what i want to see but the problem is is that you never sowed a heart of discipleship to god in the beginning to see him do for you what he does for his followers you're not a follower unless you what release yourself he says this unless you give up your life you'll never actually get it and we have false expectations of what we want to see god do because all we want to think about is where we used to be can i tell you that some of the greatest losses in your life is because you relied on your past instead of getting a new direction on your future and i'm speaking it today over somebody's life not here to convince you just here to let you know that there are some things that have gripped you that are wrong and you're living in them because someone told you that comfort was better than destiny so we've settled some of you have found yourself in the place like myself before where because you have obtained well only your mind could even think about you believe that god's done enough but the problem is is that you're so so far from where you were supposed to be that you don't notice that you're actually in disobedience because you're not where god says you're supposed to be what you've obtained is not meaning that you are in alignment with god it means that you had goals that you were consistent enough to go after that made a difference for you but the problem is is that you can't really move forward unless you understand where god says to move to the bible says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path if you haven't gotten direction then the path that you're on is probably a path of yourself and so today god is saying i want to give you direction in everything that you're supposed to do so that you can get to everywhere you're supposed to be when i release you then you'll understand there's victory behind it my question is is what is the red sea that's in front of you that you're unwilling to cross because you're so acquainted with your pain of your past that you don't mind going back why doesn't your past scare you more than your future the idea that i haven't reached to where god has called for me to do that scares me how far i could possibly be from my purpose that scares me how far i could possibly be from god saying well done thy good and faithful servant that scares me my last point that i want to give to you is point number three which is god wants the enemy to see your deliverance can i can i tell somebody in here that the cross was a gamble on you [Music] the cross said i'm going to put up this blood before i even see the results and i'm going to put my life out because i believe in accordance to how much i love you that my love will overcome all of your mess your brokenness your misunderstandings and what i'm declaring today through the cross is that i believe in you now before you're even born i believe in you now before you're even moving into your destiny that god was willing to gamble on you before you even got here and all he is doing is waiting for you to walk in the middle of that deliverance for the bible says as they begin to cross the red sea he hardened pharaoh's heart so that they would chase them in and here's what i'm saying to you whatever you are fearing to walk into god is saying i want to let you know today as you walk through it the enemy is still going to chase you but don't you worry about it because there's victory on the other side [Music] god will be glorified through your triumph god will be glorified through the moments of pain for the bible even lets us know for those who've lost he says you you shall be comforted when you mourn blessed are the can i tell you today there is no hurt that there is not a victory on the other side when you keep going can i tell you today that whatever it is that's holding you where you are can i tell you whatever today that you made the decision that i'm just going to park it right here and not move any forward i want to say to you today there is victory on the other side stop looking at the enemy behind because he does come to steal and kill and destroy and he is coming like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but i just tend to think there's a possibility that god looked at you and said have you considered my servant have you considered one who is upright and faithful god why am i going through so much because i want to show the victory on the other side i want to show the enemy he could not kill you even on your worst day i want to let you know that the enemy is speaking that even when things seem to be destructive i had you already in mind just keep moving forward and don't you allow what's behind you to keep you from the destiny of what god has declared over your life today [Applause] [Music] if he's willing to part the red sea then he's got to have a plan in mind if he's willing to make a way there he's got to have a plan in mind so i'm willing to walk according to his word and his purpose the enemy is behind you aren't you afraid yes i'm afraid but i'll keep moving forward because there's victory on the other side [Music] i don't have time to look at what's behind i don't have time to lament from where i came i don't have to talk about where where i used to be today i want to let you know that god is saying you are already victorious in the name of jesus well what if i get the urge you're already victorious in the name of jesus well what if things look bleak you're already victorious in the name of jesus just keep walking just keep moving forward just keep allowing god to use you just keep saying i'm more than a conqueror through him that loves me i am the head and not the tail i am above and not beneath i'm blessed am i going out and in my coming in it doesn't matter what it looks like i'm moving forward say less say less i don't have a whole bunch of talking to do say less i'm moving forward i don't have a whole bunch of explaining to do say less i'm moving forward why because the enemy is on my tail and i don't have time but i've gotta live through who god says i am [Music] say less [Music] say less stop talking about it and walk it say less what you doing on sundays i see sundays you're not available anymore say less i got something to do cause my destiny is on the line i got something to do because my purpose is on the line you don't understand where i'm headed i'm headed somewhere where i'm bringing my family i'm headed somewhere where i'm breaking strongholds i'm headed somewhere because i know god is a deliverer [Music] say less [Music] when you see me say less i want to make an impact and god's saying growth track is here join the local church say less just show up god is saying i want you in freedom you say okay i'ma join groups when they come up here's what he's saying stop doing so much talking and trust in me that whatever it is that you declare you can expect it because it'll be in my purpose and my will say less this morning let's just walk in it say less be consistent i i tell people often it's gonna it's gonna be according to your actions not according to your words you don't have to tell me pastor i'm i promise i'mma be here no you'll just be here [Music] you must be committed to the vision that god has for your life and the deliverance that he's speaking over you today how about we say less and do more in jesus name let's celebrate god for his word today
