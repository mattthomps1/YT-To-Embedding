[Music] thank you let me run this through very quickly to you which is I believe in the Legacy of what God is doing I am a product of the legacy of my grandparents I'm a product of the legacy of my mother I'm a product of the Legacy of what God has instilled and already planned in my life for me to do and one thing I understand is that I believe that we're called to create something now that is so incredible that the community and people around us can continue to thrive I believe that God's giving us a vision that's so impactful that he wants us to be able to see the world change like never before I haven't even expressed everything that we've done this year from being able to be over in Togo Africa to make a difference as we're impacting lives and seeing lives not just change through spiritual things but God moving us through those spiritual things where a church in Togo was able to be able to take medical assistance into villages and to be able to impact lives in your giving gave us the ability to do so you don't know the amount of families that we have helped you don't understand the group of people that have been served food right at their door if I could go into the testimonies of what your giving has done you would understand that the things that you're doing here are not just about you but they're about how they extend further I want to let you know today is that we're called to impact the Next Generation somebody say the Next Generation we're called to make a difference we're called to impact we're called to change lives but the way in which we do that at its greatest points that we're called to know God at our church we believe we want you to know who God is our desires that you would know him for your self that you would have a relationship and experience the presence of the Living God and know that God can do and change anything in your life I want you within the presence of God and within the presence of church to understand that God can do Miracles beyond what you can imagine or think I want you to know that you're not just sitting in a seat to hear but you're sitting in a seat to hear to receive a seed that will be watered and through the watering of that seed it will produce somebody say a harvest I'm believing that there's a harvest in your life the Bible says if you can make the decision not to be weary in your well-doing in due season you would reap a harvest if you what faint not tell somebody beside you all you got to do is just hold on but in order to hold on you've got to have roots in order to have Roots you've got to know God not no church [Music] [Applause] we know Church the question is how much do we know God and our desire is that you would know God so God can set your life to be the most impactful life-changing world-changing life that you've ever experienced that when you've achieved every goal in life when you've fulfilled every moment in life when you have succeeded at everything that you could possibly think about or do that there is a resounding purpose that is still perpetuating in your life that there is nothing that any job or any place could ever fulfill but there's a purpose that still keeps sticking because you know God our desire is that you would have a kingdom relationship with him that just does not stop at coming to service but that when you wake up in the morning the Bible says you will go before him and ask him what is your will for my life asking him for daily bread that his will would be done on Earth that's already been declared in heaven we want you to know God First Peter chapter number three in verse 21 says this it says in baptism we show that we have been saved from death and doomed by the resurrection of Christ not because our bodies are washed clean by the water but because in being baptized we are turning to God and asking him to cleanse our hearts from sin here's what I want to declare over your life today that you would know God and that you would know God in such a way that he would speak directly to you so that he can show you and direct you every step of where your life is to go I want you to know in this moment that you're called to be able to celebrate a life that God has for you but you've got to tell your neighbor you've got to know God it's going to come more and to come and building relationship with the father it's going to come and releasing some things in your life it's going to come with you understanding that he has a purpose and a plan set aside for you I want you to know God and know him for yourself I want you to be able to detect his presence and to know that he's in the space I want you to be able to look beside you and recognize that God has given you the gift of healing or God has given you the gift of interpretation of tongues or God has given you yeah yeah yeah giftings because your salvation is not left until you getting into heaven your salvation is for the impact in the direct change of this world I want to let you know your world changer are you willing to tell somebody around you you're just you're more than an occupation you're a world changer [Music] or do you believe you're an occupation because if you believe feel the requirement of the greatest vision of wherever it is that you work or stay [Music] the vision will go no greater than that your ability will go no further than that and the satisfying will always be up to the promotion of others for you to see the greatest potential that you have but here's today I want to let you know you could be searching for a job and yet still find yourself in the wealthiest place possible because you have identified the purpose somebody say purpose that God has established over your life because you put knowing him first over your idea of understanding him the Bible says his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts so you cannot understand and understanding Clarity the mind of God without knowing the spirit of God so that you must have the spirit of God so you must be saved can I give y'all the old way they used to say it and then I'll interpret it for you they said you have to be saved Sanctified and filled not just with the Holy but they would say the precious [Applause] and filled with the precious gift of the Holy Spirit I want to tell you that your change doesn't stop at your salvation your change doesn't stop at baptism and your change doesn't stop at the unfilling of the Holy Spirit your change doesn't stop it keeps going because there is a constant maturing and developing of who God has called for you to be that's why with the greatest degree you can be confident and that's why with a high school education you can be confident because when purpose is over your life there is nothing that no demon in hell can do to stop you from moving to where God has called you to be don't you dare regret what you don't have you thank God for where you are now and say everything that I will fulfill in my life has nothing to even do with me I've just gotta be available enough and know God that God will use me and Propel my life like you you will be [Applause] anybody confused about their own life you don't even know how you got where you are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you got some folk that's so jealous of you because they don't understand because you don't understand me [Applause] foreign [Music] you decided to put him first but the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then it says in all these other things will be added unto you they don't understand how you suffer with ADHD but got six degrees [Applause] like how did you get through school I don't know ask God yeah how did you stay focused enough to remember I don't know I just remember submitting my will to the father and him propelling me because God loves to take us to the highest level of Education he loves to put us on the top of our occupation he loves to be a blessing to us I want you to get this thing right it doesn't matter what level you are wherever you are God got you there and he will keep you there as you keep yourself humble before him God take me to the next level use me to do the next thing I'll open up two three locations if you ask me to I am available to you but it comes through somebody say knowing god the second thing we want you to do is find Freedom because here's the thing if you cannot find Freedom then you have no ability to move any further than where you are some of us it's not your prayer life that has you stuck it is your lack of freedom foreign [Music] speaking this moment some of you have been asking God to free you from some things and God is speaking in this place to say I want to free you but you got to be available to be freed om I want to give you some Direction I want to give you something but you've got to be available for me to free you I'm going to tell you very quickly what's happening is that I'm noticing is that the world is trying to get us to compromise our mental spiritual and physical health and to substitute it for chemicals that will keep us at a standard of being okay [Music] Pastor do you understand mental health is real I 100 understand how mental health is real but here's what I believe that God's a deliverer and I believe that God can deliver us from those places of Brokenness if we're willing to receive the help to lock in it some of your anxiety is from the place of not being able to let go of what's taking place in your past some of us are dealing with the idea of Brokenness that has happened in our life that we don't have the ability to be able to get healing from I want to tell some of you is that you're waiting to be loved but God is waiting to love you and he's saying if you would open your arms and your heart to me I could heal you and bring you to the place where I work all things out for your good but you have to become free here's a level of your freedom as that scripture lets us know that God will forgive us of your sins the healing comes through accountability when you confess your faults one to another there is healing that takes place Pastor I don't like you to be in my business I really don't want to be in your business but the problem is is getting your business and you got to get in my business so that we can get some healing because I want to tell you something real quick your problem isn't new you're the only thing that's new so whatever you're going through whatever space you're in whatever moment that you're dealing with [Music] shouting and speaking in tongues won't eliminate your Brokenness your Brokenness will come through walking through the healing that God has called for you to release and to forgive and to let go so I want to speak this over your life today God wants you to be free not weighted down not burdened by your past not living out of your own mistakes but he wants you to be somebody say free this is the level that keeps us from moving into purpose because our bondage can lock us up to not be able to hear to flow to put our pride to decide and allow humility to take a step in our lives because here's what we think all of us think we know what's best for us and God says today I want to offer you somebody say healing I believe that healing is needed and healing is available but you've got to make that change I'm not going to sing the rest of the lyrics but there's a change that has to be made you will never break being a broken father you will never break being a broken husband you will never break being a broken son a broken Uncle a Broken Man until you are free your level of Education cannot free you your money cannot free you [Applause] [Music] cannot free you you must be freed in your heart [Music] here's why I know this is because [Music] there are many that are wondering will I ever breathe again and I want to speak to just real quick submit in here and I want to tell you that God wants to bring freedom so that you can live the life you were always called to live to lead the way you were called to lead and not to resent the place that you are now and I believe that freedom is on the inside if you allow it to be but you have to want freedom and freedom comes with a price and a sacrifice it means I've got to walk through it means I've got to be vulnerable it means I've got to admit to my mistakes it means that I have to ask for something to happen in me not just something to happen for me and I believe today that God wants to free [Music] and to do something in your life that you've never experienced before I believe there are women in here who your past has broken you so much that you're trying to prove it through your future and you're so focused on making everyone else believe that you yourself don't even believe right now but I'm praying to painted in such a way that whatever has happened whatever has taken place whatever has put the wall and barrier in your heart that your heart would be freed and open today and I just pray through a moment that so many of us that have been carrying this Garment of heaviness I prayed today that you could trade it for a spirit of praise and I pray today you could be freed in the name of Jesus something in store for your life and here's the last part pray through your freedom that point number three you would discover purpose [Music] my question today is do you understand the purpose life that God has given you not your occupation not your status not who you believe you are through what you make and through what you wear my question today is do you understand the purpose that God has said over your life right now if I if I said we talk saying what God is speaking over you would you be able to discover the giftings that are inside of you some of you are working for people you were never called to work for anybody you were called to lead it you were called to build it but the enemy is speaking in your ear like he spoke to Eve and he said are you sure that's what God Said and I'm telling you today that there's a vision on the inside of you that God wants to propel and move forward but you're called to discover your purpose I just need you to tell your neighbor real quick you have purpose [Music] we're gonna say this today we we almost threw but I need you to get this into your neighbor [Music] like I I need you to sow this seed I need you to get them to understand I need you to get this you have purpose position you have purpose Beyond how many figures you make you have purpose Beyond where you live and what you drive I want to let you know you have a purpose there's a burning inside of you that cannot be extinguished it cannot be burnt out you feel it you live with it you lay with it there's something more and I want you to know today you're not crazy there is something more [Applause] but if you don't believe there's something more you'll never allow God to do the work to establish what it is so I want you to help me to help your neighbor to understand that what's inside of you is so crazy [Music] that you can even imagine what it's going to do in this world foreign I just I need you to get this talk to people who make millions and are empty [Music] empty empty and I'm telling you today whatever placement of money or whatever it is it is not enough to fulfill you got to get free and then you've got to start discovering the purpose so I need you [Music] to be weird right now we gonna be weird because some of us are going to talk to some people and we never talked to before but we're going to believe so much of what God can do in their life that the Bible says we're two or three are gathered together and say I gotta know you like that it just said where two or three are gathered together touching and agreeing there will be in the midst and I'm just believing if you could just plant a seed remember we talked about the Meat level degree level and the sea level you may be struggling right now between the Green level like pasta I don't feel like it right now I'm like I know but you came to church and it's hot you might as well go all the way I want you to sow a seed today I want you to look for a person don't ignore this moment I want you to find a person if they sleep wake them up first because we want to make sure they're alive two we make sure they didn't pass out three we want to sow a c but I want you to find somebody and I just want you to look at them weird look at them [Music] look [Music] yeah it's weird ain't it it's real weird right now I want to go to this church you should already know by the name we was weird all right and I want you to look at them and I want you to tell them intentionally don't you miss this moment you you have purpose say it slow down you said it too fast [Music] you have purpose purpose you're not just here you have purpose I want you to find somebody else real quick you got your practice out the way you didn't believe me anyway you ain't believe me anyway so I'm not even sawing almost he's over there I need to find somebody else I want you to find your second choice and I need you to stir them in their face and I need you to say this to them I need you to say it right to them slow y'all don't say it all fast mean it say you do this all right let's go around I need you to find the third choice and don't Smack when you look at them oh ah jeez I was trying to avoid you I didn't know he was going there I need you to look him in the face I need this the last go-round I need you to stare at them look them I'm about to get real uncomfortable and I just need you to look at them in the face and tell them you have purpose [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just want you to if you can just throw your hand up in the air just say God thank you thank you for purpose it's not determined by my past it's not even determined by my moment right now you already established it the Bible says in Psalm 139 it says this for you for you created my in most pain you knit me together in my mother's womb it says I praise you [Music] because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made I am fearfully and wonderfully me it says your works are wonderful [Music] I know that fall too well that's a confident moment don't listen you can be confident and be humble the problem is is we do this false humility and oh you know not me no no that's it's not me no I'm telling y'all straight up I wrote this David got it from me your works and I am the work of God are wonderful I am wonderful I don't care what you think I am wonderful and it says I know that full well why do you walk so confidently because I'm wonderful did you see the way he made me yeah it says all the days ordained for me were written in your book for one of them came to be you're not a mistake you're not an accident you're not a surprise you didn't just get here it wasn't just to random people it was God orchestrating the universe so that you would come into fruition so that you could be a part of the plan that God set for this world to change the world forever you have a purpose and because you have a purpose Point number four is that God is called for you to make a difference I want to let you know today that there is something inside of you that you offer that no one else in the world can offer he's called for you to make a difference to make an impact and make a change [Music] and today I want you to know he picked the right person thank you [Music] some of you are in a journey right now the most uncomfortable part of your life because you're in Uncharted territories that you've never been in before and it's requiring you to activate your faith because the Bible lets us know that faith without works instead and we don't live off of dead faith and so we are required to allow our faith activated to move into a new place what God is about to do in your life as I speak this over you and what God is about to do in you [Music] is not for the benefit of you but it's for the benefit of the world and the enemy is going to try as John 10 and 10 says the thief is going to do everything to kill to steal and to destroy but Jesus said if you trust him enough if you could just recognize that he is the way the truth and the life I want to tell you this [Music] he said the thief may come to steal kill and destroy Jesus said but I come that you might have life and have it to the full more abundantly you're called to make a difference [Music] you're not just call to be here and to exist your call to make a difference John chapter 15 verse 8 and 11 says Jesus said this is to my father's Glory that you bear much fruit [Music] showing yourselves to be my to my disciples he says I've told you this so that my joy somebody say Joy may be in you and that your joy Maybe complete the joy that you're waiting for in your life comes through you fulfilling the purpose that God has said over your life there is no amount of donations there is no amount of giving serving that can ever replace fulfilling the call that God has over your life you're called to make a difference you're called to change lives start that non-profit that you thought you didn't know what it would do it he didn't know where it would go but you did it anyway and you created it and you started doing things that you've never done before you started achieving goals you never achieved before how about you start that how about you start the business how about you start moving in a way that you've never seen before and I'm promising you today everything that God has spoken over your life shall come to pass if you're available for him to do it let's make a difference in the world not salvation [Applause]
