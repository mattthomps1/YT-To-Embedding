[Music] [Music] good morning guys i am mishi and this is mix kids but first let me tell you who we are we are a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world we want to give you guys fun and exciting ways to know god so that you can tell others about god's love i am so happy to be here with you this week last week we talked about how jonah got swallowed up by a big fish because he was not obedient to god today is mother's day don't forget to say happy mother's day to those special ladies in your life you have to say thanks for being so incredible mom [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] brace yourselves what a great day to talk about a mother's obedience to god one of the things that i love about god's word and the bible is that god gives us stories to read about real people who made really good choices as well as some people who didn't make so good choices god wants us to listen read and learn from these stories to become more like him when we listen to directions and follow god's teaching that's called obedience today in our scripture reading we are going to discuss a mother who gave up everything she had to follow the directions of a godly man because she did this and trusted god she was able to take care of her sons and have more than eat enough enough vegetables enough oil enough bread enough everything during biblical times people needed olive oil to make almost everything they ate they used it in their lamps for life therefore it was always important to have enough oil available for daily needs in addition most of the women did not have regular paying jobs to help with their family's income when a poor married woman became a widow a widow is someone whose husband has passed away it is very difficult for her to support her family take a look at her story the message for today's story is god's people care for one another has your family ever asked to borrow something from a neighbor maybe some flour or sugar or perhaps a garden tool a poor widow once borrowed some unusual things from her neighbors the poor widow came to elisha with tear stains on her face my husband was a good man who loved the lord but now he is dead she said the man my husband owed money to says if i don't pay him he will take away my two sons to be his slaves how can i help you elisha ask gently tell me what do you have in your house nothing the widow answered i have nothing except for a little oil elisha thought about her need go to all your friends and neighbors he said and borrow as many jars as you can then go home and shut the door pour the oil from your jar into all the empty borrowed jars so the widow and her sons filled their house with their neighbor's empty jars then the woman shut the door and she began to pour oil from her jar into the first borrowed jar the oil kept flowing and soon that first jar was full and she poured into the next jar and she poured into the jar after that and she kept going and going and soon she lost count she just kept pouring until all the jars were full bring me another jar she said there aren't any more jars mother her boys exclaimed you filled them all the woman's eyes sparkled she hurried out of the house and ran to find elisha i did exactly what you said i brought as many empty jars as i could and now they're all filled with oil and i still have oil in my jar elisha smiled go and sell the oil he said pay back what your husband owed and you will have money left over for you and your sons to live on the widow woman praised the lord for the miracle of the oil she thanked god for taking care of her and she thanked him for elisha and her neighbors that day the widow and her sons learned that they could trust the lord to take care of them we can trust god to send the right people to take care of us too boys and girls god wants us to be good neighbors as well how can you be a good neighbor and how can you help others today the widow's sons were probably very scared that their mother did not have the money or supplies she needed to take care of their family so when elijah elisha tells the mother to send the boys out to collect jars and dump out the only thing left in their house the important oil used for many things it is very hard to understand why the widow would obey elijah the oil was the only valuable thing that they had left the widow was probably desperate to have the little oil that she had the widow's son trusted their mother and followed her directions the widow obeyed god's instructions as a result of her obedience he performed a miracle to provide the widow with all she needed and more as kids sometimes it's hard to follow your parents instructions because we do not understand their purpose or we think we know better god's word tells us we should honor the teachings of our parents and remember the things our parents do and teach us above all we should follow their instructions when we do our wisdom will grow and grow god sees obedience toward our parents is honoring him just as our bible verse states for today help me say it together honor your father and your mother so that you may live long in the land your lord your god is giving you exodus 20 and 12. thanks so much for helping with the memory verse before we go let's sing and dance to one way by hillsong kids [Music] [Applause] [Music] i live [Music] in trouble times [Music]
