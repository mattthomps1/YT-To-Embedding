[Music] good morning guys i am mishi and this is mix kids first let me tell you who we are we are a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world we want to give you guys fun and exciting ways to know god so that you can tell others about god's love i am so happy to be here with you this week last week we talked about gideon and how nothing is impossible with god have you ever heard a voice but wasn't sure who it was this happens a lot on the telephone someone calls and you may say who is this and then they tell you you say oh yeah and then the voice makes sense what if you hear a strange voice calling you would you go to the person speaking our story today is about a young boy named samuel he was about 12 years old when he heard a voice in the middle of the night he thought it was his master calling so he went to see what his master wanted but it wasn't his master calling him let's take a look to see who called samuel stories of the bible god speaks to samuel this is samuel hi samuel was the son of hannah hannah prayed for god to give her a son and god did so hannah gave samuel back to god and samuel grew up in the temple serving under eli the priest eli as samuel grew up he learned how to serve god from eli [Music] samuel lived in the house of god but he did not know god or what god's voice sounded like in those days messages from god were rare but one night after eli had gone to bed samuel was sleeping in the tabernacle when suddenly god called out samuel huh samuel got up and ran to eli and said did you call me mommy eli said i didn't call you go back to bed so samuel did then god called out again samuel and again samuel got up and ran to eli asking did you call me mommy eli said i didn't call you go back to bed so samuel did god called samuel for a third time samuel and samuel went to eli yet again after three times eli realized that god was trying to speak to samuel so eli taught samuel to say speak lord your servant is listening okay samuel went back to bed and god came and called as before samuel samuel and samuel said speak your servant is listening god told him many things about what would happen to israel as samuel grew up god was with him and everything god spoke through samuel came true samuel was seen as a great prophet of god because he could hear the voice of god and he listened when god spoke to him here we have a cell phone for talking and listening a timer so that we can hear when time is up and a radio so we can listen to music what does these things have in common that's right we hear them we use our ears to hear the cell phone timer and radio but we hear god by listening with our hearts we may hear god through the words of the bible through our pastor like pastor marcus or even our parents and maybe even our mixed kids teacher like me most often we will hear him when we pray if we listen carefully with our heart god will speak to us god is calling us if we will listen he truly wants to communicate with us guide us and share his will with us there are many distractions in this world that may keep us from hearing the voice of god but the biggest distraction of all is simply not taking the time to listen instead we fill up our time with television or video games when we could be reading the bible or even praying this week take a few extra minutes to pray and ask god to help you hear him then listen for the still small quiet voice of god god wants nothing more than to be in a relationship with you and me our memory verse for this week says blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it luke 11 and 28 thanks so much for helping me with this week's memory verse before we go let's sing and dance to one way by hillsong kids [Applause] [Music] i lay my life down at your feet [Music] i put your [Music] jesus [Music] you're the only one you're the only one you're [Music] you were always always there [Music] jesus you're the only jesus you're the only one that i [Music] [Music] but what we're gonna do now is get down nice and low that's it how low can you go and where are you going to sing you are the way the truth is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] for you [Music] [Music] for you [Music] one way [Music] [Applause] welcome back did you get pictures or videos of your worship to god we would love to see please have your parents send those pictures and videos to our instagram page at the mix underscore church becoming a part of god's family is a great decision to make so if you need help understanding how to become a part of god's family have your parents send us an email at mixed kids at themixchurch.com now let's pray together dear god thank you for loving me help me to know your voice when you speak to me talking to you daily helps me to hear your voice in jesus name amen well this is the last week of our series check us out next week for a brand new series i can't wait to see you guys have an amazing week and we'll see you in
