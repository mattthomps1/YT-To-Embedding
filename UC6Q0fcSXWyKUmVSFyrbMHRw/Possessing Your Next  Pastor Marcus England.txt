[Music] thank you we welcome you to the mix my name is Marcus England and I'm the lead Pastor here and I am so grateful that you're with us today I want to start uh the the title this context of our message today which I figure is a part three since I've been using the Satan word I'm I want you to come from this context possessing your necks possessing your next anybody here to possess what God has for them anybody believing that God has something in store greater than what you could ever do greater than what you could ever imagine by yourself I'm here to believe that God has something in store for your life that is greater than what you could ever imagine or think and today I want to lead you in the pathway of possessing your necks we are in Joshua chapter one and we're going to start at verse one and then we're going to jump over to Joshua chapter six this is scripture after the context of Israel being free yet still in bondage they've been free out of Egypt as slaves but they are still walking in the bondage of the Brokenness within themselves and oftentimes I want to let you know you're all almost there you're just not all the way there there is an idea to the fact that God has set you free but there is a freedom that must come inside of you in your mind that must move beyond the salvation of what Jesus has done to a place through the Holy Spirit where the manifestation of what God wants to do permeates in and through your life there are three things that I believe that Jesus wants to do something through you that Jesus wants to do something for you and that Jesus wants to do something in you and in doing so I believe that there is something to understand that while he has brought me out of Darkness I have to be responsible for walking with him through what we call The Marvelous Light to see what John 10 and 10 says that he came that we might have life and life more abundantly it is found that Moses has passed away and God is setting up this new generation for a season of somebody say possession I believe God is calling for us to possess and I believe God has something in store for you today and so we're going to jump in Joshua chapter 1 starting at verse 1 through verse 3 and Joshua is now the new leader over God's people and he says this after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord the Lord said to Joshua the son of nun Moses assistant now here's where God gets a little harsh and you got to understand there's a great side there's a true sight there's a loving side those are all a part of God but also God has a real side and sometimes we don't like the real side of God because it seems like he's not emotional or connected as the Bible says that we have a high priest who cannot uh who can really understand the touchings the feelings of our infirmities we have a high priest who understands everything we go through but in this moment Jesus under God understands well here's what he's saying even though I understand I need from you to move on from where you've been hurt to where I'm calling you to be and he said this to Joshua and he said he says in verse 2 Moses my servant is dead while God thanks I remember it says Thou therefore arise go over this Jordan you and all this people into the land I am giving to them last week we're in Genesis chapter 12. and what did he tell Abram he said Abram I will show when we get into Joshua he says I will give there's a difference between the promise and The Possession in the stage of the promise God is showing you everything he has in store for you but here's what I want to let you know in order for you to get where God calls you to be you have to possess what he's showing you so he says to Joshua I am giving them this lamb to the people of Israel he says every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon I have given to you he says just as I promised Moses if we jump to verse 7 he says this only be strong tell somebody beside you you got to be strong he said in very courageous tell him and you got to be courageous being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left that you may have good success wherever you go the Lord let's promise Israel you shall walk into your possession but I wanted to give you a picture that sometimes the things that God has promised you do not always come into fruition the way that you want them to here's what I want to tell you whatever God has planned for your life is not even about you it's about the impact that you will make in the world it's about the change that you will make in a generation it's about the curse that you will break that will break forth a generation to live out the purpose and plan that God has for you whatever it is that God is blessing you with now is never for you it is to be a blessing so when we jump to Joshua chapter 6 it says now Jericho this was one of the areas of the land where Joshua and the people of Israel are promised land to God and he says now Jericho was shut up I I know somebody today God has promised you something and you have no resource and no door to walk through to get it but I'm here today to let you know just because it's shut up don't mean it won't come down it says now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the people of Israel he says None went out and none came in it says in the Lord said to Joshua see I have given Jericho into your hand see I have given that business that position see I have opened the door for you see that even though they have not called you back yet I just want to let you know it's already yours he says see I've given Jericho unto your hand and with its king and Mighty Men of Valor he says this it's getting kind of weird Lord what's the tactic how do you want me to take over you want me to barge it down you what you want me to do you want me you want me to rush in and God says no no I don't need you to do anything I just need you to wait and be obedient he says here's an instruction you shall March around the city God that's crazy I'm here to let you know that first thing that God called you to do is always the hardest thing because it's the most craziest thing that it looks like you should never do because if people see you do it you will look like you have lost your mind I'm here today to let you know there is some crazy faith that you've got to use today in order to get to the next season of possession that God has for you tell your neighbor real quick you're gonna look a little crazy I don't know if you felt that but I felt that you're going you're going to look a little crazy somebody is gonna look at your storyline and say they ain't got nothing going on but they don't understand why you are in the background working the reason you ain't posted is because God is working uh something in the midst and just because you can't see it does it mean she ain't working look he says you shall March around the city all the men of War going around the city once thus shall you do for six days God you you want me to look like a fool all year you you want me to keep applying for that job that they you want me to go back to that same loan officer and ask for that same amount again I will look crazy they're gonna see me coming and they are going to reject me he says I want you to do it as long as I've told you to do it he said do it for six days he says seven priests shall bear trumpets of Ram's Horn before the ark and on the seventh day you shall March around the city seven times and the priest shall blow the trumpets and when they make a long blast with the Rams throwing you when you hear the sound of the trumpet then all of the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall not you not you shall climb not you shall move in not you shall hit it at a different level all he says is that you're gonna have a praise that's going to open up the door that was shut understood why I was praising God like the way I was today is because there are some things shut up that I need God to open up and that nothing that I can do but there's something that my praise can do that I'm aren't you crazy enough to believe that if I could Praise Him and Shout out God might open up a door the Bible says he'll open up a Windows of heaven and pour out a blessing you don't have room to receive anybody got a shout believe that God can open up a door right now [Music] all right all the crazy people sit down sit down your neighbor gonna think you lost it sit down yelling in the AFC I knew I shouldn't have sat in this section I swear to Usher put me I knew I shouldn't have sat in this section [Music] [Applause] it's just in all the people shall Shout with great Shout it says in the wall of the city will fall down [Laughter] when something Falls you you think it falls in a way that you still have to to climb over it see a wall coming down you immediately believe that the rubble is going to stack which means it's going to require you to go over but he told them that everywhere the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours if I've got to climb over it then the Soul of my foot might miss a place and in order to declare and claim that everything God has for me it means I've got to walk flat-footed over it to be able to possess it God that's what you said it if I if if everywhere the soul of my foot shall tread upon I shall happen it means that my foot has to be flat in order to claim it so I need you to break down the wall that I don't have to climb over anything past the time but everything that the Lord has for me I'll just keep walking don't ain't worry about it keep on walking I ain't talking I'm just letting you know I'm gonna walk right over everything that God has for me because there is no wall that he won't break down it says in everything will come flat and the people shall go up everyone was somebody say straight straight before tell somebody I don't have time to bet notice the scripture said straight because he said don't bear what to the left and don't bear what to the right but that means then you got to do what keep straight so in order to keep straight that means that you've got to flatten everything in my way so I don't have to go around I want to let you know I'm called to walk right through all of my problems and situation I'm called to walk right through all of the mess that the devil had in front of me I'm called to walk right through everything that's supposed to be in my pathway move us away God has already declared it it is mine yes and amen the Lord in this place [Music] I'm walking straight I'm not moving to the left and I'm not moving to the right but I'm walking straight because he told me if I walk straight I possess everything that the soul of my foot shall tread upon I believe it to be so somebody just tell your neighbor real quick walk straight [Music] all right sit down imma pray Lord Jesus bless us amen all right oh thank you musicians you've been up here for a long time I appreciate y'all hey man let's give it up for our team y'all our Dream Team listen the Bible says we're called to walk straight and narrow it's a path that we go because the Bible lets us know there's there's a white gate and in this wide gate everybody goes through this direction but it says narrow somebody say narrow narrow is the road that leads to the things that God has called for you to possess and to place your hand upon it is not the wide Road it is not the road that is traveled by everyone the things that everyone says the ideas that everyone has what what you're finding in the narrow road is a Christian that stops at the point where they want the blood but they don't want God's lordship and we want what God can offer us Save Me Jesus just don't lead me but the Bible says there's a there's a narrow road there's a pathway there there's a straight way that God has called for you to go and in the straight way there is possession on the other side of whatever it is that God is breaking down on your behalf today I believe that if you understand your possessing season you will not find yourself at the place where you're ready to give up because it's usually at the season right of your somebody say a breakthrough a breakthrough is where what God is getting ready to move but the enemy is doing everything to keep you from receiving what God has over your life I believe [Music] greatest adversity in your life that you have to live through deal with and figure out so do not be alarmed when life feels as if it is erupting in your life and you have no control I think that you are at the border of somebody say a breakthrough through there's a possession for you he Ard in times we don't understand is that we want to move in directions that seem easy to claim but the problem is is that anything that God has called you to will never be easy it will always be hard to get over the fear and to get over the anxiety and to get over the depression and to get over the things that seem to be unobtainable but I'm here today to let you know that whatever God has for you it is what for you and Joshua understood it says God starts off of Joshua and says to him hey Moses my servant is dead that's a little harsh I could be harsh therapy what if you walked into a therapist's office and said listen I want to talk about my pet that died and say why do you want to talk your pet is dead get over it you say first of all I don't think you have your license because that's not how this works there's a walking through and there's a time a morning and there's a time where you have to get healing and there's a time where you have to grow and there's a time where you have to understand and so here's the thing there was a selected amount of time for Joshua and Israel to mourn but once the given time was over the Bible says he spoke to Joshua and said it's time to get up here's what I want to tell someone today in your healing it does not mean you are not to be mobilized God may be healing you at a part of your life but it does not mean you're supposed to stop moving where he's called for you to move what I get with church people is that we get the opportunity to be able to sit back from God say God you know what I don't want to do this today if we can pick this up tomorrow I would love it I would pick it up better I just today is not anybody ever been there before you just want to tell God today is not my day a morning there's some things I'm going through I'm just not feeling it I'm I'm not up for it I don't want it I don't want to do it I'm not interested I'm not in the emotional space and God says I don't care about your emotional space God I'm tired I'm kidding I'm about you're tired I feel like it today I don't care nothing about you feeling like it because I've created you with purpose and my purpose does not stop according to what you feel or where you are in your life I am God which means I have the strength to help you overcome any place that you are that's why he said in your weakest points my strength is made perfect ah God doesn't seem really caring he doesn't seem like the warm high priest that was supposed to be all fuzzy with because what God is trying to do is he's trying to move you past a place where you have dedicated your life to your feelings and if you dedicate your life to always how you feel then you dedicate your life to being in an emotional imbalance founding your place at one minute you're sad one minute you're crying one minute you're up one minute you're laughing and it looks like you have a joker syndrome that's going on in your life because you're all over the place and God says if I built you according to the way you feel then you would be so all over the place you would never be able to get what I've called you to receive I'm calling you to live out of your purpose not out of your emotions your emotions get you in trouble anybody know that can you be real with it your emotions will have you go into the darkest deepest place in the most isolated moments of your life your emotions will have you stay away and say everybody's looking at me I know they talking about me I ain't saying nothing to them until I can get it together and God is saying here's what I do I work in your Brokenness not after your Brokenness God is the god that says I see where you are now and I want to use you and you say nope I got to get myself together God I gotta I have to get myself together so that I can be in a place to be able to be used and God says you're never at a perfect place to be used by me you're always broken messed up striving to do better so let the perfectionism go and say God use me whether it's an up day a down day God use me whether I'm in my best emotional state or not God used me whether I'm broke or got a lot of money God use me whether I'm good or I'm not good God use me it doesn't matter the state of where you are God says I'll use you just like you are and if you give me a chance I'll change your life forevermore he said but I need you to possess the land I need you to go after what I've called you I've shown you I've already declared it to be yours you have to walk in it here is the thing God's promised it but you must possess it if you don't possess what God has for you you're waiting for God to do something that is already manifested the context is is you believe that God is working out your life as you go but the Bible already lets us know that every one of your days is already written so he's not working it out as you get in motion it's already worked out just take your neighbor real quick it's already worked out if you lived like it was already worked out the mindset that you would gather is that as I'm operating God is fixing and making a pathway so that I can say on the straight and narrow and not get off to the left or to the right so that I would understand he's using me to make an impact here's the thing we would have moments of what we call failure and God said nope it's just a part of the plan [Applause] it's just a part of what I'm creating and building yes you got rejected because if you go down that road it's gonna mess you up and it's gonna draw you away from me so I have to what shut up the doors from the inside and the out you can't pay your way you can't graduate your way you can't pay nobody you ain't got no resume that can get you in only thing that can do it is nothing but the favor of God so you just got to wait for instruction and say God move in my midst when you're possessing your season you have to understand your requirements of what God wants to do and what he wants to speak through your life but if you are so consumed in your loss that you will never arise and get up to possess he says Joshua get up he says arise what's the hardest thing for us to do sometimes in the morning some of us truth whoa how many of you got like 10 snooze buttons like 10 10 alarms six fifteen 6 30. it's getting real close now you like 6 31. 635 eventually if you're married somebody like get up get up now that alarm don't went off seven times because the hardest thing to do when you're comfortable is a rise the hardest thing to do when you're stuck is to get up it's the biggest challenge because the body loves comfort the body loves to be in position where it's in control it has everything put together it's on its own right path and it's feeling good and I'm not even talking about from a standpoint of things being bad but here is the thing if you don't know God's Direction in your life you will always settle for the area of comfort and comfort will put you in a place where you always are laying and laying means you can't see forward you can only see up and God wants to move you forward in a straight path when you're looking up you can't move so he says I want to give you a pathway I want to give you a straight way and he said so I need you Moses to arise I want to tell somebody today no matter where you are I need you to get up from your comfortable state because God wants to move you he wants to change you he wants to put you in the next step so wherever your foot Treads you can claim if you got that right there you would understand that while you're laying down your foot cannot claim anything for wherever the soul of your foot shall tread upon that in which you shall have and you shall claim when you're laid up you can't claim a thing you can't get to the place that he's opening you can't get to the job that he's opening you can't walk to the bank to withdraw somebody needed a shout right there you can't get to the things God has for you when you're laying so your foot cannot claim your possession thank you so that's why the enemy keeps you laid up because of where the soul of your foot shall move shall be the place you claim if you actually started walking you would start walking into the purpose that God has for your life the enemy says settle that job pay you good enough that's all you got to do is work get back up and do you and God said I call for you to claim an entire area and you're claiming the position [Applause] I called you to be president and you're just trying to be director but he says stay comfortable that's for the enemy stay comfortable keep Mourning keep mourning about yesterday that you can do nothing about instead of moving into tomorrow and understanding what you do now impacts your next see where I am now has everything to do with what I did what I do now will have everything to do with where I'm going so I've got to change my now to impact my next my question today is do you have a plan now for what's about to happen tomorrow tell your neighbor real quick you need a plan you got oh my god oh man you got I don't like plans pastor I just believe the Lord just speaks well if I would take you back to the Old Testament it seems that God had a plan with everything that he did every direction that he went every place that he went he had a plan when it got to the Tabernacle he had a plan and can I tell you the plan was not a spaced out plan it was an exact plan if you go back to the building of the Tabernacle you'll see that everything was exact with color with with length with width with height he gave you exactly everything that you needed God is not a god of mystical details he's the god of exact clarity they do that I believe is that there are three things that we need to have in order for us to possess our next the first thing that you need is that you need faith for the journey you need faith for the journey why because I need to be able to believe somebody say believe must believe that I have everything I need for the next season of where I am going one of the greatest things that the enemy likes to attack us with is two things one is your pride it's the person that says I got this don't worry I got this I don't need y'all I'm good I listen I am good I put it all together I am well versed I have my education I have my knowledge I have my training I'm one of the best ones out there and the Bible says you need to humble yourself before the mighty hand of God but we always can talk about Pride here's what we don't talk about where the enemy leads us in inadequacy because the same enemy that gives you pride is the same enemy that makes you feel like you don't have what it takes to possess what God has for you and it is the idea to get over the place that you are inadequate where you are for what God has called you to now here's what I want to let you know you don't have everything you need for the possession of what God's calling you to but you are not inadequate because you are everything that God has called you to be to be able to possess what he's calling you to possess I am not inadequate I am everything I need to be just tell your neighbor real quick you got it together don't you worry you oh you got it I got everything I need for the next season now Five Seasons down I don't I don't know what God showed me no I'm a little job I'm still a little jacked up on that one but listen for the next season I got what it takes because God Don't Make an adequate creations songs lets us know is that he created and formed us in our mother's womb he he created us at such an impactful state that where we are he said he looked at us and said it is good sometimes you need to get up in the morning and just tell the Lord and yourself in that mirror you're right it is good God sometimes you you ever you just need to get there Mike just stay in one place and get in the mirror and look at God and say Lord you did a work today I mean I thought I was impressed but when I looked again oh it is good see that's the problem humility does not mean I lack confidence ah if somebody could understand the enemy is often trying to teach you the difference that pride and having confidence are the same thing I'm here today to let you know is that you need to be confident and humble God I understand it is good but it is good because you said so but what I need you to stop doing is putting yourself down because you don't know who you are in order for other people to bring you up because you lacking yourself the confidence to speak to yourself David said he was hearing himself on the inside and itself was trying to talk him out of what God had him to do David said so what what wrong with you yourself together put your hope in God for our what yet Praise Him somebody needs to talk to themselves today and get up and say God said in Genesis it is good so I'm getting up today it don't matter how I look and where I am I am good enough for where I am today and God will take me to the next level of where I need to be don't you wait for somebody to give you a compliment for you to know who you are you walk out that house and say I already know who I am I've already been declared through the word of God that I am more than a conqueror I understand that I am the head and not the tail I'm above and not beneath I'm blessed in my going out and my coming in you don't know who I am it is good that's walking all around you but God keep me as I stay humble before you [Applause] tell your neighbor you need some confidence you need to know who God says you are you need to be able to speak to yourself and declare over it that's right I look good today it doesn't matter what you think this thing ain't wrapped up in your opinion if I understood that I would be created by the god of the Universe I wouldn't care how many likes I got I just be sitting on there I know this is good I don't care how many people view this this is good but I need faith for the journey because if I don't believe that God is willing to use me than what I miss out on is that God could use me even in the midst of my imperfections can can somebody in here admit that while you're not where you used to be you're not where you want to be could anybody be there and just like where I'm at but I can tell you what God has brought me to is a great place you got to have faith for the journey the scripture lets us know if you look in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 it says this let us keep looking to not ourselves but it says let us keep looking to Jesus he is the one who started this journey of faith and he is the one who completes the Journey of Faith it says as Jesus Paid no attention to The Shame of the cross he suffered there because of the joy he was looking forward to then he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God here's what I want to tell you is that in your Journey of Faith a journey implies changes transitions challenges Adventures and I'm sure that you desire Comfort right now but for the next phase of where you're going you're going to have to trust God which means you're going to have to be uncomfortable which means it's not going to feel like you wanted to feel Point number two that's we're learning and Gathering faith for the journey we got to have courage for the fight I remember when I got to high school and I'm going to share this this is great um story about myself I can put myself out there I decide that my wife says often I put her and the rest of my family out there so I'll put myself out there today I went to a school it was a school that my mom pulled me out of the the Catholic school that I went to in the city and I went out to a county school and it was far out it was out in Towson and you know when I got out there I was the only kid African-American kid in my grade and so I got there and I wasn't nervous about the space but I was nervous about the surrounding I had never been in this kind of surrounding before and I never forget growing and learning and I mean just having so many different friends and it was a life-changing moment for me and then I left that school and went to another school in elementary and again I was the only African-American kid in that grade and I'll never forget walking through and just really being able to relate here's when stuff changed my mom stopped working out in Towson and she came to work for the Lord which means we were back in the city so she said to me son as a middle school you're going to go to but it's not going to be like the ones you just came out of no problem should be good where are we going now I don't know if you know when I'm I would tell you I I went she said you're going to Hamilton Middle School now there were two Hamiltons can we be can we can we get fresh like can we be they're two Hamiltons there was a good one and there was a not so good one I consider because she loved me that she would send me to the good one I was mistaken there was no love I was abandoned memories of Brokenness still linger in my heart she said oh no no no you're not going to that one you're going to Hamilton Middle I said the one that fights Herring run she said correct [Applause] the fear that set in my heart my God I hadn't been in the city in the wild folks and I was ready to take on that Journey well I went to school and I put on a brave face and I'm telling you I had to do many things first of all I had to start catching the bus I want nothing but that high with a book bag about this low walking to the bus stop because I couldn't keep it up just say you're gonna get on that 22 Mile West of 22. it is down two blocks across Edison Highway it was called the highway y'all it was a highway it said Edison now it's not really a highway but it was like a highway y'all and she told me I had to catch the bus I get all on the bus and catch the 22. I know it it's in my mind trying to get healing I catch the 22 and she says you need to transfer anybody remember to transfer that little piece of paper that looked like a receipt right now and you had to have that Circle you know how you do forget you get on you got all this instruction but I got on the bus and lost everything got on just kept going sir you need to put something in the ticket okay my bad sorry about that let me put something in the ticket okay and do you want to transfer yes yes that's what she said I need a transfer let me get one of those the bus lets me off I have to walk across Harford Road anybody in the east side know about Harford Road it's like 19 Lanes yes yes I had to walk across I'm just trying to tell you the tragedies a common place all kinds of diseases okay no I'm not going there all right so I get across I catch the 19 I hand my transfer I get into a school the school is humongous it's massive it's children everywhere I don't know what to do I don't know how you on your own remember Elementary School people guide you they had signs it looks like sometimes when you come in church and people like welcome to the mix you know like that it would no there were no signs there were nothing and they said you have to come in and I had to find my class and I'll never forget I found my class I went to my homeroom and and and and and and as soon as you move into a new season of your life the enemy is always trying to try you now this wasn't my faith step this was my mother's face step I don't know why God tried me in her faith all right we get to the point I get in class I get into a I don't even know what kind of class it is the teacher starts teaching and leaves the class and a little boy starts picking with me oh Jesus my previous schools did not prepare me for this in my previous school we talked it out there was a PTA you came together you shared you talked about your heart that's how it felt they didn't do that here they left you alone Anarchy begins to erupt little boy saw us coming at me now I need courage for the journey the problem is is oftentimes when we're moving into a new season we don't move out of carriage we move out of fear and fear is the pattern that we operate out of so we don't hear God's voice leading us so we make decisions out of our Brokenness because we are in need of God to do something in that we're not willing to wait for God to do so we operate on I operated on my own little boy kept bothering kept bothering me I got fearful and fearful and fearful he kept bothering me till I turned around and punched him dead in the face he went down now you think I would have been like do it again no tears begin to come down my eyes oh God I am so sorry I don't know what this is inside of me but God take it out of me the idea is this is often times because we've gotten results out of fear we don't move out of faith and we don't have the courage to trust God to do what's next in our life because we're operating off of intense fear intense fear they're going to take the whole intense fear they're going to take the car intense fear I'm not going to have as much as I want intense fear it's not going to give me The credibility of who I am intense fear if people know I fail what will they think about me and God says I have you on a straight path I've already declared that everywhere the foot of your soul shall tread you shall have so stop being scared in the journey that I've called you to because you're already Victorious because I've already taken care of everything scripture says in Philippians chapter 4 verse 13 it says this I can do all somebody say all all things which he has called me to do through him who strengthens and empowers me to fulfill his purpose I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency I am ready for anything tell your neighbor I'm ready for anything I'm equal to anything through him who enthuses me with inner strength and what confident peace I gotta have carriage for the journey he told Joshua be strong and very courageous for the Lord thy God is with you today I want to let you know the Lord thy God is with you so be strong be courageous not in yourself but what God has already declared over your life and point number three it's where all of us need to work we're going to need all obedience for possession sometimes I'm finding ourselves at a place to Believe In the Journey and sometimes will my fighting some of y'all like I'm ready I I swear I'm so ready I will fight and God's like not that there's a fighter in you here's here's where God has to break the stronghold in your submission God has to break the stronghold and will you be obedient to me will I be Lord over your life will you lord your own life because you get results but he says when you're obedient to me I'll give you there's a different possession there is a possession that God gives and there's a possession that you steal what God has for you he's already giving you some of us are finding ourselves at a place where we are so gregarious and where we are in life that the problem that we find is that we're stealing things that aren't ours you got the job but it wasn't supposed to be your job you raised but God told you to resign so he could take you somewhere else and you stayed there you got the car but God actually told you to sell the car and give it away but because obedience was something that limited your ability to feel comfortable you reject obedience and say God I'll have faith for the journey have courage for the fight but I'm going to do it my own way and I'm here today you cannot possess what God has for you doing it your own way it's called for us to be obedient to live according to his word the Bible lets us know today that he already has a plan that's established for your life I'm here today to let you know that God has everything already laid out you just have to be obedient in possession stop trying to do it on your own stop trying to do it your own way stop trying to make your efforts God's efforts God says today I want to let you know that I think about this more and more if you're on social media or you're on Networks you're seeing people are dying at younger ages people are losing control where the holy spirit gives self-control people are walking away from this life and here is the promise that God says if you follow me in obedient when we get before him he'll be able to say Well done thy good and faithful servant the problem is is that I'm more interested in what man is saying on Earth than I'm interested in what God is saying in heaven I pray today that in your possession you be obedient to him walk according to his ways and his plans Pastor I have areas God is called to break any curse any stronghold any addiction over your life but your possession is based on your obedience James chapter 1 verse 25 says this but you must never stop looking at the perfect law that sets you free God will somebody say God will tell you never real quick God will tell your second choice God will tell your third choice God will the Bible says God will bless you in everything you do God will bless you in everything you do God will bless you in everything you do God will bless you in everything you do God will bless you in everything you do somebody needs to grab a hold of that right now God will bless you in everything you do it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter the circumstance God will bless you in everything you do God I'm standing strong and firm on your word I'm not going to the left I'm not going to the right here's what I want to tell you you may not be invited to some things you may not be able to come to some stuff people may not consider you to be a part of what they want you to be a part of but here's what I'm saying God will bless your obedience God will bless you when you don't move and he says wait on the Lord and be of good courage for he shall strengthen your heart what's happening I look boring but I'm not born why because I'm being obedient and obedience means he'll open up the windows of Heaven report on a blessing and you and I even have room to receive he says God will bless you in everything you do somebody say if I knew there was something I knew there was something I knew there was a catch it's as if you listen and somebody say Anne yeah because we like to separate stuff like we would have put a commentator listen Okay I heard but the listen is followed with the obey listen and obey don't just hear on Sunday and forget on Monday listen and obey don't just hear me and then forget today your possession is next it's already written it's already declared the Bible has already said it's yours it's already framed and created in what your life is going to be so you're already successful he said I'll give you good success somebody just say I want good success I've been telling you to talk to the neighbor but you need to declare that in your life I want good success I want good success on my children I want good success in my family I want good success in my marriage I want good success single I want good success in my job I want good success so we're called to listen and obey and I believe that you're called to possess your next thing
