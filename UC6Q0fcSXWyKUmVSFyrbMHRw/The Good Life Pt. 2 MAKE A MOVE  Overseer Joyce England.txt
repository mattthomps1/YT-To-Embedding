[Music] our series is The Good Life and how many want to live the good life I know I do I'm gonna just give you a secret before I I read this scripture I'm living it now that's not a cocky statement it's a decision and I was offered the invitation to live that kind of life and I thank God for opening a path so I could because the path that I wasn't when I was blowing it royally we may get a chance to talk about that but let's read the scripture that coincides with our series The Good Life the scripture says the thief comes only to still and kill and destroy I have come that they may have life and to have it to the full that's not some ordinary kind of life that's not a mundane life that's life to the full and I don't think we hear a lot of people talking about that kind of like we hear about all other kinds of life but what's life to the full what does that mean what does that look like how would that impact me how would that change my my my sure what would it look like if I lived life to the full but let my community look like living life to the full Jesus came that we could live life to the full we're going to talk about that today we don't want to take a moment to pray there are no words that I really could say to express my heart to you but in this meteor attempt this morning I want you to know that we acknowledge your presence and we bow before you today for you are the true and living God that made the heavens the Earth and everything in it you know the way that we're supposed to go this morning you know what needs to be covered what needs to be said what should not be said and I say to you this morning we just turn everything we commit everything over to you right this moment the atmosphere because admitted to you our ears we committed to you our understanding we commit it to you the music we committed to you and most of all God we want to commit Our Lives to you this morning because we really want to live that good life we honor you amen the thief comes to still kill and destroy and the scripture says but I have come that you might have life I don't know anybody that ever told me that in all my years I'm coming your way Joyce because I want you to live the best life possible maybe my mother thought it I don't remember her saying it but maybe she thought it maybe my father thought it had really good parents that looked out for us but someone that that is really caring about who I am and the type of life that I live not having their own agenda that we can get together and the two of us can can can I think the world a lot today is Bill sometimes you're talking about building some something and we don't even know how to do it we don't have directions we we we depending on Siri and her family it says Siri can you open the door Siri can you turn the lights on Siri and if you don't like her voice she got family members right you can switch it up if we don't have Siri we have a GPS don't live out leave home without it so we don't leave our phones because we depend on these things to guide us in our daily walks and the things that we do but what about guiding Us in to the best life possible things just only last for a while the novelty of things wear off quickly you want the car you get the car what happens huh you you want the coat I wanted a fur coat one time God only knows why but I wanted a fair Copeland's house I've got the fur coat I remember one time coming home and throwing that fur coat on a bed or somewhere but wanted it you know we want things and we think those things will satisfy our longings and our desires but you have a soul that cannot be satisfied by things yeah stayed with me this morning and we try to satisfy that inner longing because we got the man we got the woman we got the money we got whatever else is it that we need we got it but still you find those times you you're to yourself and still not quite satisfied somebody will come along and say you ungrateful you got all of that and you're still not happy we're not happy because our soul is dehydrated and it's thirsty and it's longing and we are not feeding it [Applause] and and the life that Christ came that we should live it's not taking us where we need to go and when we are in sync with the will of God and the way of God we are moving where he has us to move and where he has you to move you're going to make a difference I don't care where it is you're born to make a difference I don't care who's there you will make a difference doesn't matter how you look doesn't matter how tall you are light you are doesn't matter how much money you had does it doesn't matter with your education it doesn't matter if something is not perfect or in your body because you know we all have that that's not perfect if I do this if I do that enough it'll get perfect you can only tighten up those boots but so much I'm just saying keep looking back on it man not twice it's just never enough it's just never enough for us Jesus is saying to us today come with me let me show you the way to A Life That's fulfilling a life that satisfies a life that makes a difference a life that leads you into a wholeness we need you you have something to offer you have something to offer and so it's looking at the word and and listening to Pastor because this series is blowing my mind and when he asked me to speak this morning I was thinking and I had been thinking about face quite a bit and I actually had put some time in last year to to get before God because I knew I needed some shifting in my life I needed things to line up uh that there was some easiness and easiness there and I I needed God to come in and and minister to me and I wanted to get closer so anybody that you want to get closer to you spend time with them you don't spend time with somebody and not want to get close you spend time with them you learn their idiosyncrasies you know how they operate if they come into the room and something's not right you catch it what's up what's wrong though don't tell me nothing's wrong something's wrong and know how you communicate even if it's not even verbal I know how Jesus is saying to you I want that kind of relationship with you so you're not walking around saying I believe God is saying something to me but I don't know what he's saying I believe God has something for me to do but I don't know what it is I don't quite know where I sit and he's saying let me lead you now I'm gonna give you I'm gonna say this to you very quickly and it's the truth I am not seeing the way he leads you would be without trouble because trouble makes you sit with that for a minute if you want to move somewhere if a flower wants to grow it's a disruptive process so the life that he wants to us to leave it comes with growth and maturity and it will be some disruption in your life but guess what even though there's disruption God knows how to move through chaos and bring life the the flower comes up out of the ground the dirt is it's not nice and you know how you put the plant in the ground then the dirt over it and then you put the little chips over it people come by and say oh your garden is so pretty but you don't want people to just look at that you want to see those flowers coming up because she had paid some good money for those plans and either you want flowers or you want fruit or you want you want something that's what God is saying to me I made you to produce something so this morning Jesus as I bring context was was in the area of Capernaum and he is the son of God John says in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was with God he was one and the same now I know sometimes we have problems with it but all of our life we accept things that we don't necessarily understand totally so when we get to Jesus don't go into all that well I don't know if everything how about using some faith and saying let me start there we're going to dissect everything about Jesus right everything which we're not even ready to understand if he gives us too much it's going to flatten us out it'll shut us down we can't handle it and so Jesus was moving because he he knew that he had come to get his life so that Humanity could live he understood that he knew that was his purpose and as he came he was walking around telling people look I'm the way I'm the truth I'm the life I I am I came here that you could live and that you can live abundantly and I'm going to give my life because where we are now we are disjointed there is a separation between humanity and God and when I come I'm coming to give my life so I can pay the price for sin and I can make sure that we are back together in Fellowship in Union so Jesus was here but his ways were unconventional you know we can miss out on things because they're unconventional doesn't look like we were used to seeing it doesn't act like it used to see it's not what everybody else does and what everybody else did Jesus was totally unconventional he ate with sinners people that were robbing Tax Collectors prostitutes he was eaten with people that were broke down poor he he moved around in the way that the religious folk couldn't even handle and so he's talking in him and he comes and he says I'm here I'm coming to bind up the broken heart set the captive free and he says as he moves around the prophets had spoke about him and and they said that when when the Savior comes when the Messiah comes in the one that has come to save the world when he come we'll know it because he will do miracles he will and so he was he was performing miracles and you know people will come where there's a miracle they may not grasshole of how honest you are true you are but if you can work a miracle you got my attention where when and so he had been doing these Miracles and he was coming off of the boat and in Capernaum and he the people had heard he was there so the word got out quickly and they came and they the scripture speaks about how they were crowded around him it was even hard for him to even move and he was on his way actually to Jerry's house who was a ruler of the synagogue because her his daughter was sick and he asked him will you come and heal my daughter and Jesus said yes I'll I'll heal her and he said and he was on his way he was going this way and this is where the scripture brings us this morning and Mark the fifth chapter and it says in verse 25 and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had yet instead of getting better she grew worse when she heard about Jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak because she thought if I just touch his clothes I will be healed immediately the scripture says her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was free from her suffering I have to stop there it didn't say she saw the blood stop it said immediately she felt the bloodstock in her body and she felt in her body that she was free from her suffering this God at once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him and he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my clothes can I say it real quick Faith touch who touched my clothes but Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it no I'm sorry I skipped this the disciple speaker that's why it pays to have Insight I mean you don't have Insight you say anything they answering the question too quick given their opinion so fast not not not even pausing for a minute to see what may be happening and spoke right up you see the people around if you see the people uh crowding against you his disciples answered and yet you ask you can ask who touched me all these people around here and you ask who touched me they own you and you ask who touched me but Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it then the woman knowing what had happened to her came and fell at his feet and trembling with fear told him the whole truth and his answer he said to her daughter your faith has healed you go in peace and be free from your suffering can you say Amen to the word let it just rest for a minute he called our daughter that's a personal kind of familiar kind of uh name a greeting that you would say to someone you would say daughter other than that if you're very impersonal and you don't know somebody who said I miss right or sir or something like that but he answered her he said daughter that meant she was in the family he had pulled her in close he knew what had happened in a moment in a crowd where it was chaos this morning I want to take you to three four things that faith will do because she operated in faith and if you want the good life you're going to have to operate and faith there are no ifs ands buts about it there's no other way around it you will have to operate in faith faith is confidence and Assurance in someone or something faith is not what you can see but what you believe because of the confidence and Assurance you have so that enables you to operate in a manner that you would not ordinarily operate in oh if there is water there and there is no pathway over it no bridge then I'm not going I'm not going to go in there faith will say but you can cross here you can walk on that one you can go there maybe no one else has but you can you just need to step out on it four things four things about faith that if you are willing to open your eyes and your ears this morning and be recepted to it I'm telling you you can lead here today living that best life that that great life that life that is full of vigor and full of purpose that's what we want so this is the first thing that I saw the first thing that scripture says is that she heard about Jesus she heard we have to hear because hearing the scripture says in Hebrews 11 and 6 without faith it's impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and he rewards those who earnestly seeks him there's just a baseline right there he's saying we have to hear there's something about hearing because when we hear we can take it in and then at least go the next step and make the decisions about what we heard but if you never hear anything you don't have an opportunity you you don't even know there's no choice when you hadn't heard anything you've got to hear first and one thing I've learned that once you hear something and you know it that's empowering right once I've read about it and I understand if I say to the ladies what menopause is all about and how it can wreck your life then I know what precautions to take I know what to do I can understand what's happened with my sleeping in the sweats and all the other stuff that goes along with it but I've gotta hear I've got to become knowledgeable and we hear we become knowledgeable she became knowledgeable about Jesus she heard about him I don't know all of what she heard but he was out here healing folks she heard that he was out there teaching he was talking about the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven he was talking about a life that was much different that they knew they were structured into living a life that was by the law and he came to fulfill the law so that those laws were going to be inside their hearts they could live it out they knew what it was to have this relationship so she had to what she had to hear the in hearing about it it gives you that again ability to make decisions she heard she heard the scripture also says that faith comes from hearing so when she heard it generated face when you hear it generates faith faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word about Christ faith comes from hearing so she was able to ascertain that Faith because she heard Captain here that's basic 101. if you're under that good life that great life that Abundant Life let's listen listen to the word read the word of God hear the word spoken hear the word sung put yourself in the position where the word is inundating your life the word the word makes us alive and so that word empowered her this is a woman that had been bleeding for 12 years she was broke didn't have any more money and she was worse off than what she was that's a terrible position to be in she she that but you know I've been in situations and having you that you you've been dealing with it for a long time and you just get tired of it and sometimes you just lose hope about it you have no expectations that it can get better you have no thoughts that maybe it could turn around there's nothing in your heart in your mind that's saying well maybe God could do something about this the doctors already said is stage four set it down the doctor already told me oh she's had a massive stroke so don't get your hopes up she may not walk or talk again that's what they told me stuck me to my heart when he said that about my daughter I couldn't be saying that about my daughter I want to tell you that I said oh yes I believe God I didn't do that it broke me for a minute and I was in that hospital room just me and him and she was laying on the bed I didn't know if she could even hear and I said I'm going to hold on to a little bit of faith that was just about as much as I could get out I'm gonna hold on to this little bit of Faith they released her to go to the nursing home with part of her skull removed a feeding tube in her her not being able to talk walk or anything the nursing home is on my back to put her in permanently but I had something in my mind there's something in my mind [Applause] there's something there in my mind and I just kept saying I know what they said but God can do anything I know what they said but God I know you can and that was six years ago and she is eating and breathing and working here in Ministry I'm living that kind of life this morning I'm living that blessed life this morning so I saw that I remember when they took the tube out of her stomach I said that's one down right then the speech pistiologist came in and started giving an ice and a spoon and then they said you know what I think we think we can feed her by mouth I said that's too down yes I did the third time one day I came in the room and I was telling I got my hair done and she rose up in the bed and said what I said that's three damn bless your name oh God bless your name he's the god of the impossibility so you got to hear about it care about him let's move the second thing that faith will inspire you the scripture says she heard about him and then it said she's thought about Jesus that he could heal her so once you hear something you need to start thinking about it like turning it over in your mind the good stuff you know you need to start talking to God about it can you really do it for me if you know my situation I haven't even told anybody about it but would you do it for me you know how cold my heart has gotten and you know what happened to me and I I can't even open up anymore but could you do it for me it's been a long time God but can you do it for me is it possible for me she started thinking about this thing and she heard the word I came to give you life and I came to give it to you in the fullness I came to raise a dead I came to Open the Eyes of the blind she was hearing about this good word when we hear about the word and the scripture says she's thought about the word the scripture says this for it is with your heart that you believe and are Justified and it's with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved as scripture says anyone who believes on him shall never be put to shame he doesn't disappoint you don't have to worry about if I put my trust in him he won't come through maybe he won't come through the way you want him to come through [Music] he does that I said earlier he's an unconventional God he does that so we don't depend on ourself he does that so that we don't get cocky and don't come to him about what we need and where we need to go in life and who we are he does he says I I heard you but I'm going to grow you this moment I'm going to grow you and when you come out what you're asking me for that won't even be what's on your mind cause I'll take care of that in a way you didn't expect but also I'm gonna move you up in the relationship [Applause] so we have to think about it the scripture says meditate on the word day and night scripture tells me that means like ruminating over and over you know how we think of some stuff over and over that we should not if you feed it it becomes real if you feed it it will continue if you feed it that's what you believe so we we want to make sure that we're when we hear something also that we we think about what we are hearing because everything we hear isn't something that we should be ruminating over meditating over allowing to sit in my in our minds I found out let me explain this to you I found out when I went into the bathroom that I always my mind would always go to this certain thought and I said well why does it happen when I come in the bathroom I hadn't noticed it before but then I thought to myself I said oh no no we're going to change that we're going to put in another line of thought because that's not going to take me down the road I need to go I just sit and leave it there but that's just how it is and I'll just I said no we're not gonna I'm gonna do something about what I'm thinking we have to do something about it let's go to number three Faith takes action it said she heard she saw it and then she touched Jesus garments she touched it she'd already said in her mind if I could just touch it he doesn't need to touch me I just need to touch him she was talking about touching the lowest place on him and that was at this garment she didn't say I had to put my hand on his shoulder or on his back she didn't have to do any of that because her faith in him was so strong she knew that wherever she touched him that it could work in her behalf Jesus is saying just Reach Out And Touch Me I'm here on your behalf I'm not worried about where that touches or how I just needed to be a sincere touch because I care about you touch Reach Out And Touch you have to take action you have to take action rare we she touched Jesus garment the scripture says in James in the same way faced by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead we don't want to have dead faith we want to have a live faith because live faith will take us in the presence of God life Faith will help us to live that good life are you living that life today I'm just putting it out there before I go to my last Point there's a kind of life that is not like any other life that anybody could ever offer you there's a life where the God will take you to places and things that you never thought about let me move to my fourth point the fourth thing when we talk about faith faith leads the way Faith makes room she communed with God this is what the scripture says come to me just come to me all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads I will give you rest because my servants learned from me I am gentle and free of pride you will find rest for your souls for your soul this morning when we look at this scripture we see that when she got there and she touched him a faith touch will get Jesus attention I don't care where it is I don't care what's happening I don't care if you're sitting in the midst of chaos and everything is just upside down what I want to tell you is that God will touch you right in the midst of Chaos you can speak to him right there and do you know God will say I hear you I got it don't worry I got it you think maybe I don't I got you doesn't matter what they're saying I got you doesn't matter how deep the hurt is I got you doesn't matter what they meant to do to you I got you facing me not in yourself it even wasn't even faith in what you could do because what we've seen is she could do nothing but because she had faith faith behave her energy Faith gave her power Faith gave her Insight Faith gave her everything she needed to get there and Touch the Hem that was a lowly place she humbled herself and said all I left you just let me touch the hill I know that I I could be healed this morning I'm going to say to you he's here for you there's a vibrant life that you're supposed to live I'm not saying that the life is without trouble because in this life the scripture says we shall have trouble but take heart yeah take heart I've already overcome trouble yeah I understand about trouble I understand and I've already prayed for you that your faith will fail you not this morning Jesus makes room whatever may be happening he's making room for you today whatever is going on in your life he's making room to you today I end this prayer I mean in this message this morning this one thing the last night I was home with my daughter and the message was ruminating in my heart and in my spirit and just going over and over and and I sat down and talked to her about what what it was I was going to speak on and I felt the Lord had given me and she was sitting there and she said you know she was I had problems she has when she had a stroke she impact the right side and so her leg you know she wears a brace and has uh impacted her walking and she was just saying to me how she was tired of the brace and how her feet were hurting and her leg was hurting and I had such compassion for her because her parent feels when a child feels and I and and she said you know Mama it just hurt and I immediately the face I had in God shifted me okay it shifted me and I said wait a minute wait a minute this face I'm talking about I believe in the power of the Living God I sifted in my mind from feeling sorry to exercising faith and when you exercise faith in God he is faithful to you I jumped up I went and got my oil I'm old school I carry blester I I buy oil [Music] and all is in my house people come to my house to get prayed over every year with that all so I re-up when necessary took that all from out the basement I said Marcia the power's not in the oil the power is in God faith in God but I said in the scriptures they've used the oil as it was a medicinal kind of a way of you know the healing they believed that the olive oil was ahead we were helping the healing to facilitate and I got that all I put that all in my head y'all and I start rubbing the leg I said in the name of Jesus I picked up our leg and put it in my leg and I started rubbing my feet I said you can do anything I said I don't care if it's been six years you can allow her to walk without the brace and I'm declaring it out of my mouth thank you she started weeping and I'm throwing up my hands and I said I know you're good I don't know when you're going to do it maybe you'll have us to wait I said but I'm not budgie I won't move from this spot they said she wouldn't talk they said she wouldn't walk now I'm saying she's gonna walk without the brakes hey she's to walk without the brakes I declare she's gonna walk without the priest you too have a right to speak to God by faith and declare that which you can't see as though it already was open your mouth and declare it speak it out to him Don't Be Afraid don't be hopeless don't think there's nothing to it sometimes you just gotta say it out of your mouth I want her leg here I want my family restored I want my son out of jail I want my children help I need you to heal my heart of unforgiveness I need you Lord remember face will get you there you have to make a move though and I need you today to think about making a move of Faith towards God that's the way to that good life
