foreign we're gonna get into the word of God open up your Bibles to John 18 and I don't know if I can get a little bit more in the monitors or a little bit a little bit more basic maybe I need to speak there we go okay maybe I need to speak closer into the mic but I'm just really excited to be here and I got a word man I heard that there are two things going on here in this season and those two themes you've got a prayer theme which is build a fire raise your hand if you knew that [Music] this is in a series titled unfinished business I just threw that out to make you laugh because I know you talked about with that word but but he's in a series called unfinished business and I and I want to just I want to come from this passage here in John 18. go to go over to John 18. I want to unpack some things but then I also want to this this today this word today is going to be topical but it's going to be prophetic I was told that you're one of your mantras here our note takers are World Changers so I want to invite you to take copious notes today take some copious notes if you're not a note taker you don't have a custom or culture of taking notes maybe it's your first time to the mixed Church man pull out your phone and just open up a text message and just begin to take notes I also want to honor the hospitality team the security team the praise team the band everybody that's just just loved on us and and just welcomed us to Baltimore it's been an amazing and amazing time we've had [Music] I want to prophetically release this and and I pray you received this there's a reason why the Lord brings prophetic voices to houses anytime God brings a prophetic voice to a house that's outside of your lead Pastor your leadership it's to confirm and affirm the direction that a church is getting ready to go in and so I'm thinking about the significance of this moment the Lord brings a prophetic voice to Baltimore to to minister to the mixed Church who just happens to be in a series called unfinished business and then you've got this prayer series called build a fire is anybody excited about where you're about to go watches on the Sunday I get here you have communion and so God is like mixed church are you going to be committed are you going to come into Covenant with what I'm about to do in this church this is what God is asking mix you going up you're already up but you're going higher when I say you're going up I'm just meaning there's another level test the person that you say there's always another level and I know for many of you you're thinking about numerically in real estate and finances I'm talking about we're starting with you in your heart we took communion but you took communion and so God says I'm gonna do some internal Ascension some some I'll do some real work inside your heart so that you can have the capacity to Bear what I do publicly but first I need to do some things privately in your heart so we're going to touch on Building A Fire we're going to touch on um uh unfinished business and I pray that as you guys going to next Sunday man you just set a blaze like I know you will be and you already are in Jesus name it's just time for another level so is we're going to open up in John 18. I'm gonna start at verse one start at verse 1 my assignment is John 18 verse 1. now I'm going to be jumping all over the place I'm going to be jumping all over the place but let me get inside anybody want the title now raise your hand if you want to title now or you want to raise your hand if you if you want to wait say I want to wait give me to tell me at the end anybody ever heard of uh delayed but not denied yeah no no don't clap because that's that's a cutesy title I want to flip it Mick the mix is a disruptive Ministry they don't they don't play by the rules they walk in temples and turntables over okay uh uh when I say what I mean by that is the mix is not here to blend in so so I don't want to say uh delayed but not denied I want to say denied but not delayed it's quiet because you never heard it right how many of you heard that before hey good this is fresh it's fresh for me because he just gave it to me I'm like denied but not delayed what do you mean if I'm denied how can I get well denial this perspective denial is two-dimensional I can be denied or I can deny and so really what I want to do is step into this conversation about the things that you have been in denial about the things of God that you have rejected in your personal space and so you've rejected these things you've been in denial about no takers you can start taking notes right now you can you can start writing some things down that you're in denial about and watch this I just want to pray a quick prayer while you're writing some things you've been in denial about father bless this he that comes in the name of the Lord may they receive this word in Jesus name amen amen so what have you been in denial about what have you been to denial about what have you rejected before I even get into the text in John 18. how many times were you prophesied to and I said I see you teaching I see you leading there's this business you nah not me how many of you were called to do something in the middle of a pandemic and you rejected it because you didn't know if you would make it out of the season so you were more concerned about position than identity I'm just wondering if anybody here has rejected anything just just raise your hand if you've ever rejected something that God spoke over your life and you said no God I don't want it I I I I don't need that it's the wrong season I'm not prepared I want to speak from the topic than not denied but not delayed make sense I'm excited to be here watching my clock I'm excited to be here deny but not delay I want you to sound it as loud as you can on the count of three one two three denied but not delayed denied but not delay let's unpack this John 18 verse 1. I'm gonna go here and when Jesus has spoken these words I'm going to be exegeting and just extrapolating different things verse by verse I'm not going to read a verse and go into I'm gonna I'm gonna go with you verse by verse can we do that shout yes okay it says when Jesus has spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedar and it says where was a garden in which he entered and his disciples and it says in Judas also which betrayed him knew the place for Jesus oftentimes resorted to their with his disciples I'm coming out of KJV if you're reading something else it might read a little different but we all in the same room amen verse 3 says Judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons now interesting and interestingly enough in verse 18. can I preach this can I teach this can I can I can I can I grab extract some things from the here you know this is not an error on Jesus's part but be careful who you allow to be with you when you're broken and you've got a specific place that you go be careful because there's there's some people that are not within your best interest it's not advantageous of you to tell everybody where you're going and what you do when you're broken when you're bleeding I just want to kind of just say that real quick but it says it says verse four let's jump to verse four Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come up to him went forth and said unto him whom do you seek and it says they answered him Jesus of Nazareth saith unto him I am he he says I am he and Judah also which betrayed him stood with him notice that Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane and he knows he's about to die yet he does not lose his identity in other words they say where are you who is she and Jesus says I am he the word of God is for instruction and correction I'm just wondering can I admonish you can I encourage you have you ever rejected who God called you to be because you were not where you wanted to be have you ever said and you looked around I'm a pastor so I'll just you know have you ever looked out you know we have a we have a beautiful crowd in Cleveland but what if it was only 10 people would I say now God damn it that ain't no man I ain't uh that's not me I'm not PMT by the way I go by PMT I'm not PMT how many people are so great hands have you ever been in a place where you were used you didn't see the fruit watch me that you wanted to see when it's not how I thought I fought by the time I was 45 I'd have a house and a car and you know I you know I'd be an accomplished Authority in this realm and you know I'm just saying I thought I would be able to you know what I mean have a couple records of one of my belt on a couple of you know that's not what's going on and oftentimes the reason why is because of the decisions that we've made and the people that we've tied ourselves to the people that were supposed to be assignments have become your assassin the people that you were assigned to help they're hurting you when you were supposed to help them but they're hurting you and you've tied to people and and you've got a bunch of people in your life and most of them don't even know how to pray I'm not talking about mixed Community everybody here should know how to pray I know but you got people that don't go to the mix that don't know how to pray and they got a different way of handling pressure they Buckle Under Pressure their substance is not the Holy Ghost their substance is the vice the woman the substance look at this look at this let's let's just go deeper somebody say go deeper and so he says verse 5 says he answered and said him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said unto them I am he and Judas also which betrayed him stood with them as soon as he had said to them I am he they went back and they fell on the ground are you seeing the same self and she and they all fell back was that good enough or you want me to fall on my back I am here I know who I am right I'm not prideful I'm aware I got to know the difference between having pride and arrogance and just being aware of who I know who I am I'm just wondering if we look at the text and we see what's possible when I walk in identity who has to fall back it's amazing how we dumb ourselves down and we become somebody we're not just so we can be accepted by people who are not assigned to us Jesus said all right and he I don't care if I'm in the Garden of Gethsemane I don't care if I'm about to die I will not Buckle under pressure huh purpose is bigger than pandemic Christ is bigger than crises let's let's go deeper let's just go come on let's just read we just having fun in scripture amen we can have fun and be transformed all in the same moment laugh and cry all in the same 30 minutes look at this and so he says in verse 7 and he asked him he says whom seek ye and he they said Jesus of Nazareth verse 8 says Jesus answered and said I have told you that I am he if therefore you seek me let these go their way there's some stuff that I gotta do that only I can do everybody that's tied to me doesn't have the capacity doesn't have the with doesn't have the death don't have the prayer life some of you are about to go through something and it's not bad it's just that it's going to go through something so that God watch me can get all all the glory you didn't hear me mix her listen to me watch this about 100 of you about to get this there's something that's going to happen in your life that's new that your degree did not get you it's no experience it's no connection it's no purpose partner no prayer partner I said something's about to break off in your life because you just know who you are and who God is and because you did not fold in the garden you're gonna get up and say no no his grace did this it's only by his Mercy that this happened I don't even have the intelligence I don't have the IQ I don't have the resources I am not resourceful I am not disciplined I'm not consistent he's Christ open up this door how many of you want to just stand real quick and just shout his grace only by his Mercy only by his grace only because of his love only because you thought that we were doing it and God's about to move us to another ship in another building and another business and another family member is about to get saved there are people that are tied to you that are about to get saved through Angelic assistance and not even because you fasted for it the Bible says that angels are ministering Spirits assigned to The Heirs of salvation you've got Angelic muscle behind you you didn't earn Max somebody stand up on your feet this business denied but not delayed I'm going I'm going somewhere watching my time floor director please don't punch me in my mouth I know the mixed church is not violent but just in case there's some people who are still praying and binding the spirit of anger please thank you for your patience I promise I came six hours to give you this verse 11 says then Jesus note let's jump let's jump let's jump to verse 9. he says he says that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gave us me I have lost none he says verse 10 said then Simon Peter having a sword in his hand he smoked the high priest servant and cut off his right ear in the servant's name was malcus see there are some people who are not spiritually equipped to handle Where You Are and they would do things in your life to cause you to forfeit your position cause you to question your identity cause you to question God because they don't have the oil the fire Pastor Marcus they don't have the fight they don't have the consecration some people don't have the discipline they don't have the favor to walk with you into this place where you are and where you're going and so Peter is trying to cut off something listen stop trying to pray every storm away scripture says that tribulation worketh patience if everybody that prays that's tied to you is always trying to pray you out of something and not through something you've got the wrong caliber of intercessors around you where you're going next Church you need people that can pray you through it's too cute I said you should praise God for the people that are coming that can pray ah can pray before I make my prayer point I said praise God for people that can pray pray pray can get a prayer through not a prayer to a prayer through ah this means I can be tied to an intercessor where God not only heard their prayer but he answered their prayer because the oil that's on their life and so how many of you been tied to people they're always trying to wish stuff to not happen to you you know I just pray God's best no maybe this is a thorn in my side that I need so that I can know that his grace is sufficient for me so so Peter which we're going to deal with Peter Peter slices the priest's ear off him and this is because you got to make sure that the people that are tied to you have Heaven's perspective for you see you're still looking at this thing as why is this storm here and Heaven's like why won't you walk on water okay okay you want to know the revelation of the walking on water I want to hear Revelation make sure start back to mix okay so yes you want to know one of the revelations there are dimensions to Revelation here's one of the revelations I love this and this is kind of like a preluded Resurrection Sunday watch this in the Old Testament Moses now about 90 of you are going to shout I wish the whole band was up as you can praise break in the Old Testament Moses parted sees in the New Testament Jesus walked on cease in other words this is my demonstrative display listen you're not focus watch this he wants to show you that now you got me this ain't Old Testament presence upon you this is New Testament presence in you and so what they had to walk around what they needed me to move next Church who am I talking to the New Testament believer has the anointing to walk on everything in the New Testament is a slap in the old testament's face to some measure pieces of Revelation let me say that are in the New Testament is it let me go hood for is it clap back for the Old Testament I don't believe you PMT prove it if ate the fruit married delivered Jesus and so where a woman failed a woman fulfilled they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years complaining about the food that was given them Jesus came on the scene and went through the Wilderness for 40 days with no food and say while you were complaining about angel food Manna I did it with no food I'm I'm here listen to me mix church this is a prophetic release what you're about to do has not been done there is not a system there is not a conference there's not a strategy for some of the things that you're about to do there's no notes you took it's only the power of God thank you see some of y'all want to get on stage when you have your moment and you want to be like my mentor God like no my God my God no no your Mentor is not going to get the glory no it's the power of God it's the power of God I've got to move expeditiously here but let's continue to follow here we go look at this he says I'm a little old school you know I like Hallelujah you know sometimes Hallelujah okay look at this and and in verse verse 11 everybody say 11 11 11. he says and then said Peter put up thy sword this sent Jesus to Peter put up that sword and thy sheath and the cup which my father hath given me he said shall I not drink it see Jesus sees the value in his relationship with Peter and so he has the difficult conversation with him and a lot of us we don't know how to have difficult conversations when there is no healthy relationship without difficult conversations I got to be able to call out your era and hypocrisy I have to be able to call out that you are blocking this breakthrough that what I'm anointed for you want me to abandon and still keep you in the circle are you seeing this Peter was amongst the men who could not stay up and pray when Jesus said if you could just watch and pray that's all he said just just man just watch and pray and you're sleeping while I'm praying and I'm sweating profusely how many of you are excited this is real serious prophetic word for the mix watch this I'm going to say something to you some of the next people that are coming to the mix are not musicians or singers or teachers or authorities and this nature of that Niche God's about to start sending intercessors this is why your pastor he already sees it which is why he's got you in this prayer series called build a fire mixers don't you see what God's about to do in this building because God told him and I didn't even have a conversation about this wherever you're going you can't get there without prayer I see see it it's a different generation that understands the power of prayer but are there any people that are from the old days as we say I know this generation prays I know we're anointed but there were also anointed back in the day and so I'm just asking are there any people that's like 50 enough that knew what prayer did that your nephew was in the cartel and then he ended up at the Friday night Revival and he got filled with the Holy Ghost and baptized his whole life changed his sister changed his mom changed everybody came to Jesus because that one woman prayed and then Grace collided with faith all right all right gotta move here we go look at this watch this he says he says then the band of the captain the officers the Jews took Jesus and bound him and it says in verse 13 and led him away and it says away Anna's first for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas the high priest the same year and so we we then moved to verse 15. everybody say denied but not delayed to denied but not delayed denied but not delayed see Peter has a history of denying Jesus what I love about this is that if you look through our scripture Peter consistently denies Jesus in so many capacities but one of the beautiful things about Peter is that he got a revelation of who God was who Jesus was he says who did they say that I am and some people name some prophets and some people named this and that and her her and excuse me him and this guy and that person and God said and Peter said in other words you are the you are the Messiah you are the truth you you are God manifested In the Flesh and he said okay and so Jesus says here Upon This Rock it's not just Peter translated Petra translated rock it also means upon this truth I'm going to build my church and so anytime you catch a revelation the enemy is going to send an arrow to challenge the Revelation that you received you understand the the the defense of the Demonic realm okay the spiritual warfare this is why there's no church old school new school that can do anything without intercession the Bible says that accept the Lord build the house which means I can build something but it's not the Lord's House and so I love I love I love I love this unfinished business somebody say Peter's got some unfinished business Peter's got unfinished business I'm so grateful that I serve a God that doesn't leave me in the garden where I cut the high priest ear off I'm so grateful that I serve a God that can see past the flaws he can see past the era he can see past the conditioning he can see past the cultural limitations he can see past my proclivity to be loyal to the limitations of the people around me and not have hard conversations with them that will challenge them to level up but you notice your circle should evolve like why do you still want to believe metaphorically speaking that Batman is still Batman sometimes Batman got to become Superman in a matter of two years it's like yeah that's my friend metaphorically speaking Yeah that's my friend Batman what now Batman's Superman why is it that we want to keep people in the same thing why is it that we don't know how to go from bro to Mentor right or sister to spiritual mother why is it that everybody just got to stay the same why is it that why is it that we amputate people out of our Lives because they made a mistake instead of realigning them somewhere if you're a liar then I won't tell you any I won't give you any that I don't want to get out but I'm not gonna stop having lunch with you I'm just not going to say anything to you that really matters that I want to get out I don't amputate a lie I'ma keep you in my life but I'm a compartmentalize you in a different place I'm so grateful that I serve a God that's a good idea but we serve a god that is consistent with this ideology he does not throw Peter away even though Peter denied him the core idea of this conversation mixed church that I'm having with you is that even though Peter denied Jesus Jesus did not delay his that that's that's praiseworthy not because I'm anointed but because all the times you denied Jesus you gave him a million reasons to throw you away yet your purpose has not been denied the baby out of wedlock did not delay you the husband you should have never married and had to get the divorce I did not delay you the mistake that you made when you abandoned your assignment in the garden in the valley when you allow demonic pressure to get the best of you it did not delay you somebody said I'm not delayed I'm not delayed I'm not delayed high five 17 people shut up not to lie I'm not delayed yeah yeah yeah they cut me from the team but I'm still on the team because even though I used to be the quarterback I don't mind being the water boy for a season to prove that God is so good that he could take me from quarterback to water boy back to quarterback just wonder if there's anybody in this place that do my shouting because you are not healing there's no curse there's no hexa there's no ill word against you there's no weapon I'm not the leader I'm not delayed I know I denied you but I'm not delayed I I know I denied you but I'm not delayed your blood's too powerful to be intimidated by demonic strategy your blood your blood and that's why as soon as the praise team began to sing about the blood something about the blood somebody's shouting still works it still works it still works it still works it still works it still works I can still declare the blood of the light so we find here this is Simon Peter follow verse 15 Jesus and so did another disciple and the disciples the disciples said unto them to the high priest and went with Jesus into the place of the high priest verse 16 but Peter stood at the door without then went out the order of disciple which was known unto the high priest and he spake unto her and kept the door and brought in Peter and so a damsel calls Peter out now now we already saw Jesus prophesy to Peter and said listen before the rooster crows three times you're going to deny me you serve a God that already knows what you're going to do this is not a license to sin because Jude 24 says now unto him that is able to keep you from falling just because he knows what I'm about to do doesn't mean I've got to fail because I want my next testimony to be that I cried because he kept me and not because I denied him how many of you want to cry because you didn't quit how many of you don't want to just keep praying repentance tears how many of you lost your tears and you're gonna get them back today see one of the beautiful instruments of redemption for Peter was that it said after he denied him three times he said he walked away and he wept bitterly and some of you have gotten too cool and conservative with God and God said when you go cry out in your closet when you go get in my presence when you go stop talk stop talking about how Grandma prayed and you're gonna stand on Grandma's shoulders and pray differently it's not better it's different with the same anointing see to every man is give it a measure of Grace you will not finish yet you've got a Grace you haven't tapped into yet you've got an anointed you have a chapter two yet you got a power you have a chapter in two years yeah we got backup generators in your backyard you ain't even cut them on yet are you still complaining about an air conditioning unit that went out when God slacked the whole time you had forced air you had an entire duck system in your house and all you needed to do was hit the thermostat are we seeing this so Peter denied him he denied him when he met him when he was teaching on the Seas and he said Peter won't you go out a little further and once you cast out your nest and he said no man he said we tired we toilet all night come on Peter has a history of denying him he's cutting off ears he's saying man I'm not worthy for you to wash my feet I'm not I'm not seeing everybody seeing the landscape of how much Peter denied denied denied but God did not delay delay delay and this is when we're getting to that fire as I come to the crescilla of this moment stay with me look at this I'm going to jump down here look at this and so Peter denies him so Peter denies him that he whips weeps bitterly but let me just say this can I can I brag about my God can I break up can I brag about my God no seriously can I brag about my God let me let me brag about God let me brag about God in case you didn't know because there's this narrative that Christianity and and and the USA is centered around you but but you need instruction and you need correction so we do have to end up talking a lot about your life but we also need to talk about how good God is we need to talk about not just what's around you but what's in you and I want you to know in case you forgot that God is loving that God is a god that is faithful and righteous I want you to know that God is powerful and he's Mighty I want you to know that God is Sovereign and he's just I want you to know that God is compassionate and he's gracious is there anybody who can identify with Peter and you're needing another measure of Grace that you haven't always figured it out that your resume ain't deep enough that your connections are powerful enough is there anybody here that understands that they've got a flawed past but a brilliant future and it's not because you earned it it's because you've already paid the price for it your future is expensive but somebody already paid the price the only reason why you can have unfinished business and finish it is because of the grace of God let me let me let me I gotta move here look at this watch this look look at this oh I want to go here let me go to this last piece here I want to give you this we know that there was an outpour in the book of Acts right and and it's interesting because Peter preached the day of Pentecost and you're talking about building this fire you see the fire surrounded them in the Old Testament the fire accompanied them in the Old Testament but in the New Testament the fire is in US are we seeing this and we need fire we need the refiners fire because that fire is a reformer that fire is a disrupter the fire of God is a consumer and it consumes everything that's not like God in your heart this is why when Shamika got up I hope I said I said it right or was it son Rica sharmika when sharmika got up and she said come on just began to pray and if there's anything in your heart that needs to be removed if there's anything that you just believe has just been in your way just begin to pray and ask God to remove it did anybody pray and do you want to pray again because mixed Church where you're going you're going to need to learn how to pray like you've never prayed before not just corporately which you already know that but privately some of you don't have a designated place to pray he keeps meeting you at the kitchen sink because he's good but God said get in a corner find a place in your basement find a place in your attic have a place somewhere where you go to pray and you seek the face of God does anybody want the mantle of prayer to descend upon them I want everybody on the count of three to shout Lord let the mantle of prayer descend upon me one two three and so and so we see in Matthew 3 and 11 it says indeed I indeed baptize you Matthew 3 and 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he said there's somebody that's coming that is mightier than I whose sandals I am not worthy to carry and it says he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire everybody say fire make search where you're going you're not going there without fire Pastor Marcus already knows it do you know it see because getting on the six o'clock prayer line can be an option or a command right because a church has got to go from a hospital to a family to an army mixed church about 100 of you are going to get this mixed Church your past Hospital your past family it's army time you know why because families don't take territory armies do they not they not they're not they're not even tapped in but my mom owned a chain of burgers I'm not talking about that kind of territory I'm talking about territory in the spirit realm I'm talking about demonic forces that have had a stronghold on a corner and when you moved it to the neighborhood mixed church when God blesses you with your main campus I just a franchise I didn't say another business I said demonic pressure will be broken in the community addiction broken depression broken come on crooked Rose me straight your praise is still cute I'm just what is there anybody here that wants to see spells obliterated feathers shattered come on people in your family that have struggled under the pressure of poverty now they're walking in wealth and now they're walking in health and now you don't have to keep believing God for the money to fix something up you can get something that's already fixed up why I gotta stay in my great Zone here it is and so see the problem with many of us is that we have discarded too many Peters in our life we have thrown away too many Peters in our life John prophesied what what happened with Peter I want to I want to end here look at this look at this is so good look at this God's word is good PMT is just a servant watch this Acts 2 and 36 are you not going into Palm Sunday in Resurrection Sunday and are you not talking about building a fire are you not talking about you got unfinished business watch this Peter had unfinished business it didn't stop with the blessing it started with breakthrough he denied him in the boat he denied him in the garden he denied him at the dinner table when he said I got to go and die Peter and Peter said no no that will never happen to you come on Peter consistently denied and Jesus said get thee behind me Satan I prophesied that there are people coming into your life that are able to not just not destruction Pastor Marcus but take correction corrected and stay can you be told that you don't have the anointing yet but stay can you deny can you fuss shout and scream but stay Peter Peter says wow because he was mature enough to know that he did not call him Satan he was talking to Satan one of the one of the epidemics I would say in the Christian world is the virus of insecurity why can't I just tell you you're not good at something right now it doesn't mean you won't get good just because you failed at the dinner table while we were breaking bread doesn't mean that you're not going to preach on Pentecost and commemorate my death my burial and my resurrection I know you couldn't get it in target practice I know you did not get it in rehearsal but have you ever seen somebody flop in rehearsal but when the lights and the canvas turns on you said who on Earth is that they suck excuse me in rehearsal but as soon as they because they did not live somebody said I got up in this business I got up for this business you can stand in your feet I want you to start high-fiving people I got up for this visit I'm not finished yet my family's not finished yet my bloodline's not finished yet my local church is not finished yet my band is not finished yet our singers are not finished yet God's not done with my brand God's not done with favor God's not done with blessing you're still here I'm talking about you I'm talking about God I'm talking about what he's about to do in your bloodline it warrants something Beyond a golf clap Hallelujah is anybody in here really been through something I went through a season a little bit ago where I had a moment where I felt like I was losing my mind nothing immoral nothing illegal and it only lasted for just a moment but I felt like I was losing my mind but God kept me he did not deny me and I had people leave me because they could not handle my testimony is there anybody here that's excited about what God is about to do in your life even if people can't handle it if they can't handle it then you've gotten to a place in Destiny where God is just going to change the circle and so the Lord told me to prophesy he said prophesy over the mixed Church he said prophesy that there will be an outpouring at the mixed Church he says prayer team prepare yourself because the type of anointing that is descending on this house is probably already happening but they're going to be more Sundays to come where people are not going to wait for an invitation they're going to come running running to the
