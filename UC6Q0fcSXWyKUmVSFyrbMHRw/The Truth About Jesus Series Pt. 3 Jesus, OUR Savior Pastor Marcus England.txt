[Music] [Applause] [Music] come on somebody help me celebrate god in this place come on come on come on come on come on it's sunday sunday's the best day it's the best day because we get to celebrate all that god has done can you help me celebrate them just one more time can you give god the praise and glory that is due unto his name can you help me as a church stand to your feet and give god a praise can you in this section stand to your feet and help me give god a praise in this place come on if you have the ability my young people stand to your feet and help me give god a praise in this place somebody come help me get that roll right there and help them get up why because we're in the lord's house this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice i will be glad in it come on hallelujah oh glory to god listen i i want to let you know something the only way that we break the bond of what the enemy has over our city over our minds over our people is to move beyond what we feel and to move beyond what we want to do and so as a pastor i declare in this house that we will live in the freedom that god has called for us to live in and to walk somebody say in abundance in new life you got to learn how to walk in the newness of mind and life and thought so that you can see all that god has for you today so one more time help me celebrate our savior in this place [Applause] young people up again let's go come on come on come on has he been good to you has he been good to you has he been good to you do you know him has he been good to you come on [Music] one thing i understand is that we're here with purpose we hear understanding that god wants to do something in us through us and for us but we have to be at a place where we can receive everything that god wants to speak satan do and so as i keep pushing and pushing the envelope as your pastor what i am pushing you to do is move beyond the comfort zone of what you decided in your salvation to something greater of what you've decided to do beyond your salvation which is to become a true follower of jesus christ the bible says in john 10 and 10 for the thief comes to steal to kill and to destroy but jesus said i come that you might have life and have that life to the full but if we are not careful we will allow the enemy to consume our thoughts our minds and our emotions to be able to tell us that god isn't worthy of the praise that is due unto his name so one more time in this house help me declare in baltimore that god is good hallelujah hallelujah he is good he is worthy he is great [Applause] all right you can have your seat just tell your neighbor he's a nice guy he's a nice guy he's all right y'all don't have to worry [Music] sometimes you need somebody in your life to get you to where you want to be and it's not always with the option it's with the urgency that god wants to do something in us through us in for us and i believe today that i am excited i'm excited and what i believe that god has just been laying on my heart is just this spirit of clarity that we are called as a church to help people break through the barriers and the bondage that the enemy loves to keep on our minds our bodies but most importantly over our spirit and i believe that when we allow the holy spirit to reign to have his way we are a church that is as they would call it seeker sensitive so meaning we are really uh here to invite those who are unbelievers and don't know jesus but the idea is not to leave you at the place where you are the idea is to take you from your past to passion and purpose of full life in jesus christ and so i don't want to leave you where you are that you could feel good and come to church and say you know i did it for the day i want you to leave out and say god did something in me god did something through me and god did something for me and when that happens you'll come back again and say god whatever it is that you want to do i am available to you welcome to the mix my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i'm so grateful for those of you that are here in person and online we are so grateful to have you in the house and we're so grateful that you're a part of this moment um it's an exciting day y'all it's the the third sunday what happens on the third sunday is is that it's step three of growth track and so yeah we've got some amazing people who have joined the church but now they've moved from joining to be a part of not just consuming but they are now contributors to the dream team that we have here and so we're excited for those of you that have moved from membership to discovering your design in step two to step three which is to join a team to be able to connect with people that are like-minded so that god can use the giftings that are inside of you to see the purpose of the kingdom fulfilled and lived out through you so we're excited about that on today and then also y'all we want to let you know that registration is open for what baptisms on next sunday can y'all help me celebrate those that are getting baptized on next week yeah it feels good and we already have individuals that are lined up ready to take the next step of what god wants to do which is baptism baptism is an outward declaration of the decision that is made inwardly that says lord i am making this thing known that i am relationship with you today and we're grateful for those that are taking that next step if you've gotten saved if you have come to uh take a fresh start in christ and but you haven't moved forward and you're somewhere in a slump in your i want to say your spiritual journey i want to push you to take that next step that next step is baptism that next step is the feeling of the holy spirit and allowing god to do something transformative in your life open your notepads open your phones let's get into the word of god today get your bibles out we're in john chapter 18 on today and we are in our series the truth about jesus the truth about jesus and i believe today that i just want to open up some clarity i want to talk a little bit about who jesus truly is i i want you to get this revelation that you cannot do life without our savior you cannot do life without our savior now here we we we say that note takers are what here world changers note takers are world changers why do we believe that we believe that the information provided to you can bring movement and change only if used and used in application to your life and also we say readers are what leaders just tell your neighbor real quick you're a world changer and you're a leader [Music] john chapter 18 starting at verse 1 through verse 11 and it says this and when jesus had spoken these words it says he went out with his disciples across the book the brook christian and where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered it said now judas who betrayed him also knew the place for jesus often met there with his disciples so judas having procured a band of soldiers it says and some officers from the chief priests and pharisees went there with lanterns and torches and weapons then jesus knowing all if you have a bible that's a great place to underline then jesus knowing all that would happen to him it says he came forward and said to them whom do you seek they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus said to them i am he judas who betrayed him was standing with them when jesus said to them i am he the bible said they drew back and fell to the ground so we asked them again whom do you seek and they said jesus of nazareth jesus answered i told you that i am he so if you seek me let these men go this was to fulfill the word that had been spoken of those whom you gave me i have lost not one then simon peter having a sword drew it [Music] struck the high priest servant and cut off his right ear you didn't know the bible was so violent did you didn't you didn't know that this kind of stuff was happening it's not just in as the world turns but it's in the book of john it says the servant's name was malcus and the last verse verse 11 says so jesus said to peter put your sorrow into a sheaf shall i not drink the cup that the father has given me today i want to talk from the topic jesus our savior jesus our savior can we pray father in the name of jesus we thank you so much for this moment we thank you that you're our savior our lord our king for those of you who have accepted you father i pray today that someone would come to know you in a new way to have a new experience to have a new encounter with you but we love you we honor you and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much listen i want to give a big shout out to the people that make it happen here the people that went through step three and have joined the team can y'all help me celebrate our dream team in here come on y'all help me give them a a huge celebration thank you thank you so much as we're in this series and we're in week three talking about the truth about jesus the truth about who this savior is this bible that we read this book that we open up and that we sit sunday after sunday to be a part of knowing him better and better one of the things i want to let you know is that we're talking about a man named jesus one of whom was born of the bible says a virgin and came into this world to save us now if you want to be honest like me and you look at your life you know you need some saving if you want to be honest like me if you look at the world you can understand that this world needs some saving can anybody agree with that if you find out where you are where things have landed if you have found out where where you just looked on the news and you looked at the things that are happening across the world i'm pretty sure you can admit that we need a savior now if you're like me a savior can look different it depends on what it is depends on where you are in your life depends on what's happening some of us need a a financial savior we need uh somebody to walk in and to help us with the current state of where we are financially some of us we we we need an emotional savior anybody can can can know about that you need somebody to help you when your emotions is all crazy because you know you can be a little cray-cray sometimes when life be happening you can get a little off some of us need an emotional savior some of us need a relational savior because we can't keep a friend to save our life i like the idea of having a savior one that comes into rescue in our world we know a lot about rescue can i can i tell you we have built an entire movie industry on rescue marvel anybody a marvel fan anybody yeah come on look at that see adults that's what i don't even see the young people all adults say yes right here this is me is that the reason why you have disney plus illegally on your no i'm not going to go there but i just want to say this real quick i i want to talk to you about we all like this idea of a savior we like the idea of the superhero we i've grown up and and when i grew up we had superman and and and we had batman i'm not gonna go to dc right now i'm gonna stay at marvel so so so so so when i grew up i kind of understood we we got into this captain america and we got into iron man and and you notice all the movies started coming out they started looking real good y'all they they they started building series upon series and and i've spent all my money probably on every marvel series i can possibly get my hands on when my wife and i we were dating you know the the way i showed off was to go to the movies but what i tried to do and really showing off was go to the early movie because the early movie meant it was cheaper so it meant i could get more snacks to look like i was balling a little bit more than i actually was so i got cheap movie tickets but i i also went and got a lot of snacks to be like yeah this was a good day i took her out on a nice date you know what i'm saying i i took her to the movies and and so we really got into this place where we loved movies now i'm a little older so i don't know if you know about movies but i know about movies like real movies like back in the day when we had the vhs tape anybody know about that on the vhs it's not like this little modern day stuff that we got going on here on the vhs you could put seven movies on one vhs streaming was already created through vhs and when you put the little label on the vhs you would write with a very small ink pen all the movies it would be on there now i'm going to let you know part of my family was saved the other half knew jesus but maybe didn't know him like they should have and there was a little purple rain on there and and there was a little you know no you know we had like different movies and things on that and so i come from the age of vhs we we left vhs and we went to dvds i know dvds the problem with dvds they got scratched and once they got scratched it was a wrap then we went to blu-ray i skipped no i don't understand this i don't know what this is picture looks the same to me my tv is the same tv it's got a tube it's huge i'm not wasting any money on that then we got to streaming we started watching and we love the movies but one of the movies that we love is the avengers the end game it's the end game for me it's when it's all on the line it's coming you talking about in the movies popcorn you it's a three-hour movie so you have to buy pre-snacks movie snacks and post-snacks you know how that goes you you buy the stuff that you're eating while you're sitting there and you're going through and you're talking you chit chat with people and then when the movie starts you gotta find what you're gonna eat on and and then when you go from there you're moving to the next place where you're about two and a half hours into the movie because if you know anything about marvel in order to get to the end game it's gonna take a while three hours and five minutes at the end of it there's a savior iron man but he has to die in order for everything to go back to the way it was man broke my heart spider-man cry now i just want to let you know these people aren't real but for some reason i'm choked up in the movies i'm hurting oh god no not tony my heart is broken and i'm watching this and there's something about when people give their life for a greater cause that whether it's fiction or true our hearts gravitate towards an ultimate sacrifice we love superhero and saving movies so much that the avengers in game is one of the highest grossing movies ever 2.8 billion dollars that's a lot of money anybody can admit that anybody anybody start running out of zeros you don't even know how many zeros you never wrote two billion dollar check you start wait is there more it's a lot of money it's a lot of money when we're talking about a movie something that's not real something that is not true yet it captivates our heart can i tell you that there was something real that happened over two thousand years ago it wasn't a written script even though it was because it was the prophetic word coming into pass that the old scriptures let us know that there was a savior to come and this savior that was coming was coming to save a broken world that was broken by sin and that was messed up and we needed the savior named jesus here's what i want to let you know today is that if you understood how broken that you were when you entered into this world you would have been broken on the inside chasing after a savior saying i'm in need of something greater than what i have we need jesus we need him as our savior problem is is everybody likes their savior to look a certain way if i can if i can be honest we all like our savior to have a look to be a way to to to have a figure because the right formed savior can save me from what i need to be saved from if the savior is like i want him to be the problem in our culture is is that we need jesus to be like we want him to be and what we're struggling with is the savior that may be a savior but it's not the savior that we want to see and the pharisees and the sadducees and the religious leaders were so engrossed on where jesus came from his background his information who he knew how he knew it that they missed that he came to save i want to get you into this moment because what we're finding in the world is that we're all broken by all of our divisions if you see us we're a mix of people they're young people they're they're they're older people they're middle-aged people they're they're they're white people they're black people they're asian people they're people hispanic people from all over and all of us are trying to get a savior to fit in our box we got people fighting from revelations chapter one talking about he had he had legs like bronze pastor he's gotta be black and the question is can he be your jesus if he's black can we talk today we when you look at most of the pictures and jesus is painted you'll see a picture of a white man with a long hair and blue eyes and it's like that's your jesus and you're like no that's not my jesus because my jesus needs to look like me and the tension that we have is that we want a jesus that is in our preference base who will save us from what we want saving from not what we need saving from see we need saving from our sins not our opinions and can a jesus that doesn't look like me that could be controversial that could go against culture christians that could go against what i learned at my grandmama's church and what i learned in in in in back when i was a child can that jesus still save me and the question today i want to know is are you willing to allow jesus to save you even though he may not look and be the way you want them to be in a culture climate where things are a little bit tense and we're always on the edge and in a climate where we find ourselves always fighting for our opinion and our our our needs and and i talk about this in our church which is we have division because we're different and the difference is is i look different i have different thoughts there's different things that have impacted my background where i live where i stay what i do what i can have and the real thing about life is that everything is not equal the moments are equal relationships aren't equal finances aren't equal the way that we see life is not equal we all have had differences of the way in which we are able to comprehend this world but here's the problem we see it through our own eyes not the eyes of god and when we don't see through the eyes of god we miss what god is trying to say to us instead of what we're trying to say to god can i get to you real quick the problem that i've fallen to is that i am more about god fitting into my idea and mode so that i can serve him according to the way that i want to live but the problem is is that he is the creator and i am the creation when he is the creator and i am the creation i wait for his direction and then he lets me know what his will is the problem is is that we become so opinionated in our culture of what he looks like who he is what he should do the way that he should come is that we don't have a perspective to allow him to be god and god alone and if he could be god and god alone he could do in your life what you cannot do of yourself let me grab a hold of you your jesus is bigger than your sunday mornings your jesus is bigger than your worship songs your jesus is bigger than the ideas that you have formed into the box of your culture's identity sexuality mindset perspective jesus is bigger than your opinions your ideas your feelings your body desires your wills and your achings jesus is god when you come out of this notion that you have the ability to form and re-imagine who god is and to be able to restyle him to fit your comfort zone you don't understand what it is to be a disciple discipling is being molded not doing the molding happens when jesus doesn't fit into your profile what happens when jesus doesn't fit into your way of doing life what happens when you set your life up and jesus comes in to disrupt it because he says in his word i've come to make all things new the problem is with new is that we're so connected to used that we've interpreted used as new anybody ever been in a new car before anybody ever watched it smells different it has no numbers on on the dash you got like .5 and five miles just because we drove it up and drove it back any if you've ever been in new before you understand there's a difference with new new doesn't mean i have to settle in to the conditions that were pre ahead of what i thought new means that there is a new ground a new foundation a new place a new opportunity a there is a clearing out i don't have to build from what was i'm starting from a new place if you understood that then you would not try to have jesus build you on something used he could do something somebody say new tell your neighbor real quick he wants to do something new the problem with new is that i'm saturated with old and religion and i'm saturated with brokenness and sin and i'm saturated with anger and frustration and i'm saturated with sin and messed up perspectives and i'm so saturated that i'm only willing to allow jesus to build on what was and the bible says he wants to make all things new pastor i've got desires and things that i used to have he says guess what i can do something new but the problem is is when i put him in a box i condition him to be in the perspective of working off of what already is instead of him establishing what he already designed see here's what i want to get you to know is that god designed a plan and purpose for your life now i know you have found from different people an idea and thought process of who you want to be where you want to go what you want to do but the problem is is that we never know who god says we are unless he is able to give us clarity to who we are in creation oh i want i want to get this to you because it's so important because once you recognize it you understand how great your god is let's jump to verse six real quick because it says this when jesus said to them i am he the bible says as he was in this garden moving into his purpose he says i am the the bible says they drew back and fell to the ground they drew back fell to the ground drew back fell to the ground here's what he just revealed all power is in my hand if i wanted to stop this [Music] it wasn't hard he just spoke to the set of circumstances and he just said i am he the bible says they fell back because of the power of who he is when he said i am he he just wanted to let them know oh i can stop all this but the problem was is that he was so submitted to the will of the father that he didn't even have the option to stop it even though he had the power to stop it if you understand how great that is you'll understand the clarity behind even though you have the power to do something when you're submitted to the will of god you what submit to whatever he says do this text is a perfect picture to what absolute surrender looks like because while you have the power to do whatever you want to do the question is are you under the absolute surrender of the father so that he can do whatever he wants to do the problem with being saved is that you cannot be rescued unless you found yourself in a place of needing rescue and the problem that many of us fall into is that we don't believe we need rescuing you ever seen somebody managing their life before and they think they're doing great but you're on the outside like i don't think this is going as well as you think it is if you're a parent you tend to know about this our children are making these decisions you're like i don't think that's the best direction but if you go for it you go for it and when you're giving them advice what you're trying to say is to them i want to save you but i can only save what is willing to be saved see here's the thing let me tell you about church and christianity jesus is not forcing himself oh nobody wait listen when i was at the top of the service i'm like come on and worship the lord you don't want to worship him right now i just want to sit down i said come on and get up and he was like i don't feel like doing that i was like get off me like man i'm a kid up you're right he is good he has done a lot for me i probably should lift my hands guess who's doing that that's me guess what god's not doing he is not begging for your praise or your worship or your glory or your honor he's sitting there like oh don't worry about it don't worry about it because he'll miss out he told him so much he said listen if they don't want to praise me i'll make the rocks cry and listen listen you know i am he that's the problem is we don't understand how powerful our god is and he is like i am he whether you agree with it or not yes and the bible's so close it's like it's like i'm me you're like lord this day is not going well i need you to break me free from this mess and the lord's like no not today man this jesus thing don't work he's like nope i am he when misery hits your life and things wreck you make you cry and doubt god he still says i am he when you walk away and you go on social media and you talk about dave phoney they don't know nothing they a bunch of hypocrites and all the stuff we love to talk he still sits on his throne and says i am he what he's saying is it doesn't matter your take because your take doesn't impact his greatness he's god and besides him the bible says there is no other and so when we get into understanding he's saving us not for himself but he's saving us for us then we become appreciative of what he is doing in our life recognizing god isn't forcing us to do anything he's allowing us to be a part of his plan you know we come in can i talk a little bit we come in like you know like hey yeah i'm here at church let me how you doing i'm here be blessed that i'm here god says listen i'm trying to let you know i created this space so that you would not be lost we come sasha ain't it i don't know i'll see if i'll be here this week let me see what i feel like and god says listen it's your blessings it's your purpose it's your destiny i'm still he make it this weak or don't i'm still he serve or don't serve i'm still he give or don't give i'm still he attend or don't attend i'm still he god is still god no matter how well you post your pictures to make it look like your life is amazing it's nothing without jesus let me let me tell you how limited we are with satisfaction that that amazing weekend that you put on that storyline is gone in 24 hours all right well keep on moving i want to i want to say this to you today because he's come to save you not just from your sins but to save you from you because we think very highly of ourselves and if we didn't we wouldn't walk out of opinion so much we would walk of purpose my question today is you know to grow you and your discipleship is not for me to make the decision for you but for you to make the decision that you're in need of a savior if you're in need of a savior there is a savior and he will save you and when he saves you there are three things that he wants to do within you as he's saving you jesus did this when he went to the cross point number way point number one is jesus redeemed our past anybody got a past like honest one like i got stuff i ain't got stuff passed you know i ain't got a lot of stuff i just got some stuff but it's not heavy stuff it's not like everybody else's stuff and you know you start fixing it up and then some of us like i gotta pass and let's keep it there it's straight up you can't find it in the records because of god's grace but boy if he pulled that thing out my goodness where would we be here's the thing you only have seen the stuff that you remember there's some past stuff you don't even remember remember july 17th what the heck happened on july 17th jesus like and that's why i'm god we need a savior when we're in need of something we act and operate out of the need for it last week my wife talked about the context of being filled the problem is is that we won't be filled if we don't think we need feeling so the casual relationship with god is your decree to god that i got it i got it when it was rough when you know if he was going to close when when you was on the brink about to give up god was your everything god i thank you you was in worship service crying giving them to you know you you've been so good oh lord thank you as soon as it cleared up see so this week i got to work because when i got to work this week i know i have and god is saying you don't understand i was saving you i was i was changing you i was moving in your life i was directing your path i was opening your mind and your perspective and i was changing you from where you were to where you needed to be and so our minds get so wrapped up in what we think we know and jesus says i'm redeeming your past whatever used to be is no longer what it was because i've came in and made all things new ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 through 5 says this but god somebody say but god man if god was not merciful if he oh if he had you you ah man whoa jeez we think so great of ourselves and our decisions because someone has attached a dollar sign and a diploma to our worth that we've given ourselves exponential amounts of credit on how well we do because of the praises of other people and the bible lets us know but god was merciful it's the only reason you're where you are it's the only reason that you got the job it's the only reason that you did not leave your own body it's his mercy it's not how good you were you couldn't even be committed to what you committed yourself to had he not given you the commitment oh my jesus oh my god do you understand it's nothing but the grace of god that's just the first sentence but god was merciful he was merciful you he was merciful that's why you're where you are he was merciful not because you're so resilient he was merciful not because you're so bright he was merciful not because you had it together he was merciful it says we were dead tell your neighbor quick he was dead he was dead who's that you were dead it says we were dead you think you were living and i'm trying to tell you you were dead past you don't know i used to have a good time in my uh my past was amazing he's like and while you were having a great time you were dead pastor i used to make some crazy money back in the day and i used to sit on top and and he's like and you were dead you were successful in your mind you were dead in your spirit it says we were dead because of our sins he says but god somebody say but god he says but god loved us so much he made us alive with christ and god's gift of undeserved grace what saves you you didn't do it because you're so good i didn't do it because i'm so on point you should have been gone a long time ago your actions your mindset your perspective the way that you thought the anger that lied inside of you the frustrations you lived out of we should have been dead a long time ago y'all know you run your mouth too much so you you you know [Music] it was nothing but the mercies of god it says you were dead now you've been made alive so what do you do with that alive life you live in purpose you live out what he's called you to do you become everything he speaks over your life you don't stay where you are you don't try to live the best life you walk in the best life jesus redeemed our past point number two jesus cover our present his work on the cross covers our present now matthew 6 and 12 says this and forgive us our debts this is not talking about mastercard visa card american express forgive us our sins it says then forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven left remitted let go of the debts and have given up resentment i just want to stop right there anybody holding on to resentment got to let it go forgiveness is bible says you you the way you forgive the way you're forgiven the way you forgive the way you're forgiven i forgave them it's resentment that's why i broke this one out because this one opens it up a little bit more because while you forgave you're still resentful that's why when you came to church you sat over there and they sat over there i love him but i ain't got to like him no oh let's like them too because what we'll do is build a culture of christians who love saying they love people while displaying the unrighteousness of god the bible says let go that resentment look all that hate let let go of that sin it says if you let it go the bible says it has been covered somebody said covered my present has been covered it's it's been covered even when you act a fool it's been covered even when you act in out your the bible says peter got up took the sword out cut off the man ear anybody got any friends like that any of you the friend yep you go back in a couple scriptures he's like upon this rock i'll build my church gates of hell won't prevail that's you peter peter like yeah jesus is like i'm going to go do the will of the father it's like no takes the man's ear off thinking out of himself he's defending god two two things one god doesn't need your defending his word is established whether you believe it or not it's up to you but god doesn't need defending point number two you so wishy-washy he don't need you defending them [Music] [Applause] because you be changing opinions every other day just let the bible do what it does because here's what you got to understand one minute peter found himself passionately after christ and the next minute he was around a campfire denying that he even knew jesus because those are the things that tend to happen that's the real life bus that's the that's the shakiest that's the one i don't know more about this week yet the bible says he still used them here can real quick to church people real quick real fast real quick real quick church people people to go to church real quick those of you others don't worry about it just give me one second with the church people cherish me real quick don't be so consumed with your own righteousness that what you think you're doing is so great and powerful and so upstanding that you cut off the ears of those that god is called to listen because what you'll do [Applause] is cut off the hope of the world because you are still living in brokenness you're still angry resentful haven't found freedom don't know god not discovering your purpose so you're walking with complaints uneasiness brokenness and tiredness because of your lack of submission to the will of the father and some of you are accused of cutting off the ear of the gospel to the world because of your messed up state because you know we don't do that pastor that's not what we believe you don't know what you believe hush up serve jesus i got this why is it so because the idea is that we are not people saviors jesus is so let jesus save that's the job over here to give the word and let jesus save and regardless of where people are now or where they were we're redeemed through jesus christ we're covered in our present and point number three is that jesus has secured our future john chapter 10 verse 27 to he says my sheep hear my voice it says and i know them and they follow me y'all hear all of that commas three things my sheep hear my voice question one are you hearing the voice of the lord number two i know them does god know your name and three they follow me are you following that's a disciple told you i would get you there do you hear the voice of the lord do you find yourself in connection with his spirit through the power of the holy spirit and when he speaks do you follow that's discipleship not sunday not attendance not good posts not worship playlist not just using your gift that's discipleship you want to know what it looks like to follow jesus do you hear him does he know you do you follow that's the question today everything else follows submission follows discipleship the mindset of consumption to contributor follows some of us are saved but not following i want to speak that because we've consumed ourselves with what we think jesus is and how he operates as a savior and what we have to do in order to be in connection with this spirit but the bible says is that we hear him he knows us and we follow [Music] one of my favorite scriptures in 1st corinthians chapter 2 verse 11. and i said often to myself which helps me to toggle between the place of what my soul wants what my body wants but what my spirit desires it says no one comprehends the thoughts of god except the spirit of god it keeps me very grounded and very leveled when i want to exclaim about how much i read the bible when i want to exclaim about how much i pray when i want to exclaim about how great my christian walk is i ask myself this question do i know the mind of god and the way that i know the mind of god is if the holy spirit is actively involved in hearing the voice of god and speaking what his voice says to me it's actually the filter in your christianity now to say is the holy spirit active not just as my salvation active because it's the difference between transformation and the difference between coming out of captivity israel came out of captivity yet they were not transformed you can be saved and still wind up staying the same [Music] he is our savior he is our lord he is our king father in the name of jesus we declare in this place by the spirit of your presence that your will be done on earth as it is in heaven save us our souls our minds but most of all save our spirits so that we are connected with you to the work that you've called us to for we love you we honor you and we thank you in jesus name if you're in this place today and you're saying hey listen i am ready for a fresh start i'm ready for an opportunity to know god to connect with him to know his voice his holy spirit not church by itself but i am ready to make the decision to follow in a way like never before to to flow into this place of surrender unto god that's you today and you're here in person on the count of three i i would love for you to throw your hand up and just make that outward commitment if you're online i would love the opportunity for you to write in the comment section i need jesus and we're just having a moment an encounter with the savior i want to move you beyond church i want to move you into relationship and this relationship can change the very foundation of your life today if that's you on the count of three you know what to do you ready one two three let me see those hands i see you i see you i see you i see you those of you in line we see you i see you i want you to pray this prayer with me and it's not the prayer that changes you it's truly the posture of your heart with god today repeat after me say lord jesus i need you thank you for saving me and changing my life i believe that you are the son of god and that you died on the cross and that you rose again and i pray today that my will would be your will in this earth in jesus name we say amen come on help me celebrate god for those that have made that decision come on big celebration in this place big decisions here's what i'm speaking over your life and here's what i'm believing over the next month of our church and i say to this to those of you that are online that god is doing something new god is doing more than church god is doing transformation god is doing renewing of the mind renewing of the heart and renewing of the soul people that would like freedom god is saying if you're looking for me i am he i am he if you're looking for change i am he if you're looking for healing i am he but it's not going to come out of your doing it's going to come out of your relationship with him by the understanding of the holy spirit i cannot lead you into transformative change without the supernatural power of the holy spirit it has to know the mind of god it has to know what he's saying and it has to be the completion point and you moving from where you were to where god has for you to be today
