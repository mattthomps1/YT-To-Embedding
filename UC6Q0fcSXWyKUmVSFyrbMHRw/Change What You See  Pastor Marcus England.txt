[Music] all right let's get into the word of god matthew chapter nine and we're going to start at verse 27 i sort of want to read a short version of this scripture because there's a lot that happens in matthew chapter 9 but i believe that god wants to speak something well something encouraging something to build our hearts for what is to come this year and we're going to go from verse 27 to verse 31 and it starts and it says and as jesus passed on from there where is there there is galilee as he was moving about in matthew chapter nine healing and uh speaking life into people calling of his disciples it it says that on from there two blind men followed him crying aloud have mercy on us son of david it said when he entered the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them this is something to underline jesus said to them do you believe that i am able to do this do you believe that i am able to do this they said to him yes lord and it says then he touched their eyes saying according to your faith according to your faith be it done to you and their eyes were opened and jesus sternly warned them see that no one knows about it somebody say but but they went away and spread his fame through all that district i want to come from a topic this morning that i want to speak on it is change what you see change what you see let's pray father in the name of jesus we are praying in this moment by the power of your presence your holy spirit that you would allow for us to change the way we are seeing ourselves the way we see you and the way that we see our destiny for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen god bless you thank you so much musicians i am so grateful for every person that is a part of our dream team our volunteer staff here and i just want to celebrate all of those that are part of making today happen can you help me celebrate our dream team in the house come on help me celebrate somebody else help us be encouraging to other people i'm grateful i'm grateful i'm grateful that we have a church of contributors and not just a church of consumers we have people that understand the vision of our church is to move people from their past to passion and purpose a full life in jesus christ matthew chapter nine i i love matthew chapter nine if you've ever read it before it is packed with miracles it is packed with god moving and doing it seems like jesus is unable to stay still in matthew chapter nine we find out that as he comes into his hometown which is known to be nazareth or galilee it says he's moving about in galilee the first thing when he gets from crossing over in his vote it says that jesus encounters a paralytic someone who is unable to walk those that are his friends or his associates bring him to jesus and the bible says is that jesus heals him on the spot he tells him your sins are forgiven take up your mat and walk jesus though is not finished yet and jesus making this man well and whole the bible says that he passes by matthew at the tax collector's booth the man who is undeserving of jesus even speaking to him a man who in jewish culture is seen as a betrayer a man and whom people don't even want to talk to a man who has done so much things that the bible says that people discard him and push him to the side jesus does something unthinkable he heals the paralytic and forgives them of their sins and it starts up our uproar between the pharisees and the religious leaders he comes to matthew and then he calls a tax collector jesus is on his own moment i'm trying to tell you he's in a space he's in a moment he's in a time where he is ready and the bible says he calls them and pulls them in and now jesus goes to the place where he's eating with tax collectors and sinners can i tell somebody in here that jesus was with you before you were saved can i tell somebody online that god was watching out for you even in your lowest and your dirtiest and your most worst moments can i tell you he was already there preparing a way for you to get connected to him jesus didn't just pop on the scene when you got saved he was already making elena and making a way for you to get to him the bible says don't think it being great of yourself that you came to jesus but he first drew you well you have a testimony you tell people i came to the lord no no no you have to say eventually when i let my pride go eventually when i let my preferences go and eventually that i found out i was a sinner did you find out that you were a person that was broken and messed up that's when your heart opened and jesus pulled you in to save your soul that's what that moment is about the bible lets us know that he goes from there and and he has to speak to some others about what it is to fast and he says the disciples don't need to fast when the son of man is with him but there will be a time where they need to fast then jesus in his pursuit still moves forward and finds himself going to a 12 year old girl's funeral the bible says that a religious a leader not a religious but a leader comes to him and says my daughter is dead will you come and touch her the bible lets us know on his way jesus is is is is uh interrupted by a woman with an issue of blood for 12 years as he's on his way to a 12 year old girl jesus just passing by heals her on his way to wake up a young girl who is not dead but asleep the bible is letting us know jesus is on a mission can i tell you that even through these last two years that jesus is on a mission can i tell you that even in the middle of circumstances that seem overwhelming and life's place where it seems that we've gone from issues of health and we've gone from issues of social injustice and we've gone from issues of self-preservation that god is still working on the throne and i want to let you know it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter where you're in i'm telling you jesus is walking around seeking whom he can bless seeking coma he can heal seeking whom he can deliver my question to you today is do you believe that god can change your circumstances the bible lets us know that jesus is on tour y'all he's on tour in his hometown and when he gets to a certain place where he has just raised a 12 year old girl from the dead the bible says that there are two blind men who are chasing after him yelling to him jesus thou son of david have mercy on us now here's where i've got to break the story for you because the only way in which they knew that jesus was near is that someone had to be able to tell them that the lord was passing through now in order for them to even care that jesus was passing through must have meant that there was something that they knew about what jesus had just done jesus being on tour they saw the highlight reels they heard what he had done with the woman with the issue of blood they they heard that he was taking people one by one and healing them they they heard that he was raising the dead they heard that jesus was passing through and there's something just enough to hear that god is passing through to make an assertion to say if he'll do it for someone else he'll do it for me and i'm here today to let you know that god is here to do it for you it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter what life has brought you god is here to do it for you today don't you count yourself out don't you put yourself in the place where you say god won't walk past god won't heal me god won't deliver me i'm here today to let you know that if you could cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me you can get the attention of god my question today is in 2022 are you willing to get god's attention for your healing for your deliverance for your change if you are can somebody say thank god in this place i'm believing because right now as you're thinking god god is moving and he's doing as you're thanking him right now he's changing your circumstances as he's as you're thanking god right now he's doing more than you could even imagine or even think and i believe today that god is calling for us to see something greater the bible says that these men pleaded for mercy and as jesus entered into the house he said to them do you really believe do you really believe that i am able to do this and can i tell you that their answer determined the next movement of what jesus would do i want to put that to you very clearly because some of you have asked jesus to move on your behalf but the issue is is that in your asking you didn't believe you ever asked somebody to do something that you thought they would never do anybody ever been in that place where you asked somebody hey listen can i have a hundred dollars they pulled out he was like oh no i was just i was just kidding the problem is is that you had a broken expectation level of what could be done for you the bible lets us know that they had not seen jesus heal but they had only heard that jesus healed and in their hearing it convinced their spirit enough that their condition was so broken that if there was a chance that jesus could change it all around then they would ask him to do the very thing jesus response was do you believe that i am able to do this and their response to him was yes yes i believe it lord yes i believe you are the one who can do it and this is where i want to get you at is because there's something that you're asking god right now in your life there is something that you're believing god that keep can do there it's something that you're believing god can change there is something that you've been stuck with for a long time that god is saying i'm ready to move but the question is do you believe that he is able do you believe he's able and the question comes as a faith question the bible lets us know that we must have faith in order to please god well pastor today you may say well what is faith let's look at it at hebrews 11 and 1 and i'm going to read it in this uh a passion translation and it says that now faith brings our hopes into reality and becomes the foundation needed to acquire the things we long for it is also the evidence required to prove what is still somebody say unseen yeah it's not about what you see so the the blind men these two blind men had an advantage their advantage was that they only heard they did not see an issue that we deal with today for those of us that are able to see is that we are more reliant on the sense of seeing than we are on the sense of hearing or knowing and because we have to see everything it requires us to prove so much in order for us to be convinced that god can be able to do what he says he can do now i want to help you today to realize is that you are doing a disservice to yourself when you don't understand that you have got to be able to believe for that in which you have not seen the reason why you're praying is because something hasn't manifested in your life that you want to see the idea is that prayer is a part of the movement of your faith to ask god for things that you have on your heart that only he can do that's the context of why we are going after faith it's the reason that we are jumping after a space of god can you do here is why your prayer life may lag a little bit is because your belief is not matching up with your actions and your belief in actions put you in a broken place because the bible says that it's of faith james 2 and 26 without works is dead now if you're not praying you're not praying because you possibly believe that you have disqualified yourself forgot to be able to move today i just want to let you know just like someone will tell you when you get a car or someone will tell you when you get a home you are qualified to be able to receive from god what he has for you today it is the enemy's job to make you believe that you disqualify because of your past or even your current state of where you are but i am here to let you know that the word of god says not according to your credit report not according to how perfect your record is not according to what you did last night but according to the grace of god you qualify for god to do a miracle in your life i want you to speak this to yourself you need to wake up every morning and say i'm qualified the reason that you're not getting up to pray it's because you believe that you're not qualified for god to do something you believe god is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa i don't do that for people like you god is saying oh i'm just waiting for people like you to trust me and to believe in me and to believe that i can do anything that you ask in my name question is do you believe i want to pause and i want to challenge you with this thought that that question am i able to do is always on the table for you to answer it's always on the table for you to inquire of the reason why you choose not to pray about it is because you're answering the question am i able to do this and you're saying jesus either you're not able to do it or you're not able to do it for me and you're disqualifying your own blessings and the movement of your purpose and your destiny the enemy is very good at what he does which is the idea to set you up so well that you think that the manner in which you have lived or you are living disqualifies you from the love of god if the love of god disqualifies you then it's no need to ask our father for anything because he's not going to hear me because he only hears people that do good and god is saying in order for you to know truly who i am you must understand what my word says and john 3 16 lets us know that god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son he wouldn't have gave his son if he thought that you were going to live out life perfectly he would have kept his son and never made such a sacrifice but what you must understand is that over two thousand years ago he knew you and i would not be able to keep up with everything that we wanted to do and tried to do but he said my what my grace my blood my mercy will cover you so stop disqualifying yourself because of where you find yourself to be or where you used to be god says my blood has covered it all if you live out of conviction then you can't believe in the cross because the cross denies the ability to live out of i'm sorry out of condemnation and if condemnation is where you live out of you don't believe that the cross has the ability to do the work that it does so when you stay in the place of i'm disqualified what you're saying is the cross's blood does not work enough for me and i'm here today to let you know is that the blood of jesus covers somebody say all all sins i don't care what you've done i don't care who you've done it with i don't care where you did it i don't care the way in which you did it the blood of jesus covers all sins once i believe that god covers all sins then i believe that i'm invited into the family of god as i believe i'm invited into the family of god i believe i have the privileges as a child of god when i believe i have the privileges as a child of god then what i understand and clarity is that as a child of god that means god has blessings that are specifically for me not because i've seen it but because i've heard that he has something for me i've read he has something for me this is what these two blind men they heard that jesus was passing by can we go back real quick and and look at matthew chapter 9 and i just want to look at one verse in a different version verse 29 and it says this then jesus put his hands over their eyes and said you will have what your faith expects you will have what your faith expects some of us are mad because we went to god in prayer but our faith didn't align up with our request and god's word is saying your faith is producing your expectation your faith is producing your expectation what you are seeing is a result of what you are believing i want to let you know that that's a easy place for us to kind of summarize everything that we need to be able to summarize so we can stop blaming god for what we lack and start blaming our faith of not believing that he can do whether it is we don't believe he has the power or we don't believe that we are worthy it is our level of faith that has broken our expectations i want to share with you the word that god gave me over a month ago as i was sitting and just listening and i'm saying god i i really have never come and just been like our church has a word today our church has a word for the year and and i wasn't even looking for it but i was in a moment with god in in his presence and the lord said tell the mix this is the word for the year expect he said this is the word that i want you to speak over them is to expect to have an expectation level that i'm going to do what i said i would do according to their faith i'm speaking that in someone's life today because the bible is not a lie because it's god's word and he is saying today if you put yourself in faith position i will do what i said i will do according to your level of faith the way you sow will be the way in which you reap the way in which you pray will be the way in which you hear god and see him move through your life the way in which you love will be the way in which you receive the overwhelming love of god i'm here today to let you know according to the level of your faith it will be given unto you according to the level of your belief it will be given on to you so what i wanted to do is help you to get to where you need to be so i need you to understand that god wants to do the impossible in your life how will god do the impossible i've got one point for today y'all and that point is change your expectation of god change your expectation of god change your idea of what god wants to do for you in you and through you three things god wants to do something for you through you and in you most of the time we limit ourselves to god only doing something for us but god is not here just to bless us for ourselves he's here to bless us and he's also here to bless us so that we can be a blessing god wants to bless us he wants to work through us and then he wants to change us by working in us our point for the day is change your expectation of god how how do i change my expectation of god the first thing that you must do is know the character of god you've got to know the character of god if you don't know about somebody how do you know what to even do with them if you don't know how somebody is how do you know how to have a level of expectation of what they will do if you don't know about people how do you know what they will or they won't do so we've got to check out god's character the first character that i want you to understand is that god is omniscient god is omniscient which means that god is all knowing whatever it is that you have done will do or choose to do god already knows however it is that you feel whatever your insecurities are whatever it is that you're thinking in your mind that you're saying is too big for god i want to let you know he already knows he knows your past he knows your present and he knows your future he knows what you did last night he knows what you're going to do tonight he knows the state of where your mind is god is all-knowing so stop hiding from him if you could just be comfortable and be like god this is who i am this is where i am this is what's going on with me i gotta release it somewhere the problem is is that we're not releasing and we're taking things with us and building our own sense of emotions that bring blockage for god to speak and to move in our life god is saying the best therapy you could ever have is in the morning with me how about you let me know everything that's god i woke up this morning and i'm just disturbed i don't know why i feel like a failure i feel like things are going back to where they used to be i need your help god's saying i know it all already and i've set up a path for you to already walk in so that you can meet the individual that was going to turn your heart around so that you could walk into the place that was going to change your mindset i've got it all together i just need you to recognize that i'm all-knowing [Music] if you knew god already knew then you would tell them the reason why we we keep things from god or we lie is because we believe that we're hiding something from god that he does not already know if somebody already know you did something then the best thing to do is to walk up to him be like i know you know so let's talk about it i know you know so let's get this thing out on the table i know you know so we might as well talk about this right now because the worst thing that god feels is that you can't trust him enough to be able to handle your deepest and darkest secrets and moments and god is saying i want to get you to the place where you can trust me with everything that is on your heart that you can be able to explain to me your ups and your downs your breaking moments and your celebratory moments i want you to be able to know i already know so won't you just share it with me god already knows the second characteristic of god that is he is omnipotent it means he's all-powerful all power lies in his hands god is in control of all things god is not out of control when it looks like the world is out of control don't you base god's ability to be in all power based on the inability of man to be out of power i want to give you clarity where you see people falling and messing up and losing confidence and dropping off i want to let you go know that god does not change the bible says he is the same yesterday today and forever more so because he's all-powerful means he can do all things the question is do you believe that god has the ability to do exceeding and abundantly above all that you could even ask or the bible says even think. if he's all-powerful what is it that god can't do should be your question if i walked in prayer with like all right let's talk about what you can't do god's like well i'm i'm omnipotent i i don't this is not gonna be a long conversation i can do i can do anything somebody say anything god says i can i can do anything you're like god but you don't know the state no you don't understand what the definition of anything is whatever you're thinking i can do i form the earth what is it that i cannot do i'm all powerful i am all-knowing and the third characteristic that we must know about god is that he is omnipresent that means he is everywhere at the same time god is not walking away from you in this moment saying my god i didn't see it i'm sorry about that i missed that one god is saying if something isn't go going according to the way that you want it to go it means that i purposefully put this in position so that it wouldn't take place because i know what's happening on the other side bible says in all things give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you some of us are getting frustrated with life because we're not seeing the result of what we want to see immediately here's the problem there are things that your flat tire kept you from being in an accident and instead of giving god thanks for just being god you got mad at the rest of your day but you did not see the 18 wheeler that lost control three miles up the road that could have been you you must learn in all things i'm giving god thanks why because he knows all he sees all he is all-powerful so he's operating on my behalf you must understand the character of god my god is powerful my god is all-knowing my god is everywhere at the same time and i'm here today to let you know is that god is in full control of what is happening in this moment you've got to know the character of god you number two you've got to know the history of god god's got a a history to him god's got this this this idea of of of of of he's been doing this for a while can i can i tell you that you're special but your circumstances aren't can i tell you you're amazing but what you're going through god has said i've i've done greater i've handled more you you're tripping out because your computer crashing god says you know i've stopped wars do you understand i've held the sun in place and you're tripping off of the small stuff the bible lets us know that god has a history can i tell you even in marketing today they will tell you that one of the absolute best ways and which to market is still through word of mouth it's still through the referral program it's still through telling somebody how good your experience was can i tell you that there's something amazing that jesus spoke to 12 disciples the disciples that he traveled with in this moment and the bible says with those 12 he spoke into them to go and give this word to anyone and everyone you see and 2 000 years later we're standing right where we are because of the history of who god is this word does not fail bible lets us know that god has a story he he he has a place that he's coming from that you don't understand there are things that he's changing and things he's allowing to happen that you don't understand for the bible lets us know that we we don't understand god's thoughts his his ways are higher than his our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts god's doing things and he's up to something even when you think he's forgotten about you god has history can can i tell you i could probably take a mic right now and pass it to multiple people and just say share one thing that god has done with you and you will hear testimony beyond testimony of the goodness and greatness of what god do i have anybody here that has a testimony do i have anybody here that knows what god has done for them it's god has a history you know i grew up in church where i was constantly seeing the miraculous of what god would do i never forget being a young man being in in kids church and after service we they would bring us up and they and they sat set us on the back pew we had a pew y'all it wasn't chairs it was a pew one long chair for a long time i sat on that pier i remember i was i was like right here and i remember in this area there were seats and and i remember my grandmother was preaching and i'll never forget that we came up and as she was delivering the word of god one of our deacons passed away died in the middle of our service never forget it why because so much of the church stood up and she stopped preaching the message i'll never forget what happened it's the history of knowing what god can do it's a history of knowing who god is and how faithful it i'll never forget she she walked from the podium and she walked over and and and and the musicians be just begin to to play it and i began to remember the people of god begin to stand up and there begin to be pray and she said this one thing people have got prey and she went over and laid hands and his name was deacon lovelace hardy and she placed her hands on him and she said in the name of jesus i rebuke death i will never forget this man came back to life from the back seat as a child i'll never forget seeing that moment i had to look to the side and somebody said he died he died he died he died he lost all function of his body he died and he was raised back to life it's a history here's why history is important because within with no history you'll go to your own history and your own history will be about you working it out and not god oftentimes people can get jealous of your faith because you've seen things and believe things that don't seem to line up with what they know the problem is is that i'm willing to trust god at different levels because i know of his history and his track record when we put ourselves in position that we don't build a relationship with god we don't give god the opportunity to do the supernatural in our life so when the supernatural is not performed in our life we don't have a history or a place to go to to say i'm willing to trust god out of the normal of what i know because i've seen him do it before the thing about 21 days of prayer and fasting is that you need a history with god and you need god to do something in the 21 days that will give you a history of who he is so that when times get hard and when you believe all is lost you have a history of your own of what god can do if you only believe in the past of what you put together you will never trust god enough to pray beyond what you could even do of yourself to know that god will do exceeding abundantly above all that you could ask or think that's why prayer isn't important to you because you have no history for god to be able to rely on what he's done so you're only relying on what you believe enough instead of allowing his history to activate the faith inside of you that's why it's hard for christians who are saved but don't have relationship to see the activated power of jesus christ because while you are saved there's no supernatural happening in your life from you to move from faith to faith so no faith to faith means you have to rely on your thinking and your emotions to carry you through your salvation that's why so many fall off in the faith is because they don't have a supernatural history with god to do the impossible why are you willing to trust him because i've seen him do the supernatural why isn't church boring to me because i know how great god is to be able to be a part of a relationship with god that in the matter of speaking to him in a moment that he can change my very set of circumstances puts me in the place where god's word never becomes dull to me i can never sleep in church let me tell you why because i'm waiting on god to speak to me so that he can give me a revelation of where i am to go next unspiritual people the bible says will never understand this because you don't have a spiritual encounter you're trying to logically understand how god can move in your life but it doesn't make sense so you try to act the part out through your own goodness but your goodness is not good enough so you have no history so that's why your relationship with god is very brittle and very sensitive because it lacks the supernatural foundation for you to get over where you are that's why if you look at yourself you can choose church or choose not because you don't have an expectation supernaturally that god is going to move speak or change so it becomes recreational according to your liking not according to your need i don't always preach out of liking i preach out of need because supernaturally i need god to change my circumstances so church is no longer about do i want to or don't i church is about me understanding that god is doing a work on the inside for me through me and in me because in my growing relationship i need accountability because my human emotions take over so i need to be in community with people who can lead me in the direction of where i should go that's why we push you get into a mixed group when february comes why because you need to be in community with people so you don't quit your journey because you believe god is not able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think the enemy wants you to quit so you have no history to fall back on no history gives you no reason to stay no reason to stay put you right back where you used to be you're thinking it's all about congregating on a sunday and it isn't it's about your spiritual development that puts you in position to hear from god that puts a man in position to lead his home that puts a woman in position to be able to follow as god has called for her to follow and to develop her own life as she's called and to know her purpose outside of his purpose these things don't happen without spiritual growth spiritual growth does not happen by just attending it's about changing your view it's about changing what you see and the last thing in order to find yourself in the place where you don't go back and you don't live out what you used to be the last point is that you must know the word of god god's word is life-changing and it's powerful [Music] i don't want to hear in our church christians saying things like you know i don't know that stuff we're not celebrating a lack of knowing god's word a lack of reading a lack of being in tune to the presence of god i'm i want to tell you this because i rather you not waste your sunday time believing that your attendance is going to develop your growth it is about the development of your relationship with god it's the only thing that i can offer you that is for sure you can go to 90 different churches trying to find your preference but if you don't find your relationship you're never going to find your growth and if you don't find your growth you're never going to understand your destiny and if you don't understand your destiny then you will sit where you are saying this is the end to life life has more life has greater it's more expectation that you have the ability to be able to believe in today i i want to let you know if if your mantra in life has been whatever can go wrong will go wrong and your perspective is off if your mantra in life is i'll make it work if your mantra in life is i'll figure it out you you're missing god at the center you need to get back to the place where you're understanding that your cry out for god it's everything that he wants to hear from you jesus thou son of david have mercy on us for the next 21 days of prayer and fasting january the 9th through the 29th i want to explain to those of you that are new that's a time for us to focus in on god at the top of the year the time of prayer is to seek after god so that he can do something for us something through us and something in us our time of fasting is declaring to god i'm serious about what i'm doing i'm serious about the direction that i'm taking and this prayer time that we're having will be the very thing that changed you mark 1 35 says this early in the morning while it was still dark jesus got up slipped out to a solitary place to pray why do i believe morning prayer is important because i believe you need daily direction [Music] i believe in praying whenever you want but i specifically believe as a pastor in mourning prayer because i believe you need direction from god daily and i won't push that to the side for conversation with god for convenience we are trying to make our growth as easy as possible and it does not come without a sacrifice but on the other side of that sacrifice is joy unspeakable it's faith beyond to see what god could do outside of the ordinary it is a life of destiny and purpose it is seeing god use you to change the world god has given every person in this room gifting some of you are called in just to speak life i've done it myself walk into a person and somebody's talking about an illness and i've laid hands on them and watched them heal some of you are called to speak out of the prophetic of what god's called you to do some of you are called to be activated in your spiritual gifts but you are just settling for a distant christianity and i'm here today to speak to say the god once more if you want more [Music] i'm not here to push you to church church becomes your reasonable service when you have the joy of the lord in your heart but today i want to push you into relationship with jesus christ can we pray today father in the name of jesus we are declaring in this place that your will be done in our lives god we need you to change the way we see change the the way we view change the way that we come into clarity and understanding father i'm praying for every individual watching and every individual that is in this place lord that you would change the way we see this new year maybe we were walking in with doubt and maybe we were walking in with issues from the last year but god i am declaring today that we are changing what we see we are walking by faith and having the expectancy that you will do what you said you will do for we love you we honor and we praise you
