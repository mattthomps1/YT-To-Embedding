foreign let's get into the word of God week two of how do I know how do I know we're going to talk about a new season today we're going to talk about we talked about our stay season what does it look like when we're single and we're not ready to move forward but we're going to talk something different today and I want to talk this um and read this scripture in Ruth chapter three we're going to talk about Boaz because Boaz is for those of you that know is the Hot Topic for single women that they want a Boaz they don't even know who he is or how to spell his name but we go we're going we're going to jump into this a little bit can we read starting at verse one it says that Naomi her mother-in-law said to her my daughter should I not seek rest for you that it may be well with you why why isn't it well with Naomi's daughter like what what's going on what's Happening well when we get an understanding is that Ruth has found herself in place where her husband has died and she is spending her days serving her mother-in-law she gets back to the nation and I don't know if you can understand in life sometimes we just feel a sense or lack of value and who we are because of life's circumstances and she begins to connect her because she's playing Matchmaker I don't know if y'all know about that but she's playing Matchmaker let me hook you up so you can have some rest that's what she said let me let me match make you let me put you in an uh a marriage that can connect you let me help you make some connection she says it's not Boaz our relative with those whose young women you were see he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor so she a little bit stalkerish understood boaz's schedule and Naomi is able to get to her this clarity she says wash therefore and anoint yourself and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor but do not make yourself known to the man she says have some self-control just cause you're single don't mean you you don't need to have some self have some self-control keep it chill all right she says wash therefore and anoint yourself put on your cloak go down to the threshing foam don't make yourself known to the man until he's finished eating and drinking women Point number one don't interrupt your man while he's eating all right but when he lies down observe the place where he lies then go and uncover his feet and lie down and he will tell you what to do and she replied all that you say I will do so she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of grain then she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid out at midnight the man was startled because she low cray-cray and turn over and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who are you now this is not Karen so don't do this in real life if you find a man that you like brothers you find a woman that you like do not go and lay at her feet right now you can be arrested he said who are you and she answered I am Ruth your servant spread your wings over your sermon for you are a redeemer and he said may you be blessed by the Lord I could I could pull that out I'll tell you ladies if you do not have a man that can bless you speak ovary you have made this last kindness greater than the first and that you have not gone after young men you ain't been everywhere you ain't out there but you're waiting patiently forgot to do for the poor Rich it says this and now my daughter do not fear I will do for you all that you ask for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a Worthy woman [Music] I want to come from the topic today Choose Wisely tell your neighbor real quick Choose Wisely my God tell your second neighbor because they didn't get it Choose Wisely look at your third choice and tell them listen to me choose why he's sleep and then look at them real quick and say I'm serious [Applause] [Music] Choose Wisely let's pray father we thank you for this moment we thank you for this opportunity that you have helped us to Choose Wisely and all things that concern you for we love you Anna and thank you in Jesus name somebody say amen amen God bless you thank you so much musicians the best band in the world can y'all help me give it up for our Dream Team in this place y'all so so today my hope is that if you are single that you would look uh to your singleness um and then look at your unmarried status and make a decision if Pursuit is important for you and I want to let you know that if you're in a relationship not a marriage in a relationship and you know and you see the signs and you're looking and you're saying to yourself I'm not in the place that I believe I should be I pray that this would provoke you to change somebody say change one of the hardest things to do is change when you're in too deep anybody ever know that before you've made a decision you've gotten in you haven't sealed it but you are there and something in you is telling you this is not the best way to go there's something about what you understand it's a Clarity in what people see you you here's how you know when you are situation don't really want to be in but you feel like you're too deep you don't ask anyone else about the situation because you don't want to hear the truth you keep it away you keep it to the side you make sure it's not something you dive into because you think and you may understand that you are not choosing wisely one of my favorite movies that that I like is Indiana Jones in the Last Crusade I don't know if anybody has ever seen that before but I like it because it's biblical at least that's what I tell myself they are going after the cup of the lord they're going after the cup that that Jesus used at the Last Supper and and as they're going after that cup uh Indy gets into a place where where Indiana Jones is an architect and he's a guy that loves missions and so he gets into the place where he is going after it and there is a group of people that are forcing him to go after this cup now he and another gentleman and a young lady they all get to the final stages after they get through a horror and as they get through faith walks and they go through it you gotta go watch this great movie but the idea is that they are called there is a cup a table of cups and on that table are so many cups that could possibly be the cup of the Lord if you choose the wrong cup it will end in death but if you choose the right one it can heal you and give you an eternity of life it is something special because when you look at the cups how can you really determine if it's the best cup that's the decision and the question that many of us are asking for those relationships that we're in the relationships that we're holding on to the relationships that we text at ten o'clock at night all of those relationships we're asking how do I know when they when they go in there is a a man who is supposed to be protecting to make sure that no one steals it and so he tells them this one phrase Choose Wisely the man who is the doctor not Indiana Jones but the other man he comes and he looks and he goes in and he begins to look at all of the cups and and there's different kinds of Cups large cups big cups tall cups shortcuts and he goes and looks and he picks up a cup and he says this has gotta be the cup and why does he say that he says because the cup of Our Lord has to be fancy it's got jewelry on it it's a Gold Cup it it has rubies in it and it has all these pieces and he says this has got to be the cup of the Lord why he says because the God our King Our Savior would only drink out of this kind of cup because he thought our Lord would do something based on the way it looked he chooses the cup and when he dips the cup into the water and the fountain he drinks it and he says this is it the problem is is that he did not Choose Wisely when he chooses it he begins to immediately die and to do what he begins to actually disappear into dust Indiana comes and he looks and he says our God our Lord Our Savior was a carpenter he says he's a carpenter he he wasn't interested in all the fangmen all the bling and all the fashion he was he wasn't interested in that he says you know what this is the company picks up a cup and the cup is normal the cup is very very average the cup looks like something that nobody would shrink out of but he says this is the cup of a carpenter and he dips the water in and he drinks it and the guard says you have chosen wisely Pastor why would you tell us that story because it's important for you to understand that your choice and who you build a relationship can extend your life or end it very quickly [Applause] and some of us are caught in an idea that if I choose according to the way it looks I'll get what I want and I'll get what I need we talked about the list last week y'all y'all remember the list y'all you talked about how requirements you talked about what they look like I like beard no beard uh you know gentlemen I like tall tall I I like dark skin I like light skin you know how we do we go through now here's something I want to say you should be attracted to your mate but the problem is is when you rest everything on how it looks you will miss the very understanding that what it looks like is not what it is it can look cute it can be sharp it can dress that thing right there I'm telling you elegant speak I want to let you know degrees up the watsu but the problem is when you actually taste it when you get into relationship with it when you get connected with it when you find out it has no Foundation when you find out it has no substance when that thing looked good on the outside but it was messed up on the inside it could kill you [Applause] and that's how the world is teaching us to choose choose because you think you know what it looks like on the outside and we find ourselves not choosing wisely because we think we know because somebody told us we are the answer I can't can I can I get real with us today I I want to put you in a space because here's the idea the second season that God is calling us to is the pursuit season the pursuit season means you change your mind from the single season to a place where you're willing to begin to understand there's less of me and more of what God wants for me to do what someone I connect with now here's what I want to tell you is that if you get into a relationship with the understanding idea that you are the main focal point that you are going to stay doing the way things the ways that you've decided to do you're going to find yourself that as the Bible tells us in Genesis that we're called to become one you will never become one with someone when you can only see yourself as the most important person in the relationship I want to tell you this because oftentimes we connect with people who we love the bravado of what they bring across but the problem is is we don't understand that they don't have an open heart to be able to hear and understand and to be able to reciprocate what we need because reciprocating is important to understanding that love is a part of what I give and what I get when you understand your love is a part of what you're giving and getting when you find someone who knows how to get but does not know how to give then you will find yourself empty and dry with no one being able to replenish you back to the place that they called you to the problem is we choose according to what makes us feel good in the moment and set up what has longevity and what we see and so we ignore red flags because we're lonely anybody have been lonely before amen amen that's right you declare that thing in the world yes I have Jesus and I need you to solve it [Applause] when you find yourself lonely loneliness is not always the byproduct of being single loneliness is the byproduct of not being at a place where you are receiving what you need all right so why do people tend to like the idea of singleness now instead of the idea being with someone else because it is hard to find someone else on the same page that you are living life out with and the reason that you find yourself saying I'll state where I am because you're in something that's taking more from you than what you're receiving you're always calling asking for something very little do you have to give and when you find yourself in the place you got to ask yourself is this is is is this what I want because giving means that there's a possibility that I will be left empty if the person cannot return what it is that I need you should be getting someone else that's thinking the same thing so that as you share together you recognize that you're doing too much for me and I'm doing too much for you this is what I needed the Bible lets us know that Naomi is speaking to Ruth and she's telling Ruth let me set you up let me get you connected let me help you find rest she says to her let me teach you what rest looks like let me point you in the direction of where you need to go now some of us I'm just going to ask if you know if you're in this place and you're single anybody look at your past relationships and know that you don't always make the best decisions can you be honest you look at it and you say I'm not sure anybody ever been to that point where there were pictures and you are hiding those pictures as not for people to see what your ex look like so they don't say were you good [Applause] here's the thing all of us are somebody else's exes that was you [Applause] laughs y'all made my wifey should be going through old pictures I was like for real wow that's right you almost ended up yeah got really watched out for you [Applause] because the idea is all of us know what to do we know who to pick we know how to pick we know what it should look like what we want but the problem is it's so many often times we're looking for what it looks like instead of what it really is oh it's cool it's dressed unique is different you know you different than everybody else no you're not let me go on my Instagram page I can find somebody look just like you here you go and you're trying to look for Unique when you need to be looking for Godly oh the first point I want to give you is that your call to choose with understanding somebody say understanding not with just feelings feelings are important because if you don't feel it it ain't good you have to have a connection somebody say you got to have a connection is important so let's not get spiritual and be like I don't need it doesn't matter how they look um yeah no no no no no no no no I need to turn around [Applause] and not scream oh hey hey hey you good it's good to see you I didn't I didn't know who you were so you got to be attracted attraction is important you have to be that let's listen I don't care what nobody attraction is important to the process of it but it cannot be the only thing cannot be the only thing that you focus on you have to choose with understanding somebody say understanding you gotta choose with understanding because if you don't choose with understanding what you do is you choose out of your desperate place that's why your singleness your season of stay is so important for you to develop because you find out who you are as an individual and as you find out who you are as an individual when you go to look and to pursue you're not only going for what you see you're also going for what you need God I need something greater than what I had because if you had it you would have stayed with it properly but when you don't know who you are and what you need you go after anything that gives you attention you cute Emma Emma Emma like how cute like what do you because most of us don't think ourselves to be as actually other people see us so we let up here here's how I'm gonna tell you I will walk up to anybody and be like in our lobby and be like oh my God you look amazing today no I don't okay all right we we should talk about that because I don't want to convince you of something that you don't even believe yourself if you don't believe it yourself then you're waiting for someone to come along to tell you and that person you'll lock into because they have the words that you need to feel who God already says you are you would stop running to compliments and you would say thank you I know bruh come on you I'm TR fellas I'm trying to help you right now I'm I'm trying to step up your confidence game by 10. hey I just want to let you know you look good oh thank you I know and just see just keep right see I'm trying to teach y'all I'm trying to give you gain here's the reason why because everyone around us is looking for security and security comes through confidence and so you're trying to figure out fellas why she keep going what to do that's on the street that you like he ain't got nothing I got everything the reason is is she feels confident in him it has nothing to do with money it has nothing to do with how much they got it has nothing to do with gay I when I thought about this I said oh my goodness why do why do women keep getting with individuals and men with women who you don't you you know you're looking at them like what hmm real quick how many times you've been to jail seven I got it I got it I got it you're gonna protect me I get it I get it [Applause] nobody nobody won't be honest all right I'm good I'm good no no they choosing has so much to do with security that's why you will compromise your faith because you will trust in the security of what someone else brings rather in the God and who created you [Applause] can I give you a scripture real quick if is this real quick I'm trying to give you some understanding in second Corinthians chapter six verse 14 it says this do not be unequally yoked with if you have a Bible underline it unbelievers for what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness or what Fellowship has light with Darkness so here's what we do we take this scripture and we say all right so the safety ground with with me marrying The Only Way Pastor is going to marry me is if they believe in Jesus so you go find somebody and be like you go to church Easter all right cool cool high five let's do this let's do this [Music] some of y'all not laugh yellow that's what that's what I did and I don't think that's funny he he'll believe her but he don't like really believe in Jesus excuse me here here's where I want to help you the Bible does not say don't be yoked with non-christians it says unbelievers so the question is to determine an unbeliever do you know what you believe and when you ask them do they believe the same thing that's unbelievers we don't have the same foundational belief we don't see God the same we don't believe relationship with God is important because now you take the unbeliever put them into a position now you say let's go serve God together and your foundation is jacked up because they weren't a believer you're trying to make unbelievers believe what you believe and do what you do and it never sustains because they never believed in the beginning I believe Jesus is something but I'm not going to do anything to pursue the faith let me go and hit you real quick with Genesis the Bible lets us know that man was created out of dust as Man was created out of dust it gives us Clarity that man is the only individual created out of dust it says now next woman is created out of the rib after that the children are created out of the Union of man and woman here's the clarity nobody thinks about the Dust and how important it is to make sure that it's good soil [Music] is it good soil because what God is going to build your family on is the foundation of what the dust is shaky dust shaky family [Applause] no no number two that's what y'all want number two because the idea is that when God builds he builds Upon A firm foundation here's the thing about foundations you ever went and looked at a house nobody thinks the foundation is amazing you go and be like yo I'm building a new house let's go look at it and you pull up and there's nothing but a foundation and everybody looking at you like what is this if you understood how to build you will understand this is the most important part if this crumbles everything crumbles so when you have a broken Foundation who does not know God who is not filled with his Holy Spirit who is an unbeliever to the things that you believe who does not understand the understanding of family or has the desire to learn and grow in it what you have is a image of security and an image of a foundation but it will crack so you must choose with understanding when you don't understand the only other option you have to choose out of is your feelings and your sight but if you understood you would Choose Wisely somebody say Choose Wisely so important because the Bible lets us know you get with the wrong person and it will wear you because you're always trying see can I tell you real quick my wife is here so it's in front of her for y'all those that y'all go tell on me when when she's not in here and then mixed kids we are opposites absolutely opposites I'm not going to tell you on what because it would be from my perspective and I would make it feel very judgmental I would skew it in my favor [Applause] [Music] but we are opposites with the same belief does that make sense you're trying to get connected with people who don't believe what you will believe so because we're so selfish someone's responsibility is to sway you to their side because I desire Comfort I'm going to ask you to do what I do and to believe what I believe and to go the way I go and to see it the way I see it so it's not about marrying somebody who's like you it's about connecting with someone who has your beliefs let me let me help you you get into a relationship and you don't come out of a house where everybody's cussing and you get with somebody whose mouth is just as far as they ever could be guess what where's the tension going to start because what I don't believe in what it's not about is it a sin or isn't it it's about we don't even have the same somebody say the same beliefs so now my understanding is is that I've got to compromise my standards that I created in my stay stage you know what I'm saying bring in my state season that I said this is who I am and I get with someone who compromises who I am so that I can become what they want me to be instead of Us coming together now we're fighting because you never believed oh oh real quick can I can I oh I want to skip y'all I want to skip why can't I tell you this here's another indicator of it Point number two choose with community the Bible said Ruth was like whatever you say Naomi I'll do all right two things to look at when you're choosing somebody pay attention to their community because their Community is the greatest influence in their life and if their Community is the greatest influence in their life and they don't have a community that looks anything like the beliefs that you have then that Community will speak to which direction that person is going so look at the person's Circle we like to ignore circles because we feel like I'm not my friends my friends not me yes you are if you were an angry group of people you angry all the time if you're ready to fight yo you ready you ready everybody ready you ever seen a group of people and you're like what's wrong with everybody [Music] everybody ready to go I'm sick of it you sick of it I'm sick everybody around me I'm sick of it let's go wait wait do you have anybody in your group like can we talk about this like before we rush in can we can we can your community matters in your Pursuit and you need to get the voice of other people in your life who know you and who are not tied down by their emotions because we love secretive relationships because we already have seen red flags and we don't want anybody to mess up our feet so we don't bring them around oh no do they believe in marriage I don't know what are you talking about when you get to can I be a father for what are you talking about when you get together is it the fine dining that you love foreign can I give y'all a tip real quick stop going on an expensive dinners for your first date because you're being wooed by something you will not see daily [Applause] get at me like [Applause] that's this let's go sit down and talk at Chick-fil-A all right that's a little pricier hey chicken's a little bit pricier let me go do that let's go sit down and talk at Chick-fil-A you mean that twelve dollar there we go so you cheat that's what you're saying see it comes out of it your community matters because it speaks to where you are and it speaks to what's being deposited on the inside of you if you don't have someone in your life being able to tell you hey I'm seeing some signs and from these signs that I see I think something is unhealthy you need some you need some people in your life that will tell you the truth I don't need everybody in my business you don't have no important business it is not that deep can I be just tell your neighbor real quick it's not that deep trying to keep you from jacking up your life I'm just trying to help you you don't know him you don't know her she's a good person if I get on that real quick stop telling people and convincing people with what they should already see [Applause] you know he's a good man great and it should come out on what he does and who he is not in what y'all get to unravel in secret if you have to unravel goodness then it ain't all the goodness you think it is you don't know his heart you don't know her heart Pastor I don't need to know that heart I can see their actions because if they were who they are then in their stay season they would have been working on them and you need to work up with somebody and listen and connect with them and say so what were you doing while you were single and if they say oh I was dating everywhere you need to be like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait have you had a break for you do you know who you are and where you are because if you don't I'm pretty sure when you get with me you're carrying whatever you just carry into this just as well so you can't break it can oh can I tell somebody real quick marriage fixes nothing if they jacked up now they jacked up at the altar and they'll be jacked up when they get home [Applause] I married people in here like oh Jesus if I could tell you [Applause] and controlling down they're controlling later you better talk about it if you tell me what to do one more time [Applause] because we love fixing it to our vantage point because we have a world my wife and I were just talking about this we have a world that lives in unrealistic spaces they just live in no reality there's an escape to a different world is do y'all understand what metaverse was it was an escape from we out here celebrating like church in the metaverse uh no we are not escaping into alternate realities where the enemy who is the prince of the air and who has demand and Dominion in Earth [Music] finds himself at the place where he's manipulating things constantly so that they can appeal to you because the way you choose is through your sight and your feelings good at that but when we get down to the real understanding of it we understand that the way in which we should be choosing to say God what is it that you have for me to have I'm gonna tell you right now if you see all the red flags get out now and not in the marriage don't play with me don't you play with me I don't don't you do it this that's where that three second clip comes from where they cut that part off and you get if you're not in it that's what he said he said that this is the pursuit season let's be clear and the last but not least choose with Grace you are not perfect can I say that you are not perfect so stop pursuing with this idea of looking for the perfected person to come into your life without recognizing you got your own mess so choose with Grace other than that you need equal matches how many degrees you got all right well I'm one degree shot so I'll see you later all right what is your credit score he's like hey are these important things yes but I need you to be gracious because what you built a list of is a list of Perfections that put yourself in the place where you don't see the reflection of who you are one of the scariest things is to speak out of your mouth about everything you see but not speak out of your mouth about what you're dealing with it's real easy y'all we can run into that thing real quick yeah you know because you know how I am I I got it together no you don't be honest you're having breakdowns be honest you're having a problem keeping relationships be honest you don't have accountability be honest you have failed at a relationship before so stop building a case for yourself and be gracious for who you are but understand also in your stay season that you know who God has called you to be it doesn't mean I let down my standard but it does not mean I choose going around finding the wrong and everybody else you know you got to have it together oh you got it together [Music] no we're called to living in Grace my wife and I we travel this week and we had such a good time because we had the opportunity to just talk in and share and laugh and I'm gonna tell y'all this quick story [Music] you know how sometimes you just got to learn to be honest we had an honest moment y'all I'm be I'll be straight my wife booked a hotel room by by accident let me start off with that um we got a little you know apps we use because I'm cheap I'm gonna allow you know that I'm Frugal let's say that I'm Frugal and I believe and you don't always have to spend thousands of dollars right because we we find the best deal I want to find out where the luxury hotel is for cheap so there's an app I put her on I was like check this app out hotel tonight I got you I got you don't leave you out there like that cam look that hotel tonight and you know somebody's a novice I don't know what they doing [Music] she go on the App flicking and looking at stuff and press the button and book the room screens out oh my God I booked the room said and where is that she begins to tell me the hotel I literally almost had a tear come down my I said I'll come out with a disease [Music] so it wasn't that bad y'all it wasn't a bad it wasn't but but we we get to this the hotel we're like all right we'll deal with it it's only for like one night we're okay we get into the room there's double beds [Applause] we get in there I'm like oh my gosh Jesus and we are pretty wild sleepers so we're moving and you know how you you know you got your sleeping way so we get into there's a queen been a queen bed and I was like uh which one you take it so she says to me uh I'm not taking no big we're gonna sleep together in this one suited yourself we'll see how this goes middle of the night my wife gets up and begins to take a walk I said where you going she said over here [Applause] to that bed yep [Applause] she said because every time I moved in the bed you looked at me in a demonic way haha I said I told you this from the beginning I I was truthful with you the idea is that oftentimes we cannot be truthful with the place we are because we have preconceived notions as somebody told us this is the way that it's supposed to be this is the way that it's supposed to look this is the way that it comes this is the way in which you have to create it and make it look and God I'm here to let you know no you're not called to choose by what you see you're called to choose by wisdom to have a community of people some of you don't choose well so you need people in your life to be able to tell you I see some things not a good choice [Music] I'm recognizing some areas not the best thing and not your single friend who's single with you because obviously they have not reached the prize oh girl what you think therefore she's still searching he's still searching let me go to somebody you've been in this thing for a couple years tell me why don't you what should I be looking at that's where the multitude of counsel that's when saying I want to set my life up to succeed the best way possible is what God called for you to do today there is no perfect way in how to choose but there is a directional way in a Godly way that God is calling for you to seek to search to pursue and I believe today that as you do this you'll see God's presence over your life over your marriage over your relationships and you'll see it manifest in a way like never before can we can we thank God for the word today Hallelujah
