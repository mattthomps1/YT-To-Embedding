[Music] you've got a real big round of applause [Applause] listen my name is pastor tyrone smack and it is always a privilege and an honor to be with you guys put a smile on your face let me just see you let me see it there to go there well you know what time it is it's time to get it on in the word of god you know we say around here if you have your phone or your notepad pull it out because world changers are what they're note takers and leaders are what leaders are readers if you do not have a bible today that's cool we got one for you we put it on the screen so if you don't you know use we used to lean over and look at our neighbor's bible but you can pull out your app on your phone if you have a bible app you should get one if you don't we got it on the screen for you today but let's pray let's get into the word of god father we thank you father we applaud you with more than our hands have the capacity to do thank you for your love thank you for your tender mercies now navigate us through this moment god bring to each row the clarity that goes beyond what i have the ability to say god i pray lord god that it will be so crystal clear what it is you are trying to say to us today that we all walk away in courage that we all walk away changed and that our baptism lists would grow immensely because of the outward thing that you're doing in this place today it's in jesus name we pray amen amen and amen now listen really quick i just want to give y'all some really quick fun facts uh we're going to be turning to i want y'all to y'all could do this ahead of time we're going to get to psalms 103. that's what we're going to be at right psalms 103 but i want to tell you a couple things about the psalms really quick the psalms it's it's 66 books in the bible say that with me 66 books there's 66 books in the bible 65 of them speak to you there's one that speaks for you that's the book of psalms the book of psalms speaks for you when you don't have the right words to say the book of sounds just open it up you know if you want to hear the voice of god i say it like this if you want to hear the voice of god read his word out loud if you don't have anything you ran out of things to say to god go to the book of sounds and read it out loud i guarantee you it'll speak for you the book of psalms is a book of songs anybody have a favorite album you have a favorite album right and you know how those lyrics and that that favorite album just speak for you it's like man these are all the words that i would have said about love you know how that is right you know this see my favorite album is purple rain don't judge me that's my favorite artist prince is my favorite artist i just it's just my favorite artist and i don't care what y'all think about that that's my favorite artist all right and i'm living with that i'm sticking with that shout out to prince okay and so purple rain is my favorite album and the song purple ring just happens to be one of my favorite songs right and when you know the backdrop of it i'm not going to get into all that but purple he put it out there one day he said purple uh rain is it was talking about the cross that's what he said i'm just telling you what he said he said you know blue is what the blood is supposed to look like before it hits oxygen that's what your blood is supposed to look like blue but when it hits oxygen it's supposed to be red that's at least what they say but blue and red make purple and he was talking about calvary he said purple rain was jesus blood running from calvary's cross that's what he said i'm just saying that's one of my favorite songs but then there's a song on there called when doves cry i love that song right if you listen to one of my last albums i have a song on there that's kind of similar to windows cry me and my wife did it shout out to my wife my beautiful wife right here and my daughter my son is over and mixed kids he's having a ball he had a ball with you some of y'all didn't even know that was my son yesterday because he was running around as soon as he got out of the car he just thought he was a part of the family he just got out took his shoes off i said son we are not in jamaica where are you why do you have your shoe your whole shoes off like what's going on anyway and so what happens is this is my song this is my album and you have one too the book of psalms does the same exact thing see sometimes some of y'all you know sometimes you may have a psalm 23 type of song on your heart the lord is my shepherd i shall not want that's a song but then some of you you may be going through some times some rough times and yours may be at psalms 22. father why has thou forsaken me i'll see i know you you can't get to 23 before you get to 22. see sometimes if you're honest there's you know i know we learned and grew up don't question god right we learned that david said why has you forsaken me that's a question jesus asked that claim kind of question on the cross that's a question god ain't scared of your questions he's he's big enough to answer your question and plus you ain't the first one that ever had it [Applause] and so what happens is the these songs are here and whatever your moment is you can sing one you can read one well today we're going to read psalms 103. i'm going to start with one through five it's on the screen it says bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your iniquities who heals all your diseases who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like eagles don't that feel good hey when you get home just read the whole thing like that you don't have to read as loud and as passionate as i just did do it how you do it you know just read it out loud but what happens is david is is talking to not an audience david is talking to himself i know i know you learned you're not supposed to talk to yourself but if you do then you at least don't answer yourself but david all throughout the psalms you start this you start to research and you try to see where the audience is and there is no audience david if you would he's in this mirror he's in his mirror and and if i could say anything to any leaders out here any anybody preparing a message listen if that message does not start in your mirror keep it to yourself because what happens is if you don't start that message in your mirror you become very rigid or self-righteous you start to handle the audience like y'all need this i don't but i always say this microphone has speakers and they connect it to your ears and mine so as much as it's for you it's for me but it started in my mirror i was talking this loud in my bathroom before i even got here i promise you this this passionate i was talking in my mirror brushing my teeth because it has to start david starts the message alone because self-righteousness you have to practice what you preach first is that is that good is that good watch this watch this watch this what else happens with self-righteousness and what it does is when you when you practice and you read the word of god you should let the word of god read you while you're reading it yeah anybody have notes that we talk about taking notes you can say you put that in your notes when you're reading the word of god make sure you allow the word of god to read you because it wants to challenge you god wants to the holy spirit i know you can search commentary ain't nothing wrong with commentary it's great to read commentary but god said if you want wisdom ask me that's my stuff this is my writings you want wisdom ask me i got some stuff for you and i can show you some stuff that will cartel to the audience i'm about to send you in front of ask me if you want wisdom start with me our most important duty in this life based on this passage of scripture our greatest joy and our most important duty is the same exact thing it is to praise god praise puts proper perspective in play it puts it gives us a proper perspective of things when we praise god praise is essential it's a must it makes god who he is and me who i am that's what praise does when you properly praise god when you continually praise god it keeps you you and him him and when you get a name when you go to the doctors i don't know who this is for when you get a name and they tell you a sickness when you get a name you take that name and say thank you i know it may be hard to encourage yourself in that moment but you make sure you get that name and then you apply his name because every name comes under the name of jesus there is no bigger name than jesus i i would love to go into a story about my my time i tour my achilles but i'll tell i'll tell y'all that another time but but there's one time you know i was i was i finished preaching at uh bible said i was teaching rather at bible study i was teaching and um and man the spirit of the lord just it was moving you know you know it's just moving i'm seeing people like accept the lord right here and it's just it was just like a casual name was people to come in off the streets you know like just kind of mid message and they were getting prayed for and getting delivered and and i'm telling you you got to hear what i'm saying and you gotta you have to make sure you you you properly praise god and so what happens is this this thing that the holy spirit gave me even as a young minister even as a young man he would tell me to go outside and just sit there and i would just sit there outside some people thought i was weird people that i was crazy it's cool you know it comes with the territory it comes with assignment right and so i just go outside and i sit there and really what it was was it was a reset it was a focus reset because i realized i ain't making none of these trees out here these birds the sky look at that sky i ain't making a cloud i ain't hang a moon or a sun you know and so what happens is i'm sitting outside and i'm resetting myself the crowd was telling me oh man you preached today you talked to they was telling me all these things and if you're not careful if you're not careful it can stroke your ego in such a way [Music] that you feel like if i don't show up it don't show up if i don't come in the room he don't come in the room and i knew it i knew it it started to sink in it started to creep in and i went outside and i sat and the whole crowd was in there and they were still in there going wild and i was sitting by a tree and i was watching the ambulances go by and planes and i remember sitting there and i said none of these people on that plane none of these people in this ambulance none of the stuff that's going on none of these people even know i exist who am i that you are mindful of me and i and i remember sitting there and i and i wrote these words and i said make me low so i will know how big you are and i said make this tenor this baritone a base so i can hear you way louder like that check in my spirit that i can't cash like that still small voice that i can't flask oh y'all know that you don't know about that still small voice that that voice that'll wake you up three o'clock in the morning and tell you i told you to do this i called you to do that and you ain't trying to do that thing he called you to do told you to do and you can't shut up you can't put a pill enough pillows on your head to shut that voice out because that's still small voice it's there it's that still small voice that i can't flash drink away see we all gonna see soon like a tape delay that you are who you said you are and i agree with who you said you are i want to tell them who you said you are but before i tell them i need you to tell me first please so lord i'm a humble myself i'ma have several seats because i need a feet view cause that's the best way for me to see you i need to know how to walk or walks how my author talks so i can illustrate the illness y'all don't hear what i'm saying when you when you wanna know him you gotta take a low approach i always say if you want to talk to the most high you got to go the most low oh you'll hear what i'm saying you got to go real low if you want to talk to the one who's high because if yeah anyway y'all got that bless the lord david said oh my soul and bless his whole and all that is within me bless his holy name maybe david in this moment is thinking about deuteronomy 8 and 12 through 14. watch this he says watch this it's on the screen it says otherwise when you eat and are satisfied when you build fine houses and settle down and when you when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied then your heart will become proud wait what what happened here why we do a a shift like this what happened here he said then your heart will become proud and you will forget the lord your god you will forget the lord your god who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery out of the land of bondage he brought you off wick remember remember he brought you out the crack house he said now that your house is so nice and now that you're eating so you got the choice of restaurant it used to be the the dollar menu at mcdonald's that was all you had and ain't nothing wrong with the dollar menu all i'm saying is that was a now you showing up at red lobster when you feel like it [Applause] david's saying it's important that you bless the lord with all your soul i'm talking about he's not just talking about the surface stuff not just what you're raising of your hand he's saying the bone marrow your earlobes your nose hairs everything you know god made all that stuff right all that stuff i know it seems crazy but your spy everything bless the lord oh my soul and all everything in me even the stuff that i don't like in me bless his holy name otherwise this is what he said he didn't say you might he didn't say it in 14 says then your heart will become proud and you will forget if we're honest in this room have we forgotten at times how good god has been if we're honest you don't have to raise your hand and i know i'm i'm i'm the leader of the game i know it's so many times where i forgot that that was the i know all my deficiencies i know listen i told you i think before last time i was here i was a kid from west philadelphia couldn't read couldn't write couldn't all and now here it is you get it go across the world god uses that that flaw i have he uses that that that feature that i don't like in class you know i'm in class and the teacher called me to read out loud and i'm being a clown in class because i don't want to read out loud because i'm a fumble over all these words and so what happens is i start being a minister in the classroom i start being a mess in the classroom because i'm trying to hide this this dysfunction i have i'm trying to hide it but i'm telling you it's the it's the feature it's the thing that god loves to use he i said this i i said this to brother jamal yesterday we were we were in the in the hotel lobby and you see the floors and i said i'm betting this hotel has another hotel that has these same exact floors same exact because this is man-made these are manufacturer you can get these done anywhere and they can just put them in all their chains if they want to but it's something about hardwood floors hardwood floors have these things in them they call what they call character you know that thing those markings in the hardwood floors you know where those come from those come from storms do you know the markings in the hardwood floor they come from storms they were in certain storms that tree was in a certain location and when it had when it went through the storm it grew these markings in it and once they put them down and your house and they shellack them and polishing them up they do all these kind of things it pray it raises your house your property value am i lying and where's where where's the liar did i lie yet did i it raises your property isn't it ironic that they call the flaws and hardwood floors character [Applause] and yet we have been trying to hide our flaws let me make it even more plain when i smile i have these things called dimples see them yeah get a close-up on the camera it's a dimple right there boom and what happens is now some people they think oh they're so cute all throughout when i was coming up they're so cute you won a smile contest they were just telling me they'd bring me down to the office in elementary school i won the smile contest cause i got dimples when i got older i did not realize that dimples is actually skin tissue missing from my face this is not how my face is supposed to look i'm supposed to have complete a whole complete cheek right there but i don't and i got them on both sides [Applause] but somehow they kept bringing me to the office to award me for a flaw a flaw was getting me awarded moses said i stutter god said i don't care about your stutter i put i put the stutter there the stutter was to make you dependent on me because if you're not dependent on me what's going to happen is every when i bring you into your nice house i remember last time i was here it was a young lady that met me out she has accepted the lord we got outside and and me and her was talking and she asked me a couple of things at four or four mil and we were talking i said we're gonna get that meal i said but miss can i ask you one thing she said yes anything i said miss the the way you feel right now the humiliation i can see in your eyes to even ask me to get you a meal as a grown woman i said i see all of it i said can you do me a favor she said yes i said bottle that up please hold on to that please because you're going to need that throughout this whole christian walk because at some point you're going to feel like now you know three scriptures and now god needs you you don't hear what i'm saying i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm gonna move on i'm gonna move on sometimes this is what i'm trying to say and all what i just said sometimes the blessings of god will blind us to the god of the blessings sometimes sometimes his stuff will blind us from him and i remember wrestling through these moments with god and i almost feel like i could hear his voice like i want to bless you because i'm a good good father but i struggle because i won't hear from you when i do the moment i give the moment you remember i don't know why this dropped in my spirit remember they used to say that you get you could buy a young lady some shoes and she gonna walk out your life remember that you'll be like yeah don't bother don't you know when i was younger don't buy no girl no shoes she can walk out your life i didn't board girls roller skates all kinds of stuff and they stayed way longer than they needed i was trying to come on achilles all kinds of stuff like i was just like go by and um no they stayed longer and so what happens is god is like man the moment i bless you with some shoes you're gonna walk out my life mom when i bless you with a car you're gonna ride right past church and he struggles to bless his people because sometimes the blessings of god will blind us to the god of the blessing because it's not natural to praise god it's natural to praise but it's not natural to praise god praise has to be intentional it has to be intentional you have to make sure you have to wake set your alarm to say today we are getting up every day at 6 30 i don't know what time you have to get up whatever that is you talk it out between you and god you get up and say every day i don't care if it's five minutes where it's just uninterrupted just you and him the moment you make the commit see the fasting is not hard when you just don't make a commitment to it when you just you be like man i didn't eat all day it's six o'clock i didn't eat a thing that's not fasting that's just dieting you just forgot to eat the moment you put a commitment on it say tomorrow tomorrow i'm fasting between six and six six a.m to six pm at some point around 5 30. you start smelling bacon and you don't know why in the world am i smelling bacon and all the people in the house is in this room who is cooking bacon it's just like bacon is bleeding through your radiators you're like what in the world is going on right now now all of a sudden now at 601 you start looking at 6 pm like when are you coming because i'm struggling it's the commitment it's easy to make a commitment it's hard to be committed to it you have to we have to learn how to be committed to our commitments okay okay cause praise is intentional praise is intentional okay okay i gotta i gotta get you i gotta get out of this this moment cause my time my time i'm out of here i promise you last time i had a three-hour message i don't know how i was looking at that clock back there and i was like which one is mine i don't know but i ain't gonna break stride i know exactly which one is mine i put all kinds of bumpers in my service today so we're going to get out of here on time i promise you god has entrusted us watch this watch this it says verse 2 it says bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefit they are all his benefits they are his like my kids our kids are they they are they're benefiting from our benefits that's why they can go to the dentist huh yeah but one day mama one day they gonna get oh my my teens used to my teams used to oh they used to cringe when i would come down and do the intro for service i'd be like good morning they'd be like good morning i'd be like you are one sunday closer to your own bills closer to your own insurance that was my intro every sunday because what i was doing i was trying to make sure that they had a respect for mom and dad's hard work you don't hear what i'm saying when mom and dad go to work hard and you can go to the dentist that ain't just practicing on your mouth you understand what i'm saying y'all hear what i'm saying y'all know what i mean i had to go to a lot of dentists that was just practicing it was like did they get a report card after they finished with me and i'm like i need somebody's trained in this what is going on in my mouth y'all understand what i'm saying these are all his benefits these all his his benefits and here's the beautiful thing god has given us some benefits i want to just go through one of them real quick i'm going to just cut the chase real quick one of the benefits is forgiveness that's what it says it says who forgives all your iniquities anybody in here excited about forgiveness watch this watch this watch this watch this in psalms 103 verse 10 through 12. this is what it says it says he has not dwelt with us according to our sins nor punished us according to our iniquities for as he says for as for the heavens as far as the heavens are above the earth so great is his mercy toward those who fear him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us i don't know if you ever you ever known this or heard this but if you start out west and you walk east they will never come together you will never come back west again you would they they will they will never meet each other again you just when you start out west and you walk east you will never come back west again that's what this is what he's saying he said he said i put your sin as far as the east it's from the west oh no let me can i make it plainer he says this is what he's saying he says he says i make sure the forgiving sinner and his forgiving sin never meet up again is that good news is that he said i make sure that y'all never meet again that's the type of forgiveness that our god has in his benefits package when i used to when i used to play well i still i still play games i'm still a gamer um anybody who plays madden or 2k i'll give you my gamertag after the conclusion of this message so that we can keep fellowshipping huh fellowshipping in the game i'll be aggressive off my mic at home i'll just be loud in my house because i'm very passionate about the game and so when i used to play the game for any gaming gamers in the room any people that play madden or any kind of things like that any kind of game so back in the day you know back in the day you know when you would get a game what happened was matt and when it first came out it used to have you know like they go from the first one and then the second one they put these new features in there it was like you could hurdle and you could shoot string catch and then you could spin and all these kind of things and what happened was i would be playing one of my friends who had the game as well and he'd be sitting over there looking at me and i'm doing all these new stuff and i'm catching out of bounds like this and all kinds of stuff catching it by my feet and he's sitting over there the whole time how you do that how you do that like when you if you hit the a button and you you'll be able to do the shoestring catch and how you do that how you say you're cheating you're cheating how you just spin off me like see you cheating how you do that and i'm saying that like oh you hit the beat but you got to let go of the speed burst so you can do it and yeah and we playing and he's sitting there and he's getting upset at me the whole time he got the book so what happens is so what happens is madden used to come with a book in the back in the in the case remember that you would get the game and all the games and used to tell you how to do all the features you would learn how to do all the features because you spent a little time with the book y'all hear what i'm saying so so what happened is if you spent the little time with the book you would know all the benefits in the book you would know all the benefits from the game if you just spent a little time in the book and there's some people that may be upset with you there's some people some family members that may be upset with you because they see features that they have the ability to obtain but they don't want to spend no time in the book you know what i'm saying if you just spend time in the book you can have access to the same benefits do y'all hear what i'm saying okay okay all right all right so listen the homework is cause i gotta get out of here the homework is for you to go through this this beautiful passage and i want you to see all the benefits and when you see what david's benefits were what i want you to do is write down your own i want you i want you to remix the song y'all hear what i'm saying i want you to i want you to put your own bit come on this got to be our homework i want you to take this seriously go home and write your psalms 103. write your song and say god you have been faithful [Music] oh so faithful and i want you to write it out and i want you to tell him all the benefits he has in your life healing i remember i remember this and i gotta just i'ma say it really quick i remember uh 2010 um 2010 was a it was a lot of it was a lot in that year and um and in 2010 i remember um i was at i was working at the airport um is it okay if i share the story baby i know we out there right now because you're like is it okay if i share it no okay um on to another one right right with a weird moment to ask right and so in 2000 right in 2010 i'm working at the airport and i get a call that my wife has um um uh bleeding and from her brain she has she's having a brain hemorrhage at the time but we don't know that just yet and so i'm i'm i'm at this job and i'm i'm in training at the airport and so in training you can't you don't have a lot of wiggle room you have to be there you got to work your flights you got to do all that until you get off and so i go to um to the leader in charge i say hey man listen i gotta go my wife is having a brain hemorrhage i i have to go i have to get down to um to this hospital they seen bleeding on her brain i gotta go and have being though i had already been through a moment like this i just knew i i got to get out of here because i i lost a family member due to this moment same way then i'm like i got to get out of here speed up the story my wife is taking it to the head trauma unit in philadelphia and so i'm at home because i can't stay there and i'm at home and and they told me before i left they said everything's gonna be over all right we're gonna just you know check on everything make sure everything's cool and i said okay cool and so and so the next morning about 4 30 in the morning nobody ever wants to hear the phone ring at 4 30 in the morning you know nobody nobody unless she was one of them teenagers back in the day and he was holding the because you knew that cause about the people hello yeah you know you remember that right so 4 30 in the morning i get this call and they said mr smack i said yes they said we need your consent we got to move forward and i just and it overwhelmed me i was like oh i said put my wife on the phone i said put my wife on the phone in my heart i know what to think i know what to do i'm like put my wife on the phone and i remember they said they had just seen too much blood they had just seen too much and i and i said man and i'm i'm emotional i'm trying to figure this out and i remember the day i was going to pick my wife up they said mrs mack you can come pick her up now everything's clear we see nothing and i remember driving down i remember driving down to pick my wife up and they said that and the holy spirit said when you first got the news what did they say i said man they said they seen too much blood he just said what did they say just now when you got a phone call from he said they ain't seen nothing he said what they say on the front end said it seemed too much blood he said what they say on this and say they say nothing see they see you too much blood the reality is one of the benefits is he is a healer [Applause] and he will heal he said 37 seconds watch this when you fall and you skin your knee what happens is i remember trying to understand the blood when you fall in your skin your knee there is this thing that comes on your knee young people it's called a scab and i remember trying to understand the blood and the scab and i was sitting there one day being a little nasty kid and i was sitting there picking my scab my mom came to the door stop picking your scab or your sore won't heal you don't hear what i'm saying and so what happens is i was trying to understand the blood and the lord took me back to my mom saying don't pick your scab because all the all the scab is is dried up blood because the healing is under the blood
