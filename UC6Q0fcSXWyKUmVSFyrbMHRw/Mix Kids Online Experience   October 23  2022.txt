that Batman did not have a superpower he had a cool suit some neat gadgets and even a Batmobile but no special power he couldn't fly he had no super strength he couldn't climb any buildings he did have a friend named Robin who helped him and was always there when he needed him just like Batman has Robin we have Jesus when we are Christ children we are never alone he's always there when we need him let's think who has God placed in your life to help you write it in the chat below how about your parents an older brother or sister maybe your pet snake I don't think he helps much but how about your teacher or a friend or your dog how about Jesus now who do you help another ex ordinary turned extraordinary person in the Bible is Moses Moses was born during a time when Israelite males were to be put to death but God chose Moses he had a special plan that he needed Moses to carry so he couldn't let him be killed let's learn about one of the incredible things that Moses did to make him a superhero this is Moses who was an Israelite born in Egypt in a time when Israelite boys were not supposed to live oh Moses however grew up in the Palace of the Pharaoh the very man who was enslaving the Israelite people when Moses grew up he made a big mistake wow so Moses ran away from Egypt to the land of Midian after many years an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses and told him to go back to Egypt to free the Israelites after much protesting God granted Moses his brother Aaron to speak on his behalf so Moses went to Egypt damn over there and on his way there he met Aaron who was ready to do whatever God wanted him to do the Israelites were slaves to the Egyptians but God had a special plan for Moses [Music] after rallying God's people to them Moses and Aaron went to the pharaoh a ham and said this is what the Lord the god of Israel has said let my people go [Music] and Pharaoh made the Israelites work harder because of this hey how are you the foreman of the Israelite slaves were angry with Moses and Aaron for causing this trouble [Music] uh so Moses cried out to God and asked why this was happening but God said see what I will do I am the Lord I will deliver you from slavery wow okay hey Moses told this to the people all right all right but they were so discouraged that they didn't listen to him God told Moses to go to pharaoh and to do exactly as he said so Moses and Aaron went to the Pharaoh hey ah God told them to take the staff and throw it down before Pharaoh huh Pharaoh was not impressed he called his wise men and Sorcerers and they did the same thing [Music] but Aaron's staff swallowed up the sorcerer staff yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he would not listen to them just as God had said then the Lord said to Moses go to the banks of the Nile river and meet Pharaoh Steve Moses and Aaron did just as God had said but again Pharaoh's magicians did the same miracle and Pharaoh refused to let God's people go [Music] so God sent nine more plagues to Egypt to show his power [Music] even with all the suffering Pharaoh's heart stayed hard and he would not let the people go foreign on the night of the last plague Pharaoh woke up huh and heard a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house in Egypt where someone was not dead Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and told him to be gone with the Israelites so the Israelites left Egypt immediately and made their way to the promised land taking with them many riches from Egypt and they took Joseph's bones as they had promised him many years before but after they had gone pharaoh changed his mind and readied his army to take back the Israelites when the Israelites saw pharaoh and his Armies come they were terrified but God made a way for them through all of this the Israelites saw the great power of their God the one true God and they put their trust in Moses his servant just like Moses you may feel like you are just an ordinary kid with nothing special about you you are wrong God loves to choose ordinary people just like you and me to do super great incredible things we don't need superpowers when we have Jesus with us when we belong to Christ we also belong to God's family when we are Christ we will never be alone again just like Batman wasn't alone because he had Robin and Moses wasn't alone because he had Aaron our memory verse for this week says you are to be holy to me because
