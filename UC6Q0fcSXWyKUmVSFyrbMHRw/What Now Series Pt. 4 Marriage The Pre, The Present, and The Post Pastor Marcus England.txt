[Music] uh we're gonna jump into the scripture proverbs chapter four proverbs chapter 4. we're going to hit verse 7 and i want to start off with this because it's so important one thing i know is that we always feel we know how to love but we don't know what to do after we love and so we uh we get in love we we find somebody some of us have gotten married and we get excited but i don't know if some very folk want to be honest in here uh y'all were in love but once you got married you didn't know what you were doing you were just in there fighting for the fences figuring each other out uh trying to figure what each other loved and if you loved and then you you went from being in love to not liking you know what i mean i love you but i don't like you you know what i mean so uh we we're exploring what true relationship looks like in marriage and and we're going to talk about to that today but here's what i believe without the information we cannot make the right decisions and so god is holding us accountable for what we knew so today we're gonna really push to understand what god is saying about marriage so we say take out your pins and your notepads and your phones because here we believe that notetakers or what world changes whether you're online or in person take your pad pencil your bible out we're about to jump into the word of god i have my initial scripture that i want to come from today which is proverbs chapter 4 verse 7 and it says this wisdom is supreme wisdom is supreme so get wisdom it's that simple can i tell you sometimes the most simple things feel like the most complicated things but proverbs is writing for for those of you that don't understand wisdom is supreme so it says so get wisdom and it says and whatever else you get get understanding it's not enough just to have knowledge about something you've got to get somebody say understanding so i want to come from the title today of marriage the pre the present and the post the pre the present and the prose let's talk about this today but let's pray first father in the name of jesus we're asking today the lord everything that is said in this moment god that you would speak words of life into us we're not here to just be hearers of your word but we also want to apply and to be doers of the word you've called us to father open our hearts where they are closed we want to be set free and to know what you've called for us to do so that we can have the best life possible in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians truly appreciate you can we give it up for those that are our superstars our all-star team around here can we give it up for the dream team here y'all i'm excited i'm excited listen let's get into this word of god and i believe this i want you to have the wisdom and an understanding to be able to have the best relationship possible to have the best amazing relationship marriage whatever state you're in i need it to be complete and full in god and so we've been talking about working on what is called our singleness our singleness is something that we've defined as being separate whole and somebody say unique every one of us is unique god called all of us to be whole without someone else and he has called for us to live in what the plan and purpose that he has spoken over our life and today i believe it's a great opportunity for us to dive in what is the responsibility of today the responsibility of today is to put us in position so that as we position ourselves for the best life possible that we have an understanding of how to get there there's something like somebody offering you something but you don't know directionally or what you do in order to get there and what i want to make sure is that we're not entering into marriage and relationships trying to do a diy y'all know how you do you do it yourself let me figure this out as i go let me figure it out when people get in the atmosphere i want to give you what's needed so in order to do so let's jump into genesis chapter two we're gonna hit verse 24 and 25 i want you to get god's word in you because god's word is what changes us it is the very life that we need so it starts at verse 24 and says this therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave somebody say cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh verse 25 says and they were both naked that's a quick transition did nothing it got serious real fast y'all that we went from we're leaving and cleveland too we got naked that's that's so i listen i i didn't say this in the first service but when you find somebody that you are attracted to that you have a heart for can i tell you that thing can accelerate so fast that you don't even know what's happening the bible says they left the father and mother and cleave and it says and the two became one flesh next sentence next verse says and they were naked it was like whoa whoa whoa what happened did we did they move in together what took place for this to move so fast and the bible says when they became one the privilege or the ability the passion that was there was able to be expressed in the marriage itself and it says the man and his wife were not ashamed they were not ashamed i want you to keep that because that's important for you to know as we dive a little bit further and so i want to talk about the pre and when i want to talk about pre-marriage i want to talk about what's your dating life look like what's what's your dating life looking like today how how intentional are you in your dating how how how how intentional are you at finding the individual that god has in store for you for the bible lets us know that when eve was created it says that god brought eve to adam but he did not force adam to be with eve can i explain that today to somebody who honestly believes that god has already found my mate and uh and he's going to tell me who it is can i tell you today that that god will bring people in front of you and they will bring people to to show you but god is not telling you this is who you're called to marry because if god tells you who to marry god's responsible for the outcome of your decisions so we're learning that okay so we're dating now here's how you get it you get into dating you start talking some of you you you you know how that is you you're talking you're getting to know them and and you got your hand your filters in in a lot of different places you you're talking to this one over there you're talking to that one and here's the term that we use we are just talking because we're what we're just friends anybody know about that friendship everybody know about that friendship that can run a muck on you so quick you can't even you don't even know what to do we just friends y'all we we're not serious like we we're taking our time and as we're recognizing okay we're taking our time what we're doing is beginning to add the value this is really important because the way in which you value a relationship is the way in which you sacrifice for what you believe and what you find is valuable anybody know real quick i have had a pair i'm not saying anything about it but you know after you've worn those payless shoes a couple of times you know ladies if it's those flat ones eventually that soul is going to wear yes you got a bow go by but the problem is is you're going to need both of them to be able to keep up with where you're going because at the end of the day you're going to start feeling that cold concrete on the bottom of your feet why because the value of the shoe cannot meet the demand of your feet pastor i got some payloads on right now god bless you but you're gonna have to get another bogo because you're gonna need another pair because they're gonna wear out soon the context is the greater the cost the more the value how do we put that into today's term the bible lets us know in john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever would believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life how do we understand our word the bible says that we are worth so much that god gave himself for us did you understand how much you're worth do you understand your value do you understand the greatness that god came out of heaven and came into the flesh of a human being just to save your life before you even chose him can i tell you today you're worth a lot can i tell you today you you're worth more than what you think you are can i tell you today it's something special can you just tell your neighbor real quick you're kind of special you're kind of special i don't know if you know that but you're kind of special i don't know if you see yourself that way but you're kind of special because if you're kind of special what it means is that the way in which you value you is not determined on the way that someone else values you you're walking to a place and somebody may not say nothing but you say i feel good about myself today i i i feel good if nobody else gonna take a picture of me that's why they call them selfies because i don't need you to see what i see because i already see what i need to see i want to let you know if you don't value you you can't have the expectation that someone else is going to give you the value that you deserve that's how you'll know if someone values you well because of the way in which you see your self the bible says that you're so valued that god gave his one and only son the question today is do you understand that when you're searching for someone you need to understand that they must see the value in you that god sees in you and when you see that value you'll be intentional about making sure they live up to the standard of what they're saying so here's what i want to let you know the standard is not about how much money they have the standard is about how much they value who you are sometimes we're so concerned about the things that don't matter that we over emphasize the wrong things he's got to make this the problem is he makes that but he doesn't see enough in you to spend it on you he might make it it don't mean he gonna give it can i share something with you today if you don't understand your value you'll settle for what anybody gives you i don't want i want to tell you about that so your dating has to be about understanding your value worth and when you get in the presence of someone else they can be able to explain to you what they see your value to be and if our values equal that's why values are important if our values equal then guess what we've got a next direction to go that's why when you are unevenly yoke you'll see that in the bible what does that mean pastor it means when you have a christian and a non-christian it means the problem that comes with it is our values are different you see god differently than i see god and if we don't see god the same way then the problem that happens is is when it comes time to following his word and following his path and following his will we're going to bump heads because what you think god is calling it may be different than what i think god is calling because my value of god is that he is supreme he is omnipresent he is omnipotent he is omniscient and you're saying i invite him in when it's convenient so guess what happens we have a different value system and valuing now it determines what we're going to do and i'm going to talk about this word which is sex no he didn't say that in church church is a holy place the problem is is we don't talk about it enough because we don't understand the expectations from it can i tell you today if sex wasn't of god we would need mixed kids i'm just trying to tell y'all we got mixed kids because of a reason because people are having children and children are not coming from storks and they're not coming from the air they are coming from sex just got nervous saying oh god jesus he said it in the house of the lord i'ma say it again so you better be okay so i want to talk about premarital sex why because it's so important for you to understand the clarity of why god does not okay pre-marital sex why because the idea is is if i can give you what the wisdom and understanding you can make the best decisions here's the problem i've learned a lot of times that people told me what to do without giving me clarity so when it's time for me to get understanding and make a decision in the moment i'm trying to make a decision off of what somebody told me not to do not off of the understanding of i know what the effects of it are and so some of us can i tell you when them lights go off they y'all know y'all got them dimmers in your house when that light dims that candle is sparked when that nice jazz music comes on when the flavor is in the house that good smelling flavor when you when you're sitting beside each other can can i be honest with you you're not thinking about pastor marcus i even want to say this i hope you're not thinking about me that's just weird but you should be thinking about god's word and what god's word is establishing on the inside of you that's why the bible says thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee it's not going to be what i say it's going to be what god says job said this he said this in job 31-1 he said i made a covenant with my eyes not to let them lust after any girl job made a covenant why because it was important that he understood that if he opened the pathway to something that he could not control the result of it would be more detrimental to him than to anybody else for the bible lets us know when we sin when we come in adultery when we're having premarital sex it is the only sin that is against the body job said i made a covenant with my eyes matthew 5 28 says but i say to you that everyone who looks somebody say looks everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart so what is the pathway to lust the pathway to lust starts at the door of looking somebody say looking yup that's why you have to protect your eyes which are the gateway to what you begin to imagine and see why is looking such an issue because looking prompts your mind to want to desire more anybody ever open your social media app and it just tripped you out you've been there before i have been there before i've been a pastor just you know because people probably think i only follow churches or something i don't know what people think he's only got churches it should be only churches on his i was like no i follow like actual people but sometimes the actual people do things that aren't conducive but what needs to set me up anybody i've been there before you know how that works you you you start i pop open the app and it's something it's a picture there and i'm i got you almost got to throw your phone charles i like i'm explaining if my staff is with me i'm like yeah oh oh i don't know who somebody somebody broke into my account i don't know who i was not following this person but you notice the enemy is so good with making sure that we see because that in which we see begins to tempt what we want to do you got to be careful that you don't go too far and do too much why because the idea behind it is is that you'll create a lustful intent in your heart and what you create in your heart you've got to be careful that it doesn't come out in your actions that's why you're like let young people watch what they want i'm like no here's the problem it's staring seeds on the inside of you it's not about trying to be controlling it's about you don't want to plant the wrong seeds on the inside why because the wrong seeds will produce the wrong fruit and the wrong fruit will bring about the wrong struggles he says what i say to you if if this is the way that you go this is the lust that you have in your heart if you look at a woman this way then you're committing adultery women can i tell you we're going to reverse that if you are looking if if if all if all the people on your social media is working out because you talking about you trying to get fit but all you got is brothers oiled up [Music] and you're talking about i'm just trying to see how they do aerobics i just want to make sure that i'm doing my exercises right because i i'm working on my tricepsula that's not even a muscle i don't even know what you're talking about it's like you you're working you're like that what is that yeah yeah i'm just i'm trying to keep up make sure i'm eating right you know you can eat right without the man with his shirt off on every post ladies can i tell you what you're looking at is impacting what you do and let me tell you why it's so important because what you're looking at is opening a pathway to your heart and heart will create some things and here's where we're going to have the in the issue for christian couples is that the context behind what you're trying to do is that your idea is that you want to enter into a marriage where a man is leading the home the problem is is that you're asking for something that if you operate outside the parameters of a marriage you're already creating a downfall for where your marriage can even go premarital sex means you begin to create a pathway to the things that brings what a dissension or a disobedience against god why because any time that you are having premarital sex what's happening is is you're sneaking you're lying you're being deceitful and you're what living out of shame because the bible says what they weren't ashamed why because they were in consent and they were in obedience with god when you're not you feel it come to church pastor you ain't have to do all that that was the first service you ain't had to do all that he was trying to hit me hard i wasn't trying to hit you hard i was just reading what the bible says and the reason their shame is because you're trying to do something that you have not been given the okay to do now let me tell you something real quick here's where we suffer in our scripture and in our understanding because what we want is in marriage which i'm going to get to is this husband that leads by god this godly man and then we want husbands these wives who are submissive and here's where we're going to run into the problem nobody's leading and nobody's submitting and why is that because we created pathways in our dating that created spirits that now live in our marriage so you're having premarital sex and what's happening is because you're sneaking and you're lying and you're being deceitful you're expecting it to resolve because you get married but the problem is is you started sowing a seed to something that cannot die unless it's destroyed and the only way it can get destroyed is by god breaking the bondage of it and so when you do things outside of the will of god you open the portal now you have a man in marriage that you're expecting to be godly and to lead but the problem is is because there was lustful intent in the premarital state of being married this person now struggles with hearing the holy spirit and being connected to the holy spirit why because we started off ignoring god so what do i do i have to look for someone who can lead themselves a man that can lead himself a man that can lead himself i'ma talk to the fellows in the house a man that can lead himself not about how much money a man that can lead himself if they don't have a standard with themself they won't have one with you pastor what are you saying they can't control themselves outside the marriage what makes you think control is going to come in the marriage you hear what i'm saying so we can't create and open pathways and doors to things that we're expecting to change because of a marital status you have to put yourself in space to be able to say i need someone that if i'm on the bad day with it they're on the good day with it and if they're on a bad day with it i'm on a good day with it why because we're seeking after to please god not our selves so when i now get married i don't have an expectation of the man of god that can lead me because he was already ignoring the holy spirit before we got here and i wanted submissive wife even though she's not willing to submit to god so you will never get a submissive wife if they can't submit to god if they can't submit to god how they gonna submit to you no not good am i good am i good because y'all like nah pastor it's slim picking out here slim picking it's slim picking out here we gotta we got to go for what it's just available and god has said when you settle for what's available you get the leftovers of what they have have you asked them where's the vision not the job the vision because men our thought process is that providing us providing gives us the right to lead vision gives us the right to lead not finances your finances can't lead you anywhere it can only open doors if you have finances let's run this real quick if you have finances but no vision then what will it open the door for you to do nothing but what wasted because you have no direction for it pastor i need a man to have it all together i'm not asking for him to have it all together i'm just asking for him to care about having it more together than you do because cause some of us are taking on diy projects ladies to help raise boys into men and they haven't shown you that they're a man they've shown you that they can be faithful enough right now it's quiet up in here ain't it because here's the post part of it the post part is pastor we need help because we need you to get us out of this because they don't understand and it's like they didn't understand before we acknowledge that but the problem is is you weren't willing to see it because you were so in love because y'all were bonded because you were having sex here's why i got to teach this because when people get into church they're trying to fight off something without there actually being a knowledge of it and so now we've entered what we've allowed cheating deception we've allowed disobedience to the holy spirit and we get into marriage and what do i want to hear i need him to be a godly man and lead our home like now like like do we want to do that now pastor that's what i need and he's not standing up real real quick was this important for you when you weren't married because if it was there would have been a standard that you already saw because when it crosses over for some reason single people think it's going to change can some married people tell them it's not all right don't yell too loud because y'all get you get in trouble you're going to get in trouble now i got to repair your marriage because you yelled out too loud all loud and suffering in a in the church i'm getting the email after service pastor you don't mind can you put me on your schedule for thursdays i yelled out too loud it got offensive but my question is what's your expectation level for what you have not set a standard for your loneliness is not the standard child oh i might not get through this one um men have a problem men have a problem with being challenged when they know they're not already meeting the expectations of themselves and i i laugh at it because i i kind of like well where's your direction i have young ladies in my church pastor i want to marry him okay cool cool what's his vision where is he going what's the next year look like how long is it going to take you to get married oh i don't know why don't you know isn't this what you've been seeking and praying for i'm just asking y'all cause we got some loose standards out here i'm just gonna be honest y'all out here dating anything that is available i mean anything i'm gonna be a real pastor today anything if it's free and open you're dating it if they got a job and they breathing you dating it oh oh oh oh oh okay real quick so i heard this thing right i was i was i was listening to this thing and people were like y'all ever heard the word called body count what's your body count your body count is how many people you've been with can we be like let's be straight in here i just gave y'all some lingo that you did not know your body count is how many people you slept with i've heard it said listen you don't want to know what the body count is the problem i say is i need to know some past because i need to know what challenge i'm digging myself into you know the past is the past no it passes the past and it opened up some portals that i'm gonna have to deal with in the present so no tell me what's happening here and then tell me why we on number eight and now i'm the one we don't like that y'all don't like this it's all right there's a pattern i'm just saying where read the scripture pastor all right first corinthians chapter 6 verse 15 through 18. i'll just read the scripture i'll do what i'm supposed to do says this i didn't i didn't set it up like this it just came up like this do you not know that your bodies are members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute never or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her for as it is written the two will become one flesh pause right there you thought that was only marriage so you're like oh i can sleep with it's not gonna have an impact no it absolutely is and it's going to present challenges in your life that keeps it hard for you to find the right one so finding the right one isn't hard because there's a lack of finding the right one is hard because you're trying to figure out what other bodies do you need to deal with because people have become one flesh with so many other people you got to figure out what people you're in order to get to the person it's hard no it's hard because the challenge is is you haven't dealt with some of your past so your feelings of insecurity come out of your broken past your your your protected heart comes out of your broken past you didn't deal with it now you got to heal from it problem is we like healing while being relationships i just got out of a relationship oh that's what's up you single right now no i'm just talking to a couple people wait well don't you want to figure out what happened no no no it just ain't work out but real quick y'all weren't like together together were you no because it's only official if it's two you got to be talking talking together together married married or single single you single i'm single single that mean you ain't got nobody in sight like who you live just me and jesus it says the two become one flesh but then he goes and says this but but he who is joining to the lord becomes one spirit with him so if you break the spirit that you have with god it means you don't have an opportunity to be connected with what he's calling and saying for you to do so premarital sex is not about just being obedient to god even though that should be enough it's about you are creating avenues openings portals you're disconnecting yourself with god and you're connecting yourself with another flesh and when flesh overrides the spirit you're no longer following god you're following you moving on choosing i know y'all didn't like that so we're going to keep on moving that third thing that i want to get you is in to choose who how are you making a choice can i tell you dating in secret is not cool let me tell you why i want people to know my business you ain't got no business your business is you got broken relationships that's your business you got pass that's the business the business that you really need to get into is what do people see that are close to me that i can't see and the reason we hate introducing that is because we don't want anyone to tell us the things that we actually already know and see pastor what do you think do we know god well he's coming to church then wait till he knows god and then you go in don't diy because if so you're gonna have to diy in your marriage you're gonna have to put them back together you're gonna have to create this space you're gonna have to figure them out you're gonna while we do so much work in marriage instead of doing the work before marriage it's all right to tell somebody what you're doing i'm getting myself together because i know i'm a little crazy no no i've had way too many attachments and every time i get into a relationship i get reattached so now you have people who are dating operating as if they're married cool so let's talk about the president somebody say the present ephesians 5 33 let's go over this real quick however each man among you without exception is to love his wife as his very own self with behavior worthy of respect and esteem and it says and always seeking the best for her an attitude of loving kindness and the wife must see to it that she respects and delights in her husband that she notices him prefers him and treats him with loving concern treasuring him honoring him and holding him dear now what's the role the role of the husband is to lead not to control let me say that real quick men your responsibility is to lead men say lead not control i gotta say that out loud because some of us don't understand that we're trying to control people because we don't have control of ourselves can i tell you one of the biggest things i look for in the response of a man is what he does not what he says like what are you doing ah well you know i'ma do this you said that 50 times when you gonna do it let me get out this relationship why are you scared get out now pastor you know i just you know there's just a lot there no just get out well you know i'm working on this space no just get out but you don't know how hard it is like we've been together a long time i get it but get out you're not married well it's hard it's hard because you became one flesh you've got to get out of that space and acknowledge what god is saying is that you are unmarried so you don't need to be one so now i have to repent ask god change some things inside of me husband's role to lead wife's role to be a helper not a slave a helper and not controlling yourself second thing under the present is that you must learn that everyone has somebody say this were expectations come on now do you have expectations when we walk into the role of marriage everyone has expectation i'm who take out the trash who's cooking the broken nature is if you can't cook [Music] you're not gonna kill me mm-hmm i'm gonna kill me i'm a cook here's the reason because we think roles are gender-based so we walk into it saying you know well you know you don't do that and it's like why not yeah real quick don't tell her i said this is this live this one is this camera on listen i i told i told my wife i got 13 years you ain't got none so how how's y'all know so i told my wife and them when i started i planted the sea like i'm gonna throw the trash i take the trash out right if i know how to go i take the trash out i will come home we have a drawer trash i know about that so in the cabinet the trash is in the drawer when i go to open the drawer all kinds of things start falling out because the role is oh you take that trash out i don't take that trash out i said to myself it's overflowing we can't even pick it up out of it why because that's your role here's the problem roles aren't about right and role wrong roles become so much about preference you need to know the difference between preference and the difference between right and wrong your preference is that the bed is made up but it is not right or wrong look at y'all i don't know about that man i don't know i don't know about that bastard like i don't know about that uh oh oh no his clothes are on the floor you like it being nice and neat or her clothes are on the floor and you like it being nice and neat and what happens you get into a what straight up argument if all you would do is just pick up the clothes behind you we would be great you need to turn around and say if all you would do is pick up the clothes we would be great i'm fine with the clothes on the floor it's your problem here's the problem y'all you know you went to their house and you saw them close on the floor and all of a sudden cause marriage hit you think god don't bless me with the gift of cleaning the same gift that i didn't have as a single man is the same gift i ain't got is a merry one we're gonna have to work this thing out but you need to know the difference between the fights that you're having and being able to understand is it preference or is it right and wrong because some of us have made some of the hugest arguments over our preference i just want you to talk last next time you go in the house yelling every time i get in this house anybody know that person that they walk in the house they start assessing every wrong possible look at this i get in this house everything's everywhere everybody over here talk and everybody that's home hears you talking but everybody home has already been home so they know you're not talking to them look at this every time i come in cup sitting there act like nobody can and you just fussing i mean and you got to and by the time you see the actual people that live in the house you have nothing to say to him hey babe how you doing yo how are you doing did you not see the cups in the dishwasher oh gosh oh gosh i've been working all day and you're gonna sit here if you wanted a cleaner you should have inspected in dating to go through their house and say okay you look like a cleaner this is great other than that save your funds and get someone to come clean your home but y'all duking it out every day because of your preference i'm seeing so many marriages listen let me send the cleaning your way so y'all can stop fighting and about to end your marriage and break generational uh uh continuances of of of non-divorce you're about to separate because of clothes a toilet all the petty things that are just somebody say preferences it's not right and wrong it's just it's preferences my question today is have you been creating this image in your mind of what something would be because of your preferences or because you understood you were getting into a relationship you gotta make the determination and the last part under the present is love i want to tell you today love is not enough to sustain a marriage you have to have the skills to do so first corinthians 13 and 7 says this i'm just going to let i'm just going to drop it and then you walk away with it love bears all things toilet seats dirty clothes toothpaste in the sink the heat too high the heat too low 77 in the winter 60 in the summer somebody says it bears all things believes all things hopes all things and endures all things go back to that when you when you want to think about do i want to take this to the next level just ask yourself am i willing to bear believe hope and endure because that's the return on love not the bubbly feeling and the posts jose 4-6 says this my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge i reject you from being a priest meaning an ambassador meaning being a representative to me and since you have forgotten the law of your god i will also forget your children which means that in which you have created will pass down generationally because of your disobedience i want to talk about the post and i want to talk about very quickly divorce and the post of life the bible really gives us clear understanding that divorce is a a choice scripture says in matthew 5 35 but i say to you that everyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of sexual immorality makes her commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery the bible says on earth you're married but in heaven it's declaring you're still together it says because the grounds of divorce are not about i don't like you we're no longer still in love i'm not feeling you if that's where you land don't get married i want to let you know divorce is a choice it's a choice to make the decision to separate as a christian what god has brought together and if you're separated and divorced you've experienced that which so much of our western civilization has you understand that you're going to need more than love to keep your marriage you're going to need the skill set and the forbearing all and enduring all and the hoping all to be able to get through these times the second part of the post is dealing with the pain i want to let you know in divorce there's an uneasing pain that cannot be described there is a i don't care if you're the one initiating i don't care if you're the one the bible says there is such a breakage in the covenant that the covenant is so bonding that when you break it it leaves a mark that only god can heal that's why i will never believe when people come to me and say god said for me to get a divorce it's so unbiblical it's ridiculous that is someone who does not read their bible that is someone that does not have clarity of what god has said god is never telling you to get a divorce it says and at the moment of even think about it i just want to let you know that the only way that you can is through adultery we just don't fit together god says that's not my standard because from the beginning of eaton he never designed marriage to end that's why we say till death do us part it is not a saying it is the idea that when we get married we are together forever somebody tell you god told him no he didn't i'm impressed i'm a said 100 no he didn't it's not biblical it's not in alignment with the word of god and even when adultery occurs you still have to ask god what to do because it's not an automatic passage it's going to be hard to take in i'm okay with it because i'm not creating it god's word is well how can you say that the scripture we just read that's why through the pain of divorce comes so much trauma last but not least the healing somebody say the healing psalms 147 and 3 says this he heals the broken hearted and binds up their wounds only god can heal the heart of divorce only god can reclaim the heart of separation that's why he's very specific even when the pharisees were talking to him he said you know well moses said we could get a certificate of divorce he's like moses only made that so that in order for you to understand the certificate had to come because the certificate meant that you weren't leaving this woman by herself with nothing to have nothing because men were divorcing for any reason and he told him moses only let you do that because of your pride [Music] that's why he allowed it but my standard is that it would never occur how do i know this because christ compares his love and relationship with us to the relationship of the church and him as being marriage he would never break the covenant [Music] that's why corinthians can say love bears all things it endures all things it hopes all things let's stop making divorce an option [Music] and let's start being equipped even before we ever get married to be equipped to see us have the most impactful marriage possible pastor i need more on this let's get into the word of god not your opinion let's get into what god's saying because god's word is to give you the best life possible he said i come that you might have life and have that life to the to the full today i listen it's gonna be one of those messages i'm like that's fine [Music] but why is that so important it's so important because if we don't have the information we can't make the decisions and if we don't have the information to make the decisions then we'll go off of our feelings and our feelings can mess us up in the generations to come and i'm speaking to you today is that god wants you to be healthy whole so when we're talking about marriage we're talking about all of it live the life that god is calling for you to live if you're dating keep it godly not because it's just something to do because when we don't we will see the impact of what it does in our lives today i'm believing that god wants to do something greater than you could ever imagine
