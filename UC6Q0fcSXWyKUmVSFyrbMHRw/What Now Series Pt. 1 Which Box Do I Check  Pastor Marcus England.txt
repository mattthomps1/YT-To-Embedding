make an impact even with our finances he told abraham he said i will bless you so that you can be a blessing god blesses us to be a blessing to others it is never just for ourselves but it is always that the giftings that we have in everything that he is doing we are so grateful that he is doing it in us through us and for us turn and open your bibles to genesis genesis chapter two we're going to hit that scripture uh but we're going to jump into a new series and so i want to thank our musicians our worship team y'all can we give it up for our dream team that's making uh the impact and difference around here come on somebody thank you guys so much i really appreciate you we're we're jumping into what's love month what's black history month we're going to talk about all these things we're going to switch them together bring them back out pour them back out swish them together some more to make sure that we're operating on what god believes is a whole church and we're going after a series entitled what now what now why do we call the series what now because if you can be honest during this pandemic things have changed anybody can be honest that some things have changed during this pandemic there there are things that have altered things that have shifted and i want to say to you is that where do you find yourself right now where have you landed where do you find yourself contemplating some of us we were in the pandemic walked in and we were unmarried some of us walked out and we were married i don't know what happened but some of us walked in with no kids and we walked back out with kids some of us walked in with marriages and we walked back out and unfortunately we did not have them and so the truth of the matter is what happens when life changes uh honestly we had moments in the pandemic as we're still having where there are moments of racial tension that has exploded and continue and it and while there has been some trials that have delivered a a a a a sentence or have given us some clarity the question becomes what now where we are in life what now what are we to do where we are today and so we're going to talk about love we're going to talk about race we're going to talk about culture we're going to talk about the things that the kingdom of god is calling for us to talk about and i'm excited to be able to talk about that today so i entitled today's message which box do i check which box do i check why is that important because when i got married there was a moment where i had to go fill out an application and in the application it asked me am i single or am i married and i'll never forget having to fill that out and i checked that box so happily mary come on y'all there ain't nothing like getting with somebody your boo the one you love your sugar your bae you know that you got going on in life it ain't nothing it ain't nothing like it but then can i tell you there were moments where we we were at the best spot in and and i was filling out an application and i wanted there to be another box that said we'll see later on can i tell you we had some of the moments where it was like i'll check we'll see what it looks like once tonight listen i want to tell you something is that there there is a place where we believe we've arrived to it and and some individuals think that the state of being unmarried is a state of being incomplete and i want to talk to you today about your singleness somebody say singleness i want to talk to you today about your singleness what it looks like to be single what it looks like to be involved in singleness and so i want to start off with asking you some questions here is your ability you can raise your hand or you can respond it is not required but it is available to you we're gonna ask these questions i don't want you to feel pressured but i just want you to internally take this moment the nine o'clock participated i know you're 11 o'clock god has moved in you you've been praying all morning and that's why you got here that'll love it so i know you're more faith-filled than the other group was so i'm gonna ask you these questions and and look for god to speak through you in this moment right now but the first question i have for you is who in here or online is single who in here online is single okay okay cool cool cool all right question number two who in here or online is in an incomplete person without someone else okay okay okay let's let's continue on and i have one more question question number three who and hero online looks talks and thinks like everyone else in the world y'all y'all were big on that first question but everybody got a little quiet on these next two all right so here's what i want to talk about is the puzzling idea behind why you raised your hand to declare your singleness but when i started asking these questions about do you feel complete are you incomplete you said no so the idea is that when i asked are you single you answered the question in your mind he's saying am i unmarried that's the question that you believe that i was asking that's the way you interpreted that am i unmarried because unless you are betrothed you are single you might have a boo you might have a boo online regardless of their destination you are single until you are what the bible says mary and joseph was betrothed or married i know y'all been together for a long time i know y'all been locked in for a while but i'm here to still let you know that if they decide not to show up tomorrow there are no legal ramifications for those of you who are single if you go to court and say we've been doing it for five years the judge is gonna say i'm sorry but that's not a legal contrary so when we think about this idea of single singleness is not brokenness singleness is not brokenness the world has tried to define singleness as a state of being broke or disconnected or the idea that no one wants you or the idea that you aren't fit for other people and here is the questions that i really want to connect with you if i asked you how many sing unmarried people are whole how many of you would raise your hand that went down a little bit i'm concerned single people you went down i was like are you whole my question to single people are you unique how many of you would say that okay great great great great great you went up there we went up we we went up amen jesus how how many married people will say you are whole come on mary folk don't look at your spouse their hand might not be raised i can ask real quick how many married people are unique so what if the definition of being single was the definition of being separate whole and unique what if singleness was not defined to the level of your marriage status but singleness was the collective idea that i am separate i am whole and i am unique the difference in the status is that the idea is that you are married or what unmarried if you're married today i want to let you know you have not canceled out the place where you are still separate unique and whole you did not lose your wholeness you did not use you lose your uniqueness and you did not lose being separate i don't care how much you love one another one of you wakes up separately than the other one does i don't care how much you love one another your air is not my heir i don't care how much you declare that without you i cannot breathe i promise you without you i shall breathe [Music] now you may feel winded but you can breathe the context level that we have made the idea is that marriage is no longer singleness and singleness is all about being broken jacked up pulled apart from everyone else and now you have a state of singleness that you don't know how to operate so you need someone else to make you complete i want to let you know today that in your singleness you are complete right where you are y'all would say well i mean maybe i mean you know i could use somebody are we going there pastor because if not he's looking right at me and i don't want him seeing me clap too much you know what i mean let's stop defining singleness as unmarried let's start defining singleness as i'm separate i'm whole and i'm unique which means the idea that all of us need to continue to work on our singleness is so important because the individual that god created was not contingent upon the person that you made the decision to connect with let me tell you where this will shake it up in a married couple with an individual who in themself is insecure about the level of who they are and attachment equals love and the idea that being separate yet being joined as one is such a fear that you lose your purpose in who you are called to be to exercise your purpose and who someone else says you are when someone asks me where's your better half your response should be you mean my better hole i don't have a half i didn't get with half of a person i didn't marry an incomplete individual who did not have a destiny and a plan that god had already set over their life i did not marry halves to bring together a half i've married a whole to bring together a whole so that god could do something in two whole individuals so your singleness is not an issue of you being unmarried your singleness is the definition that god has created me with a purpose a destiny and has defined my life before someone else can when i recognize that god has called me to a state of singleness from my entirety i recognize that my purpose always falls and lies in who he says i am not what someone declares is actually me so for the single individual that has been searching for so long for someone to see what's inside of them and to affirm what they see with the conclusion of connecting with them i want to free you today because you're already whole by yourself whether you're married or unmarried [Music] can we go to scripture real quick because somebody is yelling in their spirit blasphemy there's a single person yelling out right now blasphemy he's speaking against my my man or my woman that god is sending me and i'm here today to let you know god has already prepared a direction for your life that if it is connected with someone it can enhance but it does not make genesis chapter 2 creation let's start there verse 15. and the bible says this and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to do what work it and keep it say it with me work it and keep it god had given man assignment before there was any eve to take place before there was any need for him to arise god had already established purpose before there was a a sense of children before there was a sense of any other responsibility i want to let you know in this world that god gives you purpose before he gives you responsibility i'll establish purpose in the man and i'll give them responsibility verse 18 jumps and says then the lord god said it is not good that man it is not good the lord god said it is not good that man should be what alone somebody say alone he did not say it is not good that man should be married he did not say what you need in order to complete your life is another individual what he said it's not good that man should be alone i will make him a what helper somebody say help her not your everything he says i will make him a helper fit for him now out of the ground the lord god had formed what every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to man to see what he would call them and whatever the man called every living creature that was its name the man gave names to all livestock to the birds of the heavens and every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a helper fit for him real quick let's go back into the text god says it's not good that man should be alone what does adam say nothing because adam didn't even notice he was alone because he was in his purpose doing what god had called him to do isn't it funny that you only notice the things you do not have when you're in the state of doing less than what you're supposed to be doing when you're grinding right let's just do some earthly terms when you're grinding to get the money you don't notice about the money you just don't have why because you understand what you're doing currently is to bring forth what you want to see exist the idea that i want you to have is that in your singleness in the moment of living your life when you are so preoccupied with the purpose and destiny that god has called you to you stop recognizing your deficiencies every time you're alone because your aloneness is different than your singleness see the your aloneness makes you want to find somebody for netflix because you're tired of watching it by yourself but your singleness says i wouldn't want to watch it with the wrong person anyway see most of the times our singleness is going against our loneliness the whole individual of who we are the separate the whole unique individual is fighting the desires that lie within every human person which says there is a loneliness in me that i want it to be fulfilled that i want it to happen but what i understand is there is fulfilling loneliness and there is fulfilling the status of being married and unmarried and marrying does not complete your loneliness can i tell you that now single people because you can absolutely be with someone and be as lonely as you have ever been before y'all like no you can't i'm like yes you can and you can be by yourself and be just as fulfilled as anyone else can i tell you that god wants singleness out of you but he doesn't want loneliness that's why the bible says he created eve so that he wouldn't be alone god looks and says ah it's not good you'd be alone here's what our reply is to god well then lord give me a man well then lord give me a woman give me a bae give me a boo god said oh lord jesus says that to himself he's talking to the the trinity y'all didn't get it just forget it just talking with them oh my goodness and so you go searching for what you believe fills the void that will bring the wholeness not understanding that you can have moments of loneliness and still be complete thank you i appreciate it single people in here like this is blasphemy i'm gonna get me a man i'm gonna get me a woman saw somebody shut that bible nope this is heresy no i'm not doing this i've been praying for this for five years i've fasted for 22 days i'm just an expectation of what god's about to do exceeding abundantly i said well we'll see let's see we'll see what god does there the idea that we have traveled around is that we're incomplete because we're unmarried it's a broken mindset and a broken way of thinking and anyone who comes to you with the idea that they can complete you has a sense of a problematic area in their life because if they understood who they were they would understand their completeness cannot be connected with another incomplete person to complete them because no one else completed them but only god so today i want you to understand that all of us are striving for singleness to be somebody say complete you got to be complete you got to be whole you got to be unique in knowing who you are not forming yourself image wise to fit the idea of what someone else will think right because single people you have a list y'all know y'all list come on single people don't don't like y'all know y'all list what's on your list what have you said absolutely i'm not doing like what's what's your list that you identified as the needed pieces in order to have someone live out life with you that you made a decision like if this ain't happening i ain't doing it what's what's the height requirement what what's the complexion requirement how many zeros can i tell you the population of men is starting to stand up for ourselves the single brothers in the in the house and while y'all looking for a number i want to see a number y'all want don't want me back out there i would be bursting people but let me know let me see your bank account where's your savings at well you know i'm just looking for uh i'm here taking nobody ain't nobody sugar daddy i ain't here to be doing this because i need you to be complete in your finances like i'm complete in mines then when you get together you're angry because they got bills and jacked up finances that you like you ain't never tell me about this that's because you weren't worried about them being complete you was worried about them being six foot two no no that's not good no we're not we're not gonna do that i'm just saying charles because a married person will tell you that sweetheart why you are gorgeous and sir while you are swole with 18 abs i mean you are the right complexion right height when life begins to really happen your height complexion and cuteness go out the window here's why i don't like teaching relationship series let me tell you why i try to stay away from them because people in relationships become the most defensive that ain't us that ain't us and i'm i'm only i'm not talking to the people who are talking i'm only talking to the people who are talking talking let me give you real quick the stages of your singleness there is by yourself there is talking there is talking talking there's engaged there's betrothed there's marriage there's a lot of statements in there of what life looks like why because the idea is that you grow an understanding of each other not in feeling can i tell somebody single before you go date somebody else again that stop being so concerned about how bubbly you feel in the moment and start asking some complete questions that help you to identify what god would fit and see fit to give you as a what partner what god would introduce into your life and stop getting frustrated at me because i can't make them who you want them to be so you can be beyonce and jay-z and that brother and sister ain't got no intentions of being nobody's beyonce or jay-z because marriage doesn't fix it us us but it doesn't fix us and if we are not working on our singleness being separate whole and unique in god then what we are getting is an incomplete individual who we are hoping will turn out to all of the things that have been ticking in our wonderful minds of who that special person was going to turn on and be so let's talk about which box you're going check let's talk about where you're really going to find yourself being because now you're understanding your singleness is not a curse your singleness is not a a response from god that you don't deserve the bible says that god had to create eve to be fit for adam yet and still eve jacked up the process so if god created eve customizer and no other choice yet she still made her own decision on what she would do then what in the world do you have in your mind going on to think that you can change somebody when god customized eve and adam couldn't even change her no i like i love talking to single colors no because once i get them i'm just going to form them up what are you are you the are you the potter all i gotta do is just and once i get him he go and and we we we start taking on god's job in people's lives so they start looking like we want them to look but the problem is you are never supposed to connect with someone that was identical to what you wanted you were supposed to connect with someone that god had for what you need a helper need and you'll never determine it if you're trying to change what people look like so point number one i want you to do this i want i i want you to do this love your status you're unmarried love where you are stop seeing it as a curse something that god didn't do some answer that god didn't give you stop seeing where you are as a broken stage if you're married stop seeing where you are as god oh my why would you send this person god says wait first of all you you're not going to blame me for that choice because i want to expel this myth that god is going to sing you a person out of the 7.9 billion people that live in this world that god is going to uniquely strategize so that you and the person he created for you line up together to meet at a certain point and god is more concerned about your marital status than your salvation for the bible says he said i wish that none would perish but that all will come into what repentance so let me clarify this for you god does not impose on you his will unless you accept it so he's not forcing you and sending you a person he's introducing people to you for you to make a decision eve was not forced on adam adam took eve to be his wife i want to let you know today why you love that person you're with god did not tell you that's the one the lord showed me no he didn't what the lord gonna show you is your brokenness not your marital upgrade that's hard y'all because we have the tendency that to believe that god is more concerned about what we want than what he wants for us what he wants for us is salvation so if god would impose any kind of will it would be that you be saved if he didn't impose that on you he's not going to impose a marital person to be your spouse why because if god gave you the person he has to take the responsibility for when things go wrong and god does not fail i'm good with golf claps today i'm good with them all right y'all i listen i know how relationship series look they'd be like you know god told me this was my mate no no no no because you questioned whether your mate when y'all were in that argument last week excuse me i'm just i'm just excuse me i thought that was funny let me let me read the bible verse to get serious first corinthians chapter 7 verse 17 it says this and don't be wishing you were some where someplace else or with someone else it says where you are right now is god's place for you live and obey and love and believe right there god not your marital status defines your life yeah like that's the message i don't believe it single people your heart i'm trying to tell y'all the unmarried people they don't play you got another one what else you got [Music] cause god told me that one was mine i'll just say okay point number two after you love your status here's what you have to do fill your life with meaningful relationships he said it's not good that man be alone did not say the problem to man's aloneness was marriage the answer to loneliness is relationships and they are all need to be romantic of the opposite sex and a people that can do something only for you in exchange for what you feel for them i'm here today to let you know you're called to fill your life with meaningful relationships my question today is the only meaningful relationship you have is the ones that you date can can i say this to somebody you can spend so much time searching for what you want that you have no time to be who you are all of your days are spending looking for complete and wholeness when god is already saying you are complete and whole right where you are somebody got to tell themselves real quick i'm good you got you got you guys say that thing with some confidence where you at i'm good if somebody comes in let's do this but if nobody does i'm good i feel like some of you are rebuking me like peter did jesus don't say that don't that's not good lord no you are good where you are and if god brings another whole individual in your life to walk out this life with then guess what you're good i'm good then too but i don't get good when i feel that god has lifted this space of unmarital what we call bliss into a marital bliss and god is saying nope you're good right where you are i i would love if you're in a relationship if you're married to tell a person beside you you ain't gonna do it right now but tell a person i just want to let you know i'm whole they might look at you with the side eye like maybe but wait if you knew you were holding the person beside you you will hold maybe they would get their stuff together because they understood you were a whole individual without them and they need to be a whole individual just in case you got into something that was 50 50. the question today is do you actually believe you're whole or do you believe your wholeness is defined in someone else today you can go ahead write that down just figure out am i in my whole by myself or in my whole when i'm with somebody because if i feel the sense of wholeness when i'm with someone then my wholeness is determined not on god but on the occupancy of space in my life and so it means there's an empty space in me that i actually have to work out so that i don't find myself manipulating people manipulating people who i know don't feel wholeness to draw them into me so that i now have meaning through their lack of wholeness are you good by yourself some of y'all don't know because you haven't given your space in your life to actually know who you are everybody in here has a different name everybody in here has a different fingerprint our dna is different yet we're trying to find somebody the same and it doesn't make sense because god didn't call for you to get a duplicate god called for you to get someone that would be a somebody say help her ecclesiastes 4 9-10 says this you're better off to have a friend somebody say friend so that's that's not even talking or talking talking let me clarify this a friend somebody say friend because the term friend has changed for some of you are we going we're not going to be honest around here i will actually single ladies in my church so uh what's going on in your life oh i just got friends what what do we we we first of all how many uh do you have because what i don't need you doing is juggling friendships like you're in the circus so let's pull that in and let's figure out what are these friendships for are they for your singleness or your loneliness he said you're better off to have a friend to be all alone because then you will get more enjoyment out of what what you earn pause let me help y'all single folk real quick the freedom that you have in your singleness pastor i'm free in my marriage no you're not somebody's watching you um the freedom you have in your singleness to do what you want when you want how you want the way you want is different than when you're married because when you're married you got to give an explanation because there's a sense of accountability and that sense of accountability is if you got up at 3am in the morning and started your car being married and just peeled out somebody is going to get a call or you will have a individual running behind your car or you will have an apb out on your car because you did not give clarity to where you were going why is that important because you are now connected with someone when you are married and there is accountability system that goes to it let me tell you something single people if you want to get up in the middle of the night and go drag race in the middle of the street guess who you have to give an account to nobody i gotta ask my wife is it cool if i go and do some donuts uh no not tonight okay i just was checking hey guys i can't come out tonight but call me next week i'll see what's happening single people if you want to start working in the middle of the night if you if you want to do whatever guess what you can do you can do what you want guess what when you spin something out of your account there is no one else that has a login that can see where did this 995 go it says yo the bible says you'll get more enjoyment out of what you earn some of y'all ain't enjoying your money in a long time hey hey where's that going put that back put that back won't be no spending today you oh my gosh [Music] you're not lonely no more but you ain't got no money no more either scripture says it you'll get more enjoyment out of what you earn i'm still asking can i buy laffy taffies is it all right if i get two [Laughter] it says if you fall guess what your friend can help you up but if you fall without having a friend nearby you're really in trouble it's saying that the the context to your loneliness is not about a spouse it's about having people in your life that are meaningful relationships that can help you walk through your life to experience the freedom that god has for you and it's not about the relationship being intimate it's about it being meaningful we got to notice the difference between meaningful intimate desirable we've defined and just clicked it all in one well if i just get one person that understands it all that should be good but the third thing i want you to be able to do is this is our last thing which is i want you to pursue singleness we've already defined that singleness is the state of being separate whole and unique being complete in who you are even if you are joined together with someone else i know who i am i know where i'm going i know what god has spoken over my life i know that i'm seeking him for myself my husband isn't seeking him for me and my wife isn't seeking him for me i am seeking the lord for myself because i know what it is that he is saying and then what's happening we're coming into somebody say agreement when when god gives you someone when i say gives you meaning introduces and you make this decision for yourself that this is the person that you want to be with god says i can bring agreement in these people here's another thing i want to throw at you real quick god can only be at the center of a christian marriage he cannot be the center in people he isn't in christians marry through god unbelievers marry through man let me clarify that you can't say i got married in a church and god's over my marriage it's absolutely not true because god cannot be in something that he's not in and if god his holy spirit is not in us then how can he be in it if he's not in you god can't be in something that has rejected him god's in our marriage how if he's not in you scripture in matthew 6 33 says this but first and most importantly seek amen strive after his kingdom and his righteousness his way of doing and being right not your way his way in your relationship his way not your way to get to know each other so we gotta we gotta come together and live together so we know it's right no the bible says seek his kingdom his righteousness his way of doing it and being right it says the attitude and character of god and all these things will be given to you also pastor what are you preaching i'm preaching that god has to be in it for god to bless it i don't care how happy you are saying you are i don't care how much you're saying this person is completing me i want to let you know your completion comes through jesus christ and number two i want to let you know that god is in something that somebody has let him be in i want to give you another christianity another doctrine to satisfy where you are and to satisfy what you want to hear because what it will end in is a broken relationship that's so disconnected from god because you thought the ceremony was god's approval and god's approval was entry into your heart and into your life that's why the bible says don't be unevenly yoked why because the fact of the matter is that how can god enter in he says if this is pre-marriage and you marry someone that does not know god or is disconnected from god and you're saying god be in this marriage and you're counseling people be in this marriage and you're telling folk god's through this marriage i'm here today to tell you that that's false because god cannot be in what something that someone hasn't allowed him to be in check your word the clarity of what god is speaking is to us as people so we stop having false expectations of what god can do because a person that's unsubmitted to god with the person that submitted to god brings that god can move in one but can't move in the other and you believe that god's going to force his will to change someone when he won't today i want to give you the truth of what now what now where you are where now that you're in your singleness what now that you're at a pivotal point in the relationship where you're making the decision of what's the next step what now what now is to ask god lord i want to make sure i'm complete so that when i get to the next stage i'm meeting another complete person because complete people see other complete people why because i know what process looks like i believe today that god is spoken in our hearts to know which box to check not the box that just somebody looks good not the box that they meet the height requirement not the box that they met the figure requirement but the box that god is in this and when god is in it god can move through it today which box will you check let's
