so are you tell your third choice i'm sorry you're my third choice but i'm a world changer and so are you so let's get cracking in the word of god luke chapter two we're going to start at verse 41. we're going to talk about jesus i think he's a good subject to talk about preach something we preach jesus the bible says his meaning jesus his parents went to jerusalem verse 41 of luke chapter two and says every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem according to the custom of the feast now when they had finished the days as they returned it said the boy jesus and luke is being respectful in using this word it says he lingered we're going to come back to that word a choice of verbiage he lingered behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother did not know it we're going to talk about their parenting skills as well but supposing him to happen in the company they went a day's journey a day's journey and sought him among their relatives and acquaintances so they did not find him they returned to jerusalem seeking him now so it was after three days somebody say three days it's something about jesus in him three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both listening to them and asking them questions and all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers it says so when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said to him son why have you done this to us look at your father and i have sought you anxiously if he could have been god in that moment acting he'd have said there's a scripture that's going to tell you be anxious for nothing but he didn't act that way he just went ahead and heard what they were saying it says and he said to them why did you seek me jesus watch your tone all right watch your tongue you you get a little out of pocket we're here to find you so we're trying to figure out what's going on why did you seek me did you not know that i must be about my father's business but they did not understand the statement which he spoke to them then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject to them or he was obedient to them but his mother kept all these things in her heart last verse 52 and says and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men the title of the message that i want to speak from today in our series lessons week number 72. the title is the time has come just tell your neighbor the time has come tell your other neighbor the time has come tell your third choice third choice your time has come let's pray father in the name of jesus we understand the time has come and we don't want to sit waiting but we want to move according to your word today help us not to walk according to what we see but help us to walk according to the faith of what you've spoken inside of us we need you today not to just be hearers of your word but also to be doers appliers of that in which you speak for we love you honor and thank you in jesus name we all say amen amen thank you musicians you guys killed i can say that amen y'all killed it today um i always want to celebrate to our dream team that is here making everything happen can we celebrate the dream team that's a part today thank you for every volunteer every person that's been a part we so so celebrate you so let's talk about this moment in luke chapter 2. now i i want to take it from a frame of reference if you were really judging if you saw this story and you didn't know who the main character was you will have judgment it's jesus so you give him grace and everybody around him the problem is if you read this tomorrow on instagram you would have some comments in the comment section jesus the one born in bethlehem in the pig trough i remember this boy i remember him from 12 years ago his mother in them not mother his mother it's muba his mother and father had him in a pig trough in an eating in a food feeding manger he was raised around animals strange men came offering gifts people were looking at him from afar off you remember him i remember him if i go back into my story line i remember him if i tagged him i remember him guess what what girl they lost him well sounds right they were a little off anyway right they went to the festival they go every year jesus finds himself at the place where he is at the festival of the passover and people are about to leave his parents and everyone is going back to their hometown and the bible says jesus lingered let's be honest jesus decided i'm not going back jesus lingers behind so we have some counseling that jesus needs because he seems a little bit disobedient and rebellious don't talk about my jesus like this i'm just telling you if you read this story on instagram or on the story line and you didn't know it was jesus you would have a different opinion but here's where you would get really judgmental and the parents left for a day and didn't know that jesus was missing can i tell you he had to be a teenager because there was limited conversation from parent to child that's what teenagers find themselves at places sometimes it's limited they didn't talk to jesus for a whole day until they notice all right jesus come out your room put down the ps45 and let's get together and eat anybody seeing jesus i ain't seeing jesus you seeing jesus i ain't seeing jesus you you wait did y'all not count him in no we counted but then we lost count and we just figured he was a part of the crew i'm not sure if you've ever watched the movie home alone but the whole context is there's so many kids that kevin gets left behind because nobody actually really paid attention to that kevin was missing here's my problem it's a little different you lost the son of god you lost our messiah our savior is missing what do we do you better go back and find them if i'd have been a part of that karate said that you better go back and find them you are missing our savior the bible says they search for it they can't find them they've got to go back to jerusalem it takes them three days to find jesus we're at a total of four days of a missing child there's no amber alert there's a ruth alert i don't know they didn't have amber back then i don't think that name was popular and they put out the squad we just want to let you know missing child last seen jerusalem a whole bunch of people there i don't know where we left them last and you know if you ever look at an ambler it leaves what kind of vehicle and stuff like that if you see it call it in donkey brown carriage behind it whole lot of kids if you see it report it because here's why you got to report it mary and joseph had they been living in america would find themselves in the place where cps would be knocking on their door so you're trying to tell me you lost your son the son that we already have been questioning that you raised in a barn and you've lost him and you didn't even know you lost him and now it's four days later and you're just finding him when you get them we're going to take them and then we're going to rush you and if you got any other kids we taking them too they're gone this is the story how we would read it today the bible says they get to jesus and they're anxious jesus how could you do this what what in the world how could you oh my goodness what are you doing jesus in reply says why did you seek me y'all know let's be honest y'all know after been missing for four days you're a little tight with the tongue i find you i'm crying i'm anxious cps gonna take you and your response to me is why do you seek me because i'm reading the text i can add my emphasis where i would like why are you seeking me don't you know i'm about my father's business jesus had purpose somebody say purpose oh we hear that word so much it's it's it's interesting to talk about that jesus had purpose and in that purpose he was fulfilling it but the problem with purpose is that purpose doesn't always fit everyone's schedule purpose requires things to look different purpose requires you to live a different kind of way to wake up at a different kind of time to to to move about in a different kind of realm i want to let you know purpose today puts you in a different position than everyone else purpose today says i'm going to do something live a kind of way be in a different kind of flow than other people are purpose says that i'm going to do some things that even the closest people to me won't understand because i've been called with somebody's a purpose have you been called with purpose yes you have if you are if you are created the bible says you are made in the image and likeness of god i want to let you know today is that you have purpose the thing about your purposes is your purpose will take some time to develop it's got to grow out of you you've got to be intentional about the way in which you you put yourself in position to fulfill the purpose here's what i want to let you know today is that jesus was in the temple learning from those in whom were greater and older than him and the bible says he was there listening sitting and asking questions because your purpose is going to require you to learn some things that you don't know the problem with our world is everybody knows everything everybody has information about everything everybody knows what to do what to do how to do it the best way to do it we all have google we all have the ability to look it up and find and answer the problem that we often times find is that we're not willing to sit and listen sit and listen can i sit and listen and ask questions sit and listen and ask questions and then the bible turns around and says that they are what amazed why are they amazed because of jesus's answers his understanding and his answers his understanding and his answers my question today is that understanding produces answers clarity produces answers understanding a purpose where you're going how you live what god has called you to do produces answers for how you manage your life my question today is do you understand where your life is going because if you do you'll manage your life in that kind of way the biggest thing that we have the ability to waste is time anybody know how to waste some time anybody get up in the morning and have no clue what you'd be doing and and you find yourself rushing when you got up in extra time anybody ever been there before i mean you're just fiddling and darling you singing i'm singing praising to the lord you're worshiping you're crying you're getting dressed today is just wonderful lord i bless you then you look at your clock you 10 minutes behind the lord said i didn't do that i knew he was worshipping me but i didn't do that i know he was in praise to me i didn't do that my question today is do you know how to manage the time that god has given you because the kingdom principle of management is not only with resources it's where somebody say time my question to you would be today is did you manage the wheat that just passed by properly did you give time to god did you give time to your spouse did you give time to your family did you give time to growth did you give time to learning did you give time to yourself how did you manage your time and what was the stipulations for the management of your time the question that i'm raising that you've got to be able to understand is i believe the time has come but you've got to know your timing you got to know where you're going you got to know how to manage it you got to know where to put it it's a kingdom principle why because we don't waste because we understand the moments the days our lives are limited can i bear witness to you that jesus knew about time if we went back to john chapter 2 remember jesus at the wedding we were talking about that last week and jesus is at the wedding and the bible says they're having a good time but after they're having a good time what happens the wine runs out anybody know about the wine runner no you shouldn't know about the wine running out it says the wine ran out and jesus mother comes to him and she says jesus the wines run out the the wedding is going to be affected by us it's not that just the party's going to be over it's going to embarrass this couple it's it's going to speak to what they don't have can you help this moment and jesus saying jesus that reply back why do you seek me should have been a pop there the problem is i'm going to go right here on the discord when you don't discipline them the first time it happens again then jesus comes back and says woman no i'm just playing that's not the right interpretation of it i just want to i just no i'm just playing i'm just playing i'm just playing i was just looking like no no that's not it's not an offensive woman just to be okay but the way i read the text everybody know like when you read a text and you read it with your personality on there and you'll be adding all that sauce woman wait what is jesus disrespectful no he says woman my time has not come yet my question is do you know your timing do you know the rhythm do you know what you're supposed to be doing it and when you're supposed to be doing do you understand the difference between the season and which god is providing in the season that god is calling for you to possess i want to know do you understand time we have another moment where where where jesus is in the garden of gethsemane you remember it and and he's crying and and he's finding himself in the place where there is blood that is almost coming out of him the bible says the sweat is like blood and and he's so messed up but he says lord not my will be done your will be done once he comes out of the garden he looks at the disciples and says you know what just go ahead and go to y'all didn't stay up with me anyway he says but i want to let you know the end has come the time has come i'm interested today do you understand the principle of time here's what i want to let you know about time is that time is a commodity that is given to each and every one of us equally it is the one thing that all of us get the same of whether i have money or i don't have money where whether whether i'm tall or i'm short whether whether whether i'm i'm big or i'm small uh whether i'm light or i'm darker or whether it doesn't matter where i am can i tell you this very clearly each of us has 24 hours in the day and what we do with the 24 hours will be a big impact on the result that we see within our life the 24 hours that you're given i'm interested what are you doing with them how are you planning how are you situating your life how are you looking at what you're doing if if you find yourself in a place where time anybody ever heard this phrase tom is getting away from me anybody ever had time get away from him you somewhere you're supposed to be doing something and time does what get away from you tom finds itself shifting into another place i was supposed to be any i know all of us have found ourselves here before but anybody know you were only supposed to watch one episode y'all know how that's how i started anybody remember that i'm just gonna watch what one anybody know that everything starts with a promise to oneself of one that's how it starts one donut one episode just one more piece of candy it's just one but one multiplies the two and you know how we go from there now we're on season 11. it's five o'clock in the morning and we're just staring there like it's over what do you mean it's over your life cause that's what you just watched away your life anybody ever been there you got addicted didn't know it was gonna be that good i think one of the things we don't understand is that the enemy can't convince all of us of sin but he's good enough to distract us from what we need to do and the sin of distraction is giving way to something you were never supposed to be doing here's what i want to let you know if you don't have something managing your time your time will manage you and you'll watch yourself react as moments take place can i tell you today i don't think we recognize how fleeting time is it's already the middle of the day and you just woke up not too long ago the bible says in psalm 90 and 12 it says help us to remember that our days are what numbered and help us to interpret our lives correctly what i want you to get into is that every moment of your life has meaning and purpose and what you do with it will define the return on investment that you see into what you put in anybody know back in the day a song come out you learn it now what's happening as well is that when you put your time into learning a song you start to like it and it comes on the radio and you start rapping and you start singing and you can go down all the lyrics anybody ever been there before and you start going through it and you just you start looking like yeah yeah yeah and you start flowing and it's like how do you know that oh i listen to this song every day anything that you put into yourself you will get a return on investment in my question today is what are you sowing into that's producing the return on investment that you want to see what are you producing out of your life that you put something into earlier are you good with knowing what's happening with the housewives of potomac or are you producing a conversation in relationships that are connected to where you're going not what just happening in this world i'm interested to find out from you how are you using your time write this question down how am i deciding to use my time what am i what am i doing how am i managing it is it a kingdom principle yes because everything that god gives us is a resource to be used for his glory it's not only about the money that i have it's not only about the car that i drive it's not only about the house that i own it has everything to do with everything is from god so my time is from god what am i doing with my time today man we just free winging it whatever it goes so if you free wing the rest of your day what's your monday going to look like you get me what happens is whatever i plan for happens i want my monday to be changed and look different then i've got a plan for my monday to be the way that i'm seeing it be if i wake up in the morning and just say uh we'll see what happens holy spirit leave me holy spirit said first of all you haven't even talked to me so all the things that you're expecting me to do we don't even have time to talk about what to do how to react what's the way to do it and god is saying today if you manage your time properly you can find yourself seeing the results of what you want to see instead of using the wish factor in the rest of your life i wish anybody know how that works i wish wish i had more money wish things were further wish i was healthier which the relationship was better here's the problem you don't need to wish it can happen if you use your time properly my question today what is in your time that's taking up schedule that you never plan for that isn't producing anything and then who do you need to yell at you to yank you out of it anybody know you need some people to yell at like i don't care how good you are at life you need some folk to just jump kick you drop you a clothesline you out of the moment what you doing man just sitting here watching a little something man get your lazy tail up here's the problem you told me you had goals you shouldn't have told me you shouldn't have told me that you were trying to go somewhere you shouldn't have told me that you had a plan or vision or a hope of where god wanted to take you you shouldn't have told me because since you told me now the responsibility in my head is to help you get there i'm just connected to you that kind of way and so because i believe it's a part of my responsibility the question is is have you allowed people in your life that you told your goals to that are holding you accountable here's a good question you go to somebody and say man listen my marriage is bad right now ah here's a quick question how's the time i mean we try to get together in between when i can okay cool real quick if you put the time into it you'll see the return on the investment pastor i had tried to put the time that doesn't look the way and everything don't fall out the way that you think it is here's what i'm telling you if you put the time it'll work out it'll work out for the marriage no maybe it won't work out for the marriage but there will be growth that you have done so that when things do happen you put yourself in position and say i did all that i could to make it be everything it should have been the question is how are you using your time i think this how i spend my time is a response of my level of expectancy so what's your expectation for life what's your expectation for you to be in five years what's your expectation for what god's going to do inside your life the way that you expect is the way that you sow the way that you expect is the way that you create in time management so if i'm expecting y'all remember that song i'm looking for a miracle you remember that you ever heard that may not have heard it okay it's cool i just introduced you to it all right you're looking for a miracle great anybody need a miracle can somebody be honest anybody need a miracle i need a miracle y'all need one i need one amen i need a miracle great how much time you spending with god to get it i think i mean i think he just knew so i figured if he knew he would just do it oh you're not willing to invest the time into the relationship with god but you're looking to reap the miracle you you want the blessing you want the house to open up you you want the husband you you want the promotion you just don't want to spend the time with god got it just asking because i'm interested in your mind of what you think is a product of what you do so if you think god owes me a miracle then you operate at the level that god says you know what i'm going to wait for you to act and you're saying on the other side no god i think you owe me and act yourself do for me and i'll come for you and god says that's not how this thing works so the context is how do i manage my time here's what i believe god works with decisions and desires do you have a decision and has it created a desire my decision is this i'm going to follow god to where he's called me all throughout scripture god has led people with vision he has spoken to them of clarity of where they're going abraham go i'm gonna make you a father over many nations go into the land called canaan leave your family and go all right moses go and free my people all right david go and learn and grow and become king all right jesus go and deliver my people from their sins got it if you got any other way i mean i'll go for it now my will but your all right cool paul go peter go it's time for you to go and the bible lets us know that everyone has to have a decision and that's decision brings about a desire here's what scripture says in psalms 21 verse 2 it says you have granted him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips i'm here today to let you know that god wants to act upon your decision and your desires but the decision that you make will be out of response to understanding that the desires that are on your heart come from god and god alone so the clarity of today is have you made a decision and is a decision driving your desires have you made a decision where you're going what you're going to do who you going to serve if y'all remember the scripture lets us know in daniel there were three hebrew boys they were standing before a great king king nebuchadnezzar and he says listen i need you to bow when you hear the sound everyone bows to the golden image problem is when you've made a decision a decision your desires are to whatever that decision is i need you to vote can't do it king you ever disrespected somebody respectfully that's what happened that's a disrespectful respect can't bow king king can do it why we've already made this decision to follow the one true and living god so it means our desire is to him not our own will a decision keeps you focused not on what you want but on what you need i made a decision i was going to get healthy so i'm focusing my desires on the need not the want our question today is what have you decided what have you decided with god what what did you and god come to a conclusion with god the days that i have that are number i'm going to spend them being free and happy god says i'm not sure that was the purpose that i called you to there's joy in it but i would have never wrote the scripture that i'll provide peace even where it doesn't seem like it makes sense because if so if my job was to live out every day feeling great and feeling perfect you would never have understood the pain that i go through myself see jesus is trying to make sure you understand he said if if i went through it why don't you think you would go through it today i'm trying to figure out are you willing to walk through the pain to see the product of what god has for your life well is it the pain always no does it feel like it maybe sometimes but the reward of what you see is what we saw in scripture last week which says well done thy good and faithful servant which means i was being obedient to something other than my desires point number one i want to establish for you how to manage the time god has given you so some of us aren't just wasting time around we just aren't living day to day trying to figure out what we're going to do here's what i also want to keep you from is being religious in the way you live your life because you have a good schedule does it mean you have a destined outcome can i tell you some of us are regimented but we still don't have an expectation we're good i'm on it praying every morning pastor you can't come at me can't come for me i'm in my word i'm reading great what has god said haven't heard him in a long time possibility that your regiment isn't about your purpose your regiment has become religion and it's enough to make you feel good about you the problem is it's not producing results you ever seen somebody say i go to the gym all the time and you don't want to be judgmental but you just like all the time every day every day here's what you're saying you could be telling the truth but you're doing something to escape the results of what being in the gym every day will produce you can go to the gym every day but if you eat a pizza every day all of what you did in the gym won't make any difference because you'll never see the results because you weren't doing what needed to be done how do i manage what god's given to me first thing i need you to do is plan your day according to your purpose not your comfort plan your day according to your purpose not your comfort what's the purpose what are we going to do today oh we just gonna didn't we have things we wanted to do places god called for us to go is it gonna be a little uneasy sometimes yes yes because the difference with god is god is not in the miracle business because you're too lazy to do god wants to provide you needs for your needs that you don't have the ability to provide for yourself not for the needs that are pre-existing where you are that you don't have the time or you don't have the management skill to be able to use properly to get the results from what you need god's not interested in giving you a raise when you can't handle what you're using now god's not interested in doing more god if i just had a couple more hours in the day no you haven't decided the difference between what's urgent and what's important because for us everything that is urgent is important anybody know how that feel oh my gosh i gotta go and do i gotta go and be i gotta go and see it's like no that's not urgent anybody think about something and immediately you go to amazon oh i'm the only one ain't nobody been there you know how i go i need a charger and it's the first thing you go do even if you are in the middle of something else you will break hold on real quick let me order this charger before i what forget the problem is the difference in understanding the urgency of it and what's important separates you from even thinking about should i be buying this is there another one somewhere else and anybody ever been there you bought it and then you go back and you find 17 chargers got to charge it in the car charger in the bathroom charger in the kitchen everywhere i go there's a charger because god forbid my phone died ephesians says this i want you to read this with me 5-13 it says whatever the revelation light exposes it will also correct and everything that reveals truth is light to the soul this is why the scripture says arise you sleeper rise from your coffin and the anointed one will shine his light into you so be very careful how you live not being like those with no understanding but live somebody say honorably with true wisdom for we are living in evil times verse 16 so take full advantage of every day as you spend your life for his purposes it's the word of god my question today is how are you spending your time for the person i want to let the young person know right now if you're young in here now is the opportunity to get it together you can do whatever you want but those of us that are double digits has begin to increase some of us may be close to triple what i want to say to you is that it's not too late but i also speak this to you is that you have to wake up let's tell your neighbor real quick wake up it could be sleep and i might have just did that to wake a couple people up but i'm here today it says wake up oh sleeper what god is willing to do for those of us that said i didn't have the same beginning as everybody i didn't have the same moments as everybody god says i'm willing to redeem the time but when i redeem the time you have to use it somebody say wisely some of you god has brought enlightenment in this season of your life and the enlightenment means that you've got to do and make some decisions that you have to gain up on the time that you lost some of us are in the season of enlightenment where god says i'm going to redeem the time you say god great what i got to do shut off everything and spend time with me you're like ah you don't understand it's your next chance it says wake up old sleeper wake up to the person that's sleeping on their future on their purpose and get into the rhythm and flow of what god's calling for you to do can i tell you to wake up so that you can stop complaining can i tell you to wake up so that you can stop making excuses for why you're not where you want to be can i tell you to wake up so that you can see the manifest presence of god in your life wake up oh sleeper god is taking the season of your life to redeem everything the bible says that the cankerworm took from you god's saying what i'll do in this season like he told joshua he says everywhere the foot of your soul shall go upon that you shall have because god can do in a short amount of time what you could never do in the whole lifespan it's like wake up sell somebody real quick wake up no seriously you got to wake up you got to wake up to your purpose you got to wake up to what god's called you to do you got to wake up to you're living life very petty right now i like that one i ain't petty just the way you said petty it was petty i ain't petty pastor oh you petty that's why you're still holding on to it and it's blocking you from getting to where you need to go you're blaming it the business fail then get back up and start it again if that's what god's called you to do but stop blaming the world for where you are because when you blame guess what's lingering around the corner depression to make you feel good about what you're blaming yourself for you know i didn't get there i didn't get there either man you know nobody allows me to get there i can never be where i want to be and you feel here's what depression does it makes you feel as if you're the only one dealing with this depression is an isolator it puts you in a bubble where you say you know what i'm the only one who's going through this i'm the only one dealing with it so i have the right to stay and god is saying today wake up wake wake up i've got purpose and everything that is trying to distract you is a part of what the enemy says he would kill steal and destroy he's just trying to destroy your future so all you do is come co-dependent on the problems of your past some of us are adults that never got over our childhood we never got help we never got clarity we never got someone to speak healing into us we never asked god for it so we're adults with a still broken past trying to live out a purpose and future in a place of brokenness in captivity and god says i call for you to have freedom but if you don't spend time going after freedom freedom doesn't come to you the second thing i want you to do establish your priorities based on where you're going not where you've been establish your priorities based on where you're going not where you've been do you know where you're going because if you know where you're going you know what to set up to get there if i understand where i'm going i know what kind of schedule i need to get there the question becomes do you really know where you're going or have you become a slave to your schedule even though your schedule is not a slave to you what are you doing i gotta get up because you know how it works i gotta do this because you know if not this is the result here's what i want to let you know today is that your priorities should be based on where you're going the question yourself today to ask is do you know where you're going if i know where i'm going i know where to set it up if all i know here's what i want to tell you if all i know is that where i'm going is to get money then i'll chase after anything that brings money but if i know that god has caught me in a very specific lane to do a specific work that's purpose for me to do i set my schedule according to that anybody you got too many spaces in your schedule available for everyone else beside you you're coming in how was your day man meetings everywhere did you ever meet with god or yourself oh no because i'm too busy making it happen well what are you making happen i'm trying to get more what did we talk about last week more for what what is the more for the more has to have somebody say purpose i want more money for what a new car let's get real practical what kind i don't know anyone so your level of expectancy becomes a level according to the way in which you operate so if it's whatever i just need god to bless me no no god wants to be specific in his blessings that are doing to you so the context and what you want to operate out of is i know why i'm getting this money because i would like this because i got a ton of kids anybody know you you you you can't buy the truck that you need with the 17 children that are riding in there if you don't understand what the purpose of it's going to be for never get going to the dealership i looked at a car i was like this is it i'm gonna get this i looked at it and i never forget the distance between the back seat and the front seat was about this and here's what i said this is what happens when you have no purpose for why you're doing it you make exceptions for what you get why'd you buy it it was great it looked good that makes no sense don't you have four people where they gonna go oh i don't know but you wanted it and you went after it but i did it without purpose so when i got it it didn't work for my set of circumstances and i'm trying to force things in my life that don't work for where i am because i never had the idea of purpose of what they were for so now i have things that i've gotten that don't work for my current circumstances because they were never based on the priorities of where i were going they were based on the priorities of where i've been you brought a car out of where you were at 18 instead of buying a car out of being a man who has a family today you care what i'm saying why did you come home with a tudor at the top cause i didn't think about where i was going all i considered was what i wanted from where i've been and we start creating our lives around what we think we deserve i sacrifice i should be able to get this car it's a car that no one else can fit in do you have multiple no it's our only car you're trying to get a car seat in it hold on i got it i got it the children is still tired back here hush up watch that mess up because it is the 18 year old you trying to live out the purpose of the 30 year old you you can do it when you got three or four cards or i can just switch the problem is is that where you are and what you're trying to do doesn't fit where you're going proverbs 16 and 2 says this all the person's ways seem pure to them but motives are weighed by the lord everybody thinks their idea is good anybody know that i just know my ideas are good until my wife says it back to me out loud so what you're saying that's how it starts so what you're saying first of all woman i got that from scripture just using jesus words woman this is my time but does it fit where god has you going not does it fit where you've been on point number three live each day out of renewed expectations each day you have to renew the expectation of what god is speaking over your life ephesians 3 20 says it says now unto him that is able to do exceedingly exceeding abundantly got that king james still in my heart above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh somebody say in me the power is at work in me power's not at work and my spouse for me the power is not at work and my parents for me the power at work is already in me i have everything i need to be who god has called for me to be i have everything i need to go where god has called for me to go it's not another resource it's not another time it's not another day it's not another moment the time is somebody say now now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we have the ability to ask or even think according to the power at work in somebody say in me now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that's in work somebody say in me it's inside of me everything i need to be who god has called for me to be is in me the problem is it can be in me and not come out of me if i don't learn this kingdom principle of managing all that god has given me i just want to let somebody know the time has come the time has come for everything that god has spoken the time has come for what you've been feeling on the inside of you the time has come for the things that have been shaking your mind and shaking your spirit i want to let you know the time has come for it to be manifest in your life i just need to know are you ready do you believe that now unto him that is able can you just tell your neighbor real quick he's able tell somebody else on the other side he's able to tell your third choice at their choice he is able he's able but he's waiting on you he's able but he's looking to you [Music] what you got to know today is you got to speak this to yourself i won't give up i'm going to try it again today my last monday might have looked a little jacked up but i promise you this monday won't i'm going to go home and have a schedule and it feels really corny when you're planning because it doesn't seem that very much inspiring but what you're doing is preparing yourself for what's to come i'm gonna sit my clothes out because every morning i have this problem of not knowing what i'm going to wear so i'm going to prepare to not have a frustrated moment with myself see we blame others but sometimes the fight is just within i'm going to posture myself in the place that i set myself above all to say i am going to do that that is within side of me and today i believe that the time has come to see everything that god has called for you to be take place somebody say now i spray father in the name of jesus i believe it today that you have called for us to see the manifestation of the promises that you have set in our life you're calling for it to be now you're calling for it to flourish now you're calling for it to move forward now i believe in this moment that you're speaking to us and you're saying now it's the time now it's the moment change has come we're trusting in you we're leaning not to our own understanding and in every way we're acknowledging you expecting you to direct our path direct us today show us what to do next help us to plan according to purpose not comfort help us to live out of the priority help us to make the decision today to renew the expectation of what you're calling us to in jesus name we say amen
