[Music] thank you welcome to the mix my name is Marcus England and I'm the lead Pastor here and I am so grateful in this moment that you are here with us and connected with us in what God is doing in this place and what I believe today is when you come with an expectation God has something to meet you with and so today we're expecting God to move we're expecting God to heal we're expecting God to set free we're expecting God to move those areas of anxiety and depression right now in the name of Jesus Christ and I'm believing that you're walking out in confidence and clarity through the word of God that he has everything already set up and in store for you just tell your neighbor real quick it's already set up you ain't got to worry you ain't got to fret it's already set up let's get into the word of God we're starting a new series called Heart to Heart somebody say heart to heart and I just want to have a heart-to-heart conversation with you I want to talk through some things that I believe that will impact your heart and as your heart is impacted I believe that you will see change take place in your life the change is not for the betterment of just you but the change is for the betterment of those that are connected with you it's the change of your legacy it's the change of your community it is the change of life as you know it today and so I'm gonna tell you we're going to have a heart to heart and it's from my heart to your heart it's from God's heart to my heart it's from God's heart to your heart today and I want us to start in the talk about what that looks like Matthew chapter 15. come on open your Bible get that Vibe a little bit get that Bible app and we're going to read God's word today now we're going to read God's word in such a way today that I'm going to help you make up for any devotionals you miss this week so I want you to get prepared because there's scriptures to connect you with God's word what I don't want you to leave with is my opinion I want you to leave with Biblical truth and that truth the Bible says if you have that truth that truth can set you free and so I'm believing that today Matthew chapter 15. if you have the word of God somebody say Amen starting at verse 1 it says then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders for they do not wash their hands when they eat this is what the beginning of covet 19. now I'm just playing verse 3 says he answered them why do you break the Commandment of God for the sake of tradition for God commanded honor your father and your mother foreign father or mother must surely die but you say if anyone tells his father or his mother [Music] what you would have gained from me is given to God he need not honor his father so for the sake of your tradition you have made void for the sake of your religion for the sake of your Traditions you have made void the word of God it says you hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said this people owners me with [Music] with lips but their heart somebody say my heart it says their heart is far from me when I was reading earlier this scripture caught my attention [Music] vain do they worship they don't do it in spirit and in truth it says in vain they worship teaching as doctrines the Commandments of men teaching their religion and their preferences as if this is was the word of God it says and he called meaning Jesus the people to him and said to them here and understand you should underline that if you have a Bible real quick you should just say here and understand it's not good enough to hear you must do what it says it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but what comes out of the mouth that defounds a person then the disciples came and said to him as if he was not Jesus do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard the saying he answered them duh no that's not thus written he answered them every plant that my heavenly father has not planted with will be rooted up he says let them alone they are blind guides and if the blind lead the blind both will fall into a pit but Peter said to him explain the parable to us and he said are you also still without understanding have you been coming to church but not seeking him diligently have you been apart but you can't hear his voice he says do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled he's giving them a Clarity but he's not breaking the law the Commandments that were given but he said I want to let you know food is going in and coming out and isn't hurting anybody he said but what comes out of the mouth I need you to get that I need you to understand your speech your thinking what is coming out of you he says what comes I proceeds from the heart when you say it you mean it [Music] you can say oh I didn't really mean to say that but I'm here today to let you know what comes out of your mouth comes from your heart he said and this defiles a person I want to tell somebody today he's speaking at the level of where they are but he's talking about communication all together he's saying this what comes out your mouth what you text what you post on your storyline those little innuendos that you try to do on the side he says I want to let you know all you do it comes from your heart he says for out of the heart come evil thoughts murder idolatry he says adultery sexual immorality theft false witness slander a reflection of what's in you or going on in you comes out in your ideas and in your verbiage and your jokes he said I want to let you know these are what defound a person he said but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone for the first week as we talked from heart to heart I want to come from the topic a heart transplant I want to come from the topic today a heart transplant can we pray today father in Jesus name foreign I pray that you would give us a heart transplant in Jesus name somebody say Amen [Applause] where we're talking through scripture Matthew is the one in whom writes in Matthew that makes sense doesn't it he is one of the disciples but it notices that Matthew pays attention even though we would probably put Matthew as somewhat of an introvert we will put Matthew someone as an introvert because what we know about Matthew is when Matthew was called Matthew was a tax collector and Matthew now shares his testimony of who Jesus is and what he saw from the life of Jesus so here's what I want to let you know you can still be a follower of Jesus and intricately involved in the work that he's called you to do to transform the world and still be an introvert somebody say again men right there Matthew records as one who understands Jewish custom Matthew understands that when we're talking about the heart Matthew sees the heart as not as we see it today we see the heart as a representative of that in which our emotions come from and the heart is a representative of where our love comes from and and that's where we feel from it and so we think about the heart in that manner and then we also think about the heart in reference to the actual beating heart inside of our bodies but when you look at the context of Old Testament and New Testament it begins to give you an understanding that the heart is considered to be the control center of everything that's about you when they spoke about the heart they were talking about the way you think they were talking about everything and and and and and and and and it's talking about the entirety of a person I I remember when when when I think about control centers I don't know if you've ever been in a control center but I have been privileged to be in an actual control center when I was at Universal Studios I was in the control center as I walked through the ride at Men in Black now I don't know if you've ever been to Universal Studios but when you walk through they sort of take you through what looks like a mock-up of the movie and it is a picture it is a diagram a Clarity of what it looked like in MIB and there's people that are controlling certain areas and functionalities of what's happening in there and the ultimate goal of abide is to take back over the control center because it is being invaded by some aliens now I want to tell you that in life and in Truity when we got in the ride we are in control of nothing and as we are in control of nothing we are fighting to get points to make us feel that we're interactively involved in what's taking place in our set of circumstances but I want to let you know today just like that ride that I sat in oftentimes we feel like we're in control but if you want to be honest sometimes you are spiraling out of control inwardly anybody ever been to the place where you cannot get your feelings under control anybody ever been there before where your emotions are losing their mind you're trying to speak to yourself you're trying to make yourself obey yourself but if you can be honest sometimes you lay in the bed and say to yourself I just wish I could get up and have better control of how my day is going anybody just wish you were in better control of you anybody knows sometimes on the inside you are acting up as you are talking to yourself why you see yourself acting up never been there before like get yourself together as you are talking what are you doing no you are going to destroy all of this don't mess it up but you're messing it up as you mess it up can we be honest with it anybody know you watch yourself stick your foot in your own mouth because sometimes we have not learned to be able to walk in self-control somebody say self-control and when we don't walk and stroll we find our set of circumstances for which we are a part of oftentimes what I find out is is we will find ourselves at a place in life where we are trying to get to a destination but the person we always blame there is a person on the inside and it's not the Holy Spirit we're talking about the person on the inside seems to have no control and says and does what they like and that's why I ended up here if you've ever been in a conflict with somebody they'll say this is not who I am have you ever watched yourself and said this is not who I am you ever flipped off on somebody and after what you said this is not who I am you ever looked at somebody as you were driving down the highway they cut you off I know you've been there your pastor's been there and I've given every horsepower created in that engine to go find that person to look at them close enough so they they could see it's only God that kept you alive have you ever been there before there's a person on the inside that seems like they're controlling you because things happen and you don't know why they happen and you're just like I'm out of control because oftentimes we're trying to guard our actions without dealing with our heart and we're trying to change the way we do things without dealing with the posture of where a heart is can I tell you oftentimes you're not dealing with just an action issue you're dealing with a heart issue can I tell you sometimes that the reason why you can't find yourself at a place where you can get control is because you have not dealt with your heart tell your neighbor real quick we got to deal with the heart because the heart is the reason so many other things are going the way that they are when my heart is jacked up I don't have a lane of generosity in what I do I don't know how to give I can be a little stingy I can I call it cheap but it really is stingy being Frugal but it really is a heart issue I have not been in the space for change to take place and who I really am so I give an excuse to everything outside of what I do and here's what I say in giving the excuses that it's just sometimes the way that I am but the way that you are it needs change because I have to change my heart as we look into this scripture Jesus is with the Pharisees and and they see the disciples eating and because water is scarce you've got to be careful what what you use water on it and as they're beginning to eat Jesus says and he looks and he and he has no problem with his disciples but the Pharisees y'all know some people in your life that's always looking at what you do and when you do it and how you do it and they always got a problem with the way that you're doing it because they're not minding their business instead of being in yours [Applause] they always got something to what you're doing something ain't right something ain't good they looking up yourself something ain't worth ain't working all that I've seen better and they're working all in your stuff because they've got some heart issues scripture lets us know that most of the time when you're dealing with people the Bible is saying you're not really going against flesh and blood you're going against principalities and the Bible says in spiritual wickedness in high places and you got an attitude with her what you really need to have the attitude with what's going on in her heart because they are in need of a heart transplant I I want to tell you this is so important because it's one individual piece and the Pharisees are like man what's going on here your your disciples are eating they're not washing your hands and you know that's the custom of the elders because what happens is people will try to push on you what they think is right when they don't have any Clarity of Truth or understanding and the Bible says he starts to check them Jesus be checking people y'all can I tell you Jesus don't mind checking you real quick the Bible says going today he said listen first of all y'all got problems you're Hypocrites let's talk about this all right let me call you who you are let me put you in your place let me tell you what's happening in this moment he says I want to share with you is that you are the ones who are hypocrites who try to put Commandments on people that are nothing but your preference you ever had anybody try to swear you down about something that they believe is law but it's nothing but a preference you ever been there before somebody tries to tell you no this is the way you're doing you like this is not the way we do it and it's like this is the way you're doing you're like this is not the way we do it and it's like this is the way we do it it's like it's not the way we do it that's your preference if you've ever been married before my wife and I we had this thing where we used to it was a little bit of me I used to battle over making the bed babe we got to make the bed they said you got to make the bed first of all who are they and they did not buy my bed so why why am I listening to them but I said we got to make the bed and she said well why I said that's what my mama said we got to make the bed you don't leave out the house and not make the bed [Applause] who leaves out the house and not make the bed to get back home to mess the bed back up you ever you ever had preferences that when you sit down and think about them the preferences are so off that they don't even make sense you just understand you're doing them because they just need to be done because that helps you and it wasn't until I got it that I said babe we got to make this bed and she said I will do this with you but we don't have to make the bed I started noticing that when we didn't make the bed nothing happened [Applause] thank you I didn't feel the need to properly see when we make the bid I would properly get in it you know you fold it back to a corner of an angle 45 degrees and and then you slide in very comfortably and then you put it back over as not to but anybody ever wake up in the middle of the night and it looks like something was fighting you and so the covers that you've spent so much time making now look disheveled half the corner y'all know what I'm talking about you wake up you sleeping on the mattress you're like what happened who was fighting Us in the middle of the night to go back to make it up to get it all back together out of preference Jesus said you've made law what's your preference he said the reason that you've you made law your preference because there's something in your heart that is incorrect there's something that's happening with you that isn't the right way that it should be and he says you need to get it together just tell somebody you know real quick get it together you got to get it you can get it together get it together you have to get it together and you're like which part Jesus is like all of you you know how we try to customize we good in certain areas just as I get all you together All of Me Jesus all of you you got to get it all together so back then they used to use the word heart as being all of you get your mind right get your emotions together get your head right get everything Ryan Jesus like you get all y'all get all of you right and I think on a heart to heart if we can be honest we got areas in every part of our life that we need to get together y'all every area we got some emotional baggage we got some mental baggage we got some stuff that we need to work out my grandson had a birthday party there were so many donuts that's Satan tried to tempt me with and I didn't give in to it at least to this moment right here some of them are still at the house so we'll figure out what happens then but can I tell you that he was speaking about the entirety somebody say the whole me and I want to I want to open that to you Matthew chapter 9 verse four it it it has the Scripture it says but Jesus knowing their thoughts said why do you think evil in your hearts foreign why do you think evil in your hearts he was talking about the way we think Acts chapter 11 verse 23 says is who when he arrives saw the grace of God it says rejoice and encourage them all to remain with the Lord the purpose of heart oh so what are we talking about here purpose we're talking about thinking and the ability for purpose to decide strongly to do something John chapter 16 verse 22 says is therefore you also now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice and no one takes your joy away it speaks about the emotions of where we are and in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 says this let us come forward to the holy of holies with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from Evil conscience and having our bodies wash with pure water I want to tell you today there's a holy you versus a human you and the holy you and the human you are in a pure straight battle y'all know it to be true you probably said it this week I promise you if I wasn't going to that new church oh but I'm two weeks in so I'm not going to say nothing but I promise you don't let me miss a Sunday cause you gonna catch it [Applause] some of y'all attend every week just so you don't raise Cain on your job Pastor I'm here so I don't kill nobody and I want to encourage you keep coming week to week if you need to meet me somewhere you meet me but there's a holy me versus a human me because if we could be honest with it the holy me and the human me are oftentimes struggling because when someone offends you you want to be mad it might want to be mad nobody wants to think about God's word that says in the way in which we forgive others he will forgive us that scripture not popping up in your head is it when you angry you are you're angry and the human you is struggling with what the holy you you hear God's word if not God's word at least me saying you you need to forgive Eli yeah I don't remember the scripture he says so I can't recall it oh it's time you you ever you ever know God to tell you to give something and you purposed what you had for something else anybody ever been here before God's like yeah go ahead and give that five you said five you ever been there you start questioning God's amount because I go ahead give it give a thousand a thousand no I gotta go back before the Lord about that because that was that's too much money for them here's what heart conditions do they block your ability to be able to truly hear God's voice to overcome the matters of the heart that are broken with inside of you see there are things and restraints that you have put on because of past hurt Brokenness or moments of something somebody told you don't let them get over on you so you never give out of generosity because somebody told you if you give too much you're getting played or somebody's getting over on you I want to let you know today if we have God's heart and we receive a heart transplant our hearts make us obedient to what our bodies don't desire to do when the human and the holy me are wrestling I wrestle with who I'm going to love in the way I'm going to love them can I get an amen in here y'all know you ever thought about who you're going to love the way you're going to love him and how you're going to love them you got all the barriers on what that looks like and I'm not gonna do that because you're not gonna get me and you won't hurt me because I've got problems and we built walls anybody got some walls don't raise your hand because if you got a wall you probably not but if you got some walls in your life then the issue is is you've got some hard things that really keep you at the place from really understanding what love is and that's why it's so hard for you to accept the love of the father it's because you built walls because of maybe the love of your father and there are things that bring a barrier that if you could open your heart you would be able to receive the peace and the love and the comfort that God has given through the power of His holy spirit as you follow him that would mend your broken heart and for whatever it is that you lost in your past that's not present in your present and that you may not see in your future you can still say to God be the glory for the great things that he has done you're not impacted or impeded on your process some of us wrestle with supporting others because our time has not come yet because it's a matter of the heart I want to talk to you about the heart because some of the matters of the heart are from broken teaching broken understanding are honestly a broken past and I want to tell you as you're receiving a heart transplant who need to be from where you used to be to where you need to be I want you to understand it's not about where you want to be where you want to be is different than where you need to be because what you want is oftentimes what you lagged and what you lag may not be what you need anymore see I want to let you know that some of us still have a yearning on the inside for something we were deprived but I want to let you know that you've grown up and you don't need it anymore so stop asking for things you don't need as you mature over a process where you'll say well they had it well they needed it you God has put you in a different place so I don't keep seeking after things to tackle as we intro this new series the first question I want to know is how's your physical environment how's the physical environment because this is going to play a role in what you do where you are how you feel what's happening around you anybody know in your surroundings you need what's called A vibe y'all know where the vibe is don't act like y'all know no vibe anybody need a Vibe you know how the vibe is you you got your music set to a certain thing you got if you're from Baltimore you got your Mondawmin incense flowing through the house smelling like somebody's burnt cologne that just went bad y'all know what I'm talking about you got the incense on you got the music flowing where you are you got the lights dim just to assert anybody know about your Vibe your Vibe is when everybody else is gone you in your space doing your thing and you just gotta Vibe I don't need nobody to talk to me I don't need nobody to care man I just got my vibe going on anybody know about your vibe survive how's the vibe in your environment because your environment is playing a role and how you're able to receive what God wants to do in your life I need you to look at your environment because your environment plays a big role whether it's a healthy environment where the it's an environment that connects you with people and puts you back in relationship what kind of environment are you living in because your environment is affecting your heart if you walk into an angry home and you're constantly being berated by what's wrong and what's not happening I promise you it'll be an environment that you stay away from or some of us are forced to live under an environment that's broken because people are broken I want to ask you the question what kind of environment are you in and what kind of environment are you creating because the environment that you are creating is an environment that helps your children to grow up and the healthy sense of who they are when you don't know who you are and you're searching you will create the same broken environment for the people in whom you impact around you [Music] your Brokenness will be their Brokenness your insecurities will be their insecurities your anger all the time will be their anger what's wrong with that kid why are you so angry go talk to the parents do they seem angry because the environment produces a result of what the environment is you've got to figure out am I creating a conducive environment and am I living in a conducive environment because the environment is impacting you can I tell you today the reason why you've got so much fear is because somebody around you has so much fear I I'm listen y'all I'ma share real quick if you seem apprehensive to everything you need to get in an environment that scares the Daylights out of you because your faith less environment you're like I go to church but why is it not you're changing your environment once a week for a few hours compared to the rest of the six days and rest of Sunday that you impact your environment with whatever is around you my question today is how is your environment is your environment conducive for growth or is your environment conducive for death because your environment is impacting your children it's impacting your marriage it's impacting your grandkids it's impacting the health of what you want to do you have to look at your heart and saying what is my heart producing my issue is with the Next Generation that I get scared is that if we have a muted generation that means we have people who are not speaking about the things that are on their heart and they keep it in and so here's what I want to help you do stop damaging laughing at and breaking the next generation's Voice by saying what they have to say say is invaluable because what you do is create an environment that stagnates people from truly sharing where they are and who they are [Music] don't speak unless you're spoken to it's broken it's broken because it means you want me to be respectful without an opinion respect and disrespect are one thing but having the ability to think because it scares you that there's a possibility that your child thinking could open up or someone else is thinking could open up a different way that you see brings fear because now you have a complex in your environment that you always want to be the only one right and the only Authority okay oh I ain't gonna get too many hand claps on that but the ones that did I love you and God has a blessing for you we don't challenge our environments because our environments are conducive to where we are and we all love where we are because where we are is comfortable so instead of staying somewhere and helping to bring about growth we escape back to what we know so that it's comfortable for where we are so that we're the only one right in our environment I'm just interested where do you go that challenges you where are you what environment of space a week do you go in or is it the same job in the same place with the same people you know Rebecca and them man they think just like me that's the problem you keep running into an environment that does not produce growth here's a question you have to ask does my environment produce growth stagnation or death what's my environment producing when I used to get up and go to church Sunday school anybody remember Sunday school assess you had to catch the bus whether you washed or not you just better have some clothes on by the time that bus come that's it you get it up I read I'll never forget when we would wake up in the morning there would be weaa 88.9 plan in the morning when I got up and you know what my parents would make me do with my sister we would stand in the circle and pray together right before we went to church why because there was an environment there was something conducive that they were molding there was something that they were trying to produce just by being in the air and environment in the atmosphere here's the problem you have expectations of the people around you when you have not created an environment for that to be produced out of them right now so whatever it is that you keep creating is the product of what you keep producing and what you keep producing is what you get if we don't talk guess what happens nobody talks if we don't try to make conversations that's what happens nobody tries to make conversation if you are in an environment that's always offended guess what you get offended you think that post was about me you think she was talking about me anybody ever did you ever seen somebody you think that was about me they screenshot it and send it all you think that's about me I I don't know I don't do what happened because instead of looking for positive we search to be offended it's a matter of the Heart Lord I need a heart transplant in my environment because my environment is not conducive to growth and I'm seeing stagnation of fear and here's what I'm trying to tell you the more you pump fear into someone is the more that they'll be scared to operate in your faith stop telling people to operate and believe God when they have never been in an environment of faith that's why you need more time in God's house in an environment where faith is produced because you lack that environment in your past and in your presence so you can't produce what you're not a part of scripture says in Psalm 91 verse 1 through 2 it says you who sit down in the high God's presence spend the night in shaddai's Shadow spend the night in his shadow not moving not not going anywhere just soaking in I'm under you I'm writing your presence however you move however you act however you want to go I want to be in your presence says this God you are my refuge I trust in you and I'm saved the anxiety of where you are is because you haven't been in a trusting place under shaddai's presence you need to be under the Shadow the Bible says of the what Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust you're worried too much because you have not been in an environment where people trust when they don't see that's why Faith doesn't make as much sense when someone's talking it because you are the product of you gotta work for it in order to get it no I've learned through my mother and through the right environments that all I've got to do is believe by faith that God can do the impossible and learn to wait on the Lord and be of good courage and understand he shall what strengthen thy heart that's an environment that's not something you get on a wind reading the Bible when you get a chance on a day when you're not too busy in a moment when you figure out if I feel like it it's something I'm grounded in we don't play church we are God's people [Applause] it's a product of the environment you are a product of your environment [Applause] some of you need to shut the news off because all you do is worry you know too much information for your own good so you have no ability to step out in faith because you now know everything I could take you back to Genesis to the Garden of Good and Eden to the Garden of Eden to the tree of Good and Evil and I can tell you there was a reason why God wanted you planted in a certain way because what he knew is the information of the world will hinder the faith of the Kingdom how's your physical environment Point number two how's your relational environment who's your squad who's your folks who's your people that you're rolling with show me your friends I'll show you your future show me your friends I'll show you your future show me the people in your life I'll show you where you're going show me who you're financially talking to I'll show you where you'll financially settle how's your relational environment you're like Pastor I got here on my own the problem is is you're behind see you're giving yourself credit for what you achieved but what you don't know is you should be further than where you are [Applause] [Music] you need a heart transplant because you're blocking yourself from being in relational connection with people who are called to move you a step ahead than where you are but you like this idea that has been implanted in your head that when you do it by yourself you get bigger kudos here's what I want to let you know if someone gives me a million or I work to a million I will take either one you want to give me [Music] see that's what we do we oftentimes can reject the blessings of God because we have this preference of doing it our way and God says you are supposed to be much further than where you are but you wanted to show everybody how tough you were how you could do it on your own how you got it all together how I don't need nobody else that is a very broken mentality [Applause] you were called to do it with help you are a part of a kingdom the only Glory that is supposed to happen is the glory that goes to God [Applause] you're not supposed to do despite yourself just tell your neighbor you aren't supposed to do this by yourself you were not supposed to handle all of this weight by yourself imma make my way Imma Be A self-made that's broken [Music] that's not a kingdom mindset that's why you're in depression that's why you're having anxiety that's why you're held in the Meltdown like you are it's because you're taking too much weight that you are never supposed to have because there's a point you wanted to prove to let other people know you can handle it and God's saying but here's the problem you're you're kind and you're emotionally and mentally messed up and you over there mad cause I'm free with friends look at him they probably they probably gave it to him yes they did yes they did friends brought all that they all signed up how about you [Applause] I was trying to tell you that I have not while we so are so objective to having people in our lives that can help move us forward to where we want to go we are so resistant in our heart and prideful in our hearts that we want recognition for everything but the problem is is once you succeed now you have nobody to hang with foreign you the only millionaire out your club now you hear supporting everybody if we had done it all together if we had done it in community [Music] I supported you and you had supported me we would have been moving together and we would have been taking these moments together and our families would have been moving together but we had this thing up I want to sit on top and I want to look at you from down low to let you know I made it no no no baby we all supposed to make it God's blessed all of us there's a call on my life your life that's a blessing in my life your life there is a change in my life your life you're gonna have a good marriage I'll have a good marriage you won't have great kids I'm gonna have great kids we're gonna do it together whether you're single married by yourself crazy you might got somebody I want to let you know God called for all of us somebody say all of us we got to make this thing together y'all we're not by ourselves stop doing this thing alone on the side crying day and night and having nobody to talk to God's put people in your life trying to talk about I'm strong nobody needs you to be strong scripture says in your weakness his strength is made perfect [Applause] that's what Jesus talked about he said y'all have traditions y'all have Commandments that shall keep he says that's not my word my word was that y'all would do it somebody said together man we need to we got to get a heart transplant this whole thing of doing it by ourselves is broken listen if can you can you listen people need to see you and be like oh God why because you always hey can y'all help us can you can you help can we talk can hey can you keep me from divorce can you keep us from walking separately can you keep me from putting another generational broken piece on my family [Applause] to Whoever Whenever However wherever where you want me to meet you Starbucks Virginia Florida I don't care yeah because I know we'll extend ourselves for the things we want but not for the things we need [Music] I'm I'm gonna say this and get out the way real quick you you moving kind of slow can I say that as your pastor you moving slow you think you ahead you're not ahead you're moving kind of slow why because you're doing it alone nobody there to correct you nobody there to lift you up because you got it by I wanna I wanna see self victory and God's like the only reason you're in this is because of what I'm doing for you [Applause] you don't need to find somebody where you are and be like hey real quick you know somebody that can help us man we were going through and we talked to what's their number I don't think I should give you you better give me that number foreign I'm trying to tell you you're talking about what am I supposed to do in my job should I keep this job should I go to another one you know this job has kept me the way I mean no no you need to find somebody who is walked out on the job by faith and say what did it sound like when God spoke to you and how did you get where you are you need to talk to another entrepreneur that went through and is now at the place where they're making it and say how can I be a part of the conversation I need to sit down at the table even if I ain't got nothing to say I'ma sit at the table and listen because God you want to do something in me but let's stop doing this thing alone man Luke 6 and 45 says this the intrinsically good man produces what is good and honorable and moral out of the good treasure stored in his heart and the intrinsically evil man produces what is wicked and depraved out of the evil in his heart for his mouth speaks from the Overflow of his heart our last point point number three I want to know how's your spiritual environment here's where I want to get you to the place where your worship with God is no longer weird can I I want to get you to the place here can I worship him wait where you don't have to get to the place where it's awkward to lift your hands in front of your father wait you it doesn't get awkward for you to share and open your heart and say Lord whatever it is that you want to do I I just want to be available to you can I tell you you're in spiritual environment is the greatest thing that you need to be able to conquer your physical environment to be able to conquer your relation or your environment to be able to set the Precedence you need a spiritual environment what what well Pastor I I what's it like I gotta listen to church music all day no no no no here's the thing you need to listen to church music all day if you need to empty something out of you that you have been listening to all the time see the reason is that we pump stuff into US is to get stuff out you you like do I have to no but if you want your environment to stay the same way if you want your heart to see where it's at I can't get these lyrics out of my head and pump some different lyrics I can't get these images out of my head then put some different images in what your mind has already stored placement holder that the enemy has been really good at because the Bible says he's the prince of the air so he's been really good at making sure the spiritual things that he's been doing has been captivating your heart in such a way that now you can recall the Brokenness in the baggage that's been a part of your life without even going back to the place why because he's put it on the inside so well [Music] and you're in your heart trying to say why do I feel this way why do I act this way and the Lord is saying you need to change your spiritual environment take your neighbor change your spiritual environment stop being scared of worship time with God stop stop frowning from the moment of when God wants to speak to your heart and you know you feel a moment you just want to sit and worship with him and say God speak to me right now and we're like I want to be in church but I really don't want spiritual things and God's like you can't have it both ways so I need you to figure out which one do you want to follow me or do you want to worry about what everyone else is saying and be in this moment and say God change my spiritual environment I need I need spiritual friends I need people who think differently and speak differently I need people that can see those things that are not about us but those things that are spiritual because some of the attacks that you have on your life have nothing to do with the people but they have everything to do with the Enemy and the spiritual attacks that he's trying to bring which are fear and anxiety and depression we I was talking with the therapists about this and they say Pastor I've seen so much said that I really believe it's a spiritual warfare but the enemy is so good at making us accept it as something that will always be a part of us that we stop fighting and we accept and we look for ways to cope and I'm here today to let you know that God is saying you don't need to cope you need to be delivered but it's only a spiritual matter that can happen within within the heart there's no YouTube for it there is no click the link and there we go there is a surrendering of your heart to God where you say Lord I recognize right now I am not where I should be a search Mark if you go back in Old Testament this is something that you may want to put I actually use this in baby dedications because it's so important because people don't know what to do we we raise our kids or we raise communities and environments based on our opinions and our preferences I talked about that earlier but this is what was written in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 6-9 he says in these words I command you today shall be on your heart they're not just going to amazingly peer because you changed and came on Sunday it says you shall teach them diligently somebody say diligently they don't get it once they don't get it just because they came one Sunday you got to teach this thing diligently it says teach them diligently to your children and you shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise you shall bind them as a sign on your hand if you want to get a tattoo tattoo the things of God on you pastors say get a tattoo I did not but you're getting them anyway and they shall be frontlets between your eyes you shall write them on your doorposts of your house and on your Gates what does that mean you need to put that thing everywhere talk about it all the time speak on it every moment you can talk to your children once they get out of mixed kids speak the word of life you know what I did yesterday this was a funny Pastor Tyrone was there but I had my grandson I said here's what I want you to do he was sitting in the seat and I'm ending right here he was sitting he was sitting in the seat and uh and he had his hand out y'all he just had his hands sticking out and he's trying to grab at me and I put my head on his hand and I said go ahead pray for Grandpa I said go ahead Speak Life into Grandpa you know I just started teaching him immediately already what am I declaring I'm declaring that when it gets time for prayer and you're in the middle school and you're in elementary school it's not gonna be uncommon for him to walk up to another little child and say real quick you having a bad day let me pray for you why because I created an environment that said it's okay to pray it's okay to believe in what God has said so I said go ahead and pray for Grandpa go ahead put your hand on the Y because I'm already declaring his heart shall not be blocked from the things of God why because I'll teach it diligently I'll speak it diligently I'll write it on the post every place I can I'll speak it by the byways you you are man you've got to declare it [Music] I want to tell you it's not too late it's at 18 ages we AK it's not too late it's not too late don't you let the enemy get a hand on your kids don't you let an enemy get a hand no I don't care how old they are it can be 30 to I will tell them real quick y'all get in here let me pray for y'all okay where y'all at you need God's covering I say that to you today there's three things I want you to do first thing I want to go back look at this week's message when you get it connected and subscribe the Bible says hide that word in my heart that I might not sin against thee the second thing I want you to do is to assess all three environments and I want you to look where change can be I want you to do anything I just I just want you to look God where can I make a physical environment change or relational environment and change where can I do a spiritual environment and change some of you your spiritual environment change is becoming a member and getting a part of a local church [Music] and then the third thing I want you to do is pray for Direction to start change in one of these environments just one somebody say just one and I want you to ask God help me to change if it's an old friend that's been stuck there for a while I got I need you to help me let that thing go if it's a place where I don't need to be but I'm staying there because I'm scared and I've got locked into it because we've been doing it so long I just say God help Release Me From that space it cannot create if it is a place spiritually where you're saying Lord I just feel like I am not where I should be then say Lord help me to make a change today and I believe he'll make that change
