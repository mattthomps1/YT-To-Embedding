[Music] can we get into the word of god everybody i'm excited about what god wants to say can you turn in your bibles to matthew chapter four matthew chapter four hear the mix that we say that readers are what and we want you to take out your notepad we want you to take out your pencil we want you to take out your notes section in your phone because we say that note takers are what world changers we are world changers we're in matthew chapter four we're starting at verse one i wanna read through this and i want you to just connect and read with me if you don't have your bible it'll be on the screen but it starts with this it says then jesus was led up by the spirit it says into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil after fasting 40 days my goodness and 40 nights the bible says he was hangry no he was just hungry y'all jesus don't get angry he get hungry and it says in and the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread but he answered it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god it says then the devil took him to the holy city and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up lest you strike your foot against a stone jesus said to him again it is written you shall not put the lord your god to the test and it says and again somebody saying again i need you to get this pattern because just because that you have ignored or won one battle in your life does not mean that the enemy will not keep coming after you the bible says and again again again the devil took him to very high mountain and showed him all the kingdom of the world and their glory and he said to the to him all these i'll give you if you will fall down and worship me then jesus said to him be gone i'ma tell y'all that sometimes i can preach a message on that i'll preach that later but sometimes you just got to tell the devil as soon as the thought pops into your head as soon as he begins to tempt you as soon as things try to go the wrong way you just got to tell the devil be gone i don't care what you got to say be gone i don't care what you're trying to stir up be gone just tell your neighbor tell the devil be gone be gone satan for it is written you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you serve the last verse 11 it says and then the devil left him and behold angels came and were ministering to him i want to come from the topic this morning understanding temptation understanding temptation can we can we pray today father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that our hearts be open as we have prayed your prayer lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one father i pray today that we not only pray that prayer but that we could understand what temptation is trying to do to our lives for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians i so appreciate you guys y'all can y'all help me give it up for the people that make it happen in this place our dream team can you help me celebrate them thank you so so so much i think it's important that we understand the conversation that we're going to have today because it's important that we understand temptation many times we've heard the word temptation and we say you know what i don't want to be tempted but i want to let you know today that the enemy is always trying to tempt us to go back to the person that god has delivered us from being i want to let you know today that temptation in itself is is not a always a bad thing but the temptation that leads us to the things that are wrong i want to let you know today can be destructive temptation has an alluring factor to it that is always appeasing to the one that is being tempted i don't know if you remember back in the 1960s but there was a group called what the temptations now at first they were called the elgin group as you can see that doesn't have a good ring to it it's not a smooth way of talking but but but they but they were called the elgin group but they became the temptations and here is what what was said about the temptation through otis williams who who who was a part of naming it he said we called into temptations so that we could be alluring to people we we dress in the good suits we we had the slick moves y'all know the moves that they had and they would go back and they would do one of those moves and they would slide on something and you remember when you watched the movie the ladies in the house they would they would be screaming they would be losing their mind because there was something so smooth about the temptations you know what i'm saying mr charles is that they were so alluring that it made the people go wow here's what i want to let you know is that often the enemy understands that temptation will make you go crazy if you're at the right point of desperation and the bible lets us know that as jesus has been qualified what are you saying pastor jesus has been baptized by john the baptist and the bible lets us know that the father qualifies him with the holy spirit to say this is my son in whom i'm well pleased he identifies jesus as being the son of god but the bible lets us know after he identified him of the purpose and understanding he is the messiah the bible says temptation came next can i tell you something real quick that oftentimes you're wondering now why when you got saved it seems like everything that the preacher said went opposite you are more than a conqueror you felt like you were failing all the time i would tell you you were blessed beyond your imagination and you went back and looked at your bank account after service was over and it seemed like it got more negative than it did the first time around but here's what i want to let you know is that so many times you don't understand is that at the pinnacle of the place of where your potential is about to move into your purpose it's the moment where the enemy is ready to strike against you i want to let you know when when he sees that he is no longer your god when he sees that he is no longer lording over you that you have taken off of the robe of darkness and you have put on the robe of happiness and the robe of light he understands that it is game on and i want to tell you today is that the decision that you've made to follow jesus why it is the best decision of your life it is the most fearful decision that you can make to the kingdom of darkness today i want to tell you it's important because if you don't understand temptation you think temptation is all about taking you away from the things that god would not have you to do but temptation actually has a purpose just tell your neighbor real quick temptation has a purpose [Music] it says lead us not into it but it doesn't tell us we won't be tempted lead us not into the temptation lead us not into the place where we obey the temptation lead us not into the place where we give to the temptation but i want to let you know if jesus was tempted so will you if jesus went through him temptation so will you i want to tell you today that temptation can be the catalyst to your destruction that temptation as good as it looks in the morn moment it can be trouble in the night i want to let you know today that temptation can be the catalyst for your addiction contention can be the catalyst for your deception temptation can be the catalyst for your depression and your anxiety temptation can be the catalyst for what you get stuck in but if you know what to do with temptation i'm here today to let you know temptation can work for your good temptation has a moment in time where if you don't know why you're being tempted you can get caught up in temptation anybody ever been tempted before don't raise your hands but anybody ever been tempted before anybody ever been tempted when you knew you were supposed to be on a on a good diet and you knew that there was some uh uh there were some honey buns anybody got that spirit of honey buns that layers right down in your cabinet that thing that works on your spirit there that's freshly in that pack you know when you warm it up in the microwave that honey bunny it will it will it will do something to your spirit it will bring revival in your house temptation looks good let me tell you something about this thing temptation temptation is formed to be appealing to you specifically your temptation is catered to you your temptation is from the things that the enemy knows that you've got a weakness for you might have a weakness for for some honey buns you you might have a have a weakness for some juice you know with a lot of good sugar in it you might have a temptation for some kool-aid i don't know if you know about kool-aid the kool-aid is the very thing that you need there is nothing else in the house i could use the organ right there when there's nothing else in the house but some water and some sugar y'all know about that you come on now i know i've been there before when when when there's no anybody ever you just want to be honest you don't want water anybody have that that's i don't want water i know you're telling me what's in the refrigerator but i don't want water i need something with a little bit of taste and the fastest thing you can make is some kool-aid double packs don't you dare do a single nobody wants no watered down kool-aid from you we need double packs and if you really if you really from the way you will mix a purple a good grape with the blue come on can i get an a minute i feel it quicker than right now somebody go give me a picture i feel it in jesus name listen listen you you will put that thing together and you will watch yourself try to be moderate with the sugar you pour a little bit in it and everybody know you share it but you taste it and you say that's not that's not that's not it that's not it and you add a little bit more to it and you keep pouring you say that's not it yet it's sweet but it ain't sweet enough [Music] your body is telling you sir your sugar level has gone up 50 points you don't need any more but temptation says let's reach for the goal of 100 more points and you pour everything in that bag and you pour so much in if you got the bag of sugar that the tip of the bag of the sugar gets so much in it i'm gonna tell you how because the water level was here but as much sugar that you put in it it got so high that you just like i got to stir it slowly now somebody's been there before because the temptation is to make sure that whatever it is is to the place of my liking not to the place of what i need what you needed was water what you wanted was kool-aid with some serious sugar here's how i'm getting to this point is that oftentimes we find ourselves in the place where we are being tempted for the things that we desire the most the bible lets us know that jesus went into the wilderness he was led by the spirit to be tempted but he was not tempted by the spirit he was led to be tempted and why because temptation can actually bring the right results when you understand what temptation is for if you don't here's what happens every time temptation comes you get scared anybody know you oh god no no not it no no please don't put that in front of me sometimes you need to understand when it's sitting right in front of you it's there to test you pastor i don't i don't need that kind of yeah this makes see here's here's what god knows just like he said when he was allowing the enemy to move in on job he said to him have you ever considered sometimes you're being tested because you're being considered sometimes you're in the place of testing is because god has seen something in you that you don't even see in yourself [Applause] and that temptation is there to take you to the next level here's here's one of the first things i want to i want to jump into our points earlier because i want us to talk about what temptation can be temptation can be a place where god can build trust somebody say trust all right so let's talk about trust this is a place where god can build trust if you're willing to depend on him the devil tempted jesus to create bread to feed himself because he was hungry sometimes the temptation seems legitimate to the need but we are not about fulfilling what we want we're about fulfilling what god says we need here's what i want to let you know even though jesus was hungry even though jesus was at the place where he could change this bread change the stone into bread the bible lets us know that he refuses because he understands this is not the time to give in tell your neighbor real quick this is not the time to give in it's not the time to give in i know what you feel like you need i know what you feel like you feel that you have to have but i want to declare today is that what god has for you is greater than what you believe you need for yourself why was jesus tempted at this point can i tell you jesus was tempted so that he could learn obedience the bible lets us know that as jesus was going to be on his journey he was going to experience some things that were going to come against him to make him try to be disobedient to the father here's what i want to let you know some of the reason that you keep getting tested on your obedience is because you don't understand is that there are going to be some things in your life that are going to try to pull you away from your purpose that god has for your life and if you cannot walk through the temptation that you're in now you won't be able to handle the promotion of the promise that god has given you if you can't overcome the temptation sometimes our temptation is actually a place where if we did yield to it it could bring about results but the problem is is god is more interested in who you're becoming than the end results of what you want to create some of us are like this is the end and if this is the means to the end then i'll justify the actions and the problem is is you cannot justify actions that go against god for broken means it doesn't matter if the end is to help all people if you know the scripture says this he tells jesus turn these stones into loaves why'd he say loaves do y'all think jesus was that hungry that he was going to sit there and eat bread why did he say loaves because he tried to appeal to jesus compassion he said if you turn it into loaves what will loaves do loaves will feed the world and so many times we are tempted through our compassion points that we will move out of our compassion but be disobedient we'll move out of our compassion and say well i did it to help so and so and god says but you've never heard from me so you moved out of your knee to feel accepted that's why you did it you didn't do it because of me you did it because of you jesus had to learn how to control his body his mind and his spirit you need to learn how to control your body your mind and your spirit y'all like nah i'm good i'm all right i control that spirit that body anybody know about that body to be can we can we talk can we be in church and talk about that temptation that that body don't be trying to give up on and you be cause i need because i gotta have cause i want y'all some of y'all woke up when i said body oh jesus there was a quick oh jesus it was a quick what you got to understand is that the body's desire will always be great for the things that can be opposite to what god wants for your life if you don't learn to trust him then you won't learn to be obedient and you will always give an excuse for why you let your body and your mind do what it wants to do the bible says he's trying to teach him obedience somebody say obedience obedience is needed because if though if you don't have obedience then you don't understand what god wants for your life you'll try to sacrifice as saul tried to do in the book of samuel but god says listen i i don't even want your sacrifice it's better that you be obedient so he tries to get him to this point trying to get him to this point i'm trying to tell you your good actions are not greater than your obedience your good ways your good thoughts your good human being ways god is not trying to win you in to be a good person god is trying to win you in to be a person that follows him he's called you to be a disciple not a good person he's called you to learn how to somebody say follow he's trying to teach you obedience in your following so that you don't yield to every temptation the problem is is that oftentimes the enemy will be after you and he knows what you want if you always talk about it in a way not through prayer but through complaining some of you don't even know is that you have given the enemy ammunition through your complaining instead of giving yourself power through prayer and your big component man you know i can't i always anybody anybody know somebody that's got something wrong with everything it's all it's all what's how you doing i'm just you're like oh jeez i don't mind at one time i don't mind it even two times i'll deal with you three times but is it always bad and the bible says he gets them to this place where he is legitimately hungry he says he's turning stones in the bread and jesus says in in in response to him through scripture he he gives them back scripture and and i think this is what we don't understand is because we have not connected in obedience with god we don't know the difference between god's voice and satan's voice because satan tries to speak but the problem is is that you heard a scripture and the problem with it is is that satan knows the same scriptures you know that's why your daily devotional is not enough to keep you it has to be a relationship somebody's a relationship you need more than just five minutes with god in the morning to keep you and to be a follower you need something greater that will not lead you into temptation he said if you're the son of god he said command these stones to turn the bread and jesus hit him back with the word it was like you don't know me man [Applause] he said man shall not let my bread alone here's what i want to let you know you shall not live by your needs you shall live by what god gives you it says man shall not live by what bread alone bread alone bread alone what is bread bread is the thing that i need here i want to tell you today oftentimes you're leaning into what you need as a reason for you to do what you do [Applause] you have a need of loneliness so you excuse what you do in your relationship that's not of god when you're not married because you believe your bread what you need is a greater need than being obedient to god it's quiet just tap your neighbor just say wake up real quick somebody went to sleep somebody went to sleep on me here oh my god can we can we teach this today like can we can we understand that the enemy draws out your addiction your need your desire your sexuality he puts it as a prominent to say you have to quench your needs more than you have to follow god can i talk about the world that we live in the world that we live in says it's okay to do it because nobody's perfect but the problem that we have is that our intentionality is not about being obedient it's about eating our bread and if we don't understand that your bread can make you full and fat and out of shape we sent out a shape pastor yes spiritually so that you can handle nothing the temptation that we have in allowing ourselves to not be obedient to god the bible says if you love me then you do what you keep my commandments you follow my ways you live out my what laws you follow me disciples i'm going to tell you what disciples do disciples follow i want to give you more to christianity i want to give you relationship disciples follow somebody say follow follow we follow in obedience not in preference we follow in obedience somebody say obedience not in what somebody say we follow in obedience and not in preference you got to remember that you got to remember that when the temptations come on you got to remember that when barry white comes on you got to remember that when that extra song comes on you got to remember that when your needs are greater than what you have the ability to be able to express i'ma tell you today that god wants obedience but he wants obedience through you he wants you to know today that hey i am with you and i'll never leave you but don't give in stop giving into the temptations because what you have to recognize that the devil is after you john 10 10 says this the thief comes to steal kill and what destroy but jesus said i come that you might have life and have that life to the what full why is this important because if you don't recognize it you don't understand what god's trying to do hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 says this even though jesus was the son of god he learned somebody say learned he learned obedience by what he suffered what your suffering is trying to teach you he learned obedience through suffering anybody like suffering y'all just need to be honest no i don't like my flesh suffering i don't like my account suffering i don't like some of y'all are thinking about brunch right now your stomach is like where are we going because inconvenience is no longer something for us to endure we are teaching our children and our generations that find comfort as much as you can because if you suffer suffering is not a part of the plan but the bible just spoke in hebrews and it says he learned obedience by what he was suffered so stop just complaining about what you're going through he's trying to teach you obedience here's a lesson to recognize temptation often attacks in the area of desperate need my question real quick is where do you have a need wherever you have that need that's where the enemy is trying to tempt you wherever that need is what do you think about enemies trying to attack what do you have need of enemies trying to attack how can i get out of his enemies trying to attack so i need to understand is that wherever the enemy is trying to attack me that is probably the greatest place of where god is going to give me somebody say breakthrough ah man if i could understand that on the other side of the temptation is a breakthrough and on the other side of that breakthrough is a victory that brings a testimony and the bible lets me know that i overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony if i could just get a testimony that god could give me when i overcame what i thought had me i would have an understanding that the victory that i have in god is not just temporary i can do this thing i just want to tell you you can do this thing you can be single and live for god [Applause] some of y'all just stabbed your neighbor like he is tripping you can be single and still be obedient you can make money and be tight and still learn to be generous [Applause] you can walk in god's obedience can i go even further you can have sexual desires that are not of the will of god and yet still keep yourself in abstinence and obedience to god yes you can [Applause] y'all like pastor you don't know you ain't been single in a long time i know it's hard out here but i just want to tell you you can do it why because god loves you enough that he's trying to work something out of this he's trying to get you to trust him just tell your neighbor real quick trust god if you could just oh if you could learn to trust god in those points in those moments where it seems like you have no ability to be able to hold on to yourself sometimes i'm telling you you're walking up in the room sometimes i'm telling you you're walking into the neighborhood you need to call on the trinity you need to say i need not just god i need the father the son and the holy spirit because i'm about to go down lord help me to be what obedient because my obedience will give me the strength to conquer what is next you're stuck in the same place because you're disobedient in the same place you got to learn to trust next part i want to get you to understand is point number two is our actions the bible tells us that the devil tempted jesus to prove that he was the son of god by two or more acts i wrote this down it was so impressive it says that what he was trying to do is take him out of the place of his purpose can can i can i tell somebody today that the enemy is not attacking you just because you messed up last week we get this idea notion is that when i mess up then god just punishes me because that's how he works and that's the way a father looks i'm here to tell you no god is rich and mercy [Applause] he is rich in mercy if he wasn't you would not be here today but because he is rich in mercy he understands that if jesus could not be tempted to fall into this level of temptation he could get rid of the whole plan that god had in store of redemption for his children why was jesus tempted because he had to secure righteousness he was the ideal perfection and sinlessness what the enemy is trying what the enemy is trying to do is mess with the character of who you are before there was dominion there was character why because jesus told adam i mean god told adam he said this i need you to be obedient i need you to do what you can eat of every tree but just don't eat of what one you can have ladies every other man just not that one lord i need him i need him i pray 21 days i can't wait for 21 days of prayer [Applause] some of us are praying after the wrong things that we we're praying after the wrong things god's like no no we didn't listen i've got so much more for you like i want that one he's like no but i've got a whole a whole land over here no i want that one he's like no no what i need you to do is understand that this action could devastate your purpose if you're not obedient enough this action could devastate your future see what you don't understand is that the enemy is tempting you to break your future so you have no vision to look to so that you don't think that god works why do you need god for something that you have no vision to go after can oh can i tell you real quick if all you had to do is live your nine to five wait back up rinse and repeat what would you need a god for to lead you you would only need a god if you actually had a purpose and if you had a purpose that purpose would be unknown but yet it would be unveiled according to god and the relationship that you have with him so the relationship is needed so that he can unveil the purpose the problem is you're thinking more about the bread than you are the purpose and he's trying to jeopardize your actions so that the action of what you do puts you in a place where you try to eliminate the purpose remember he comes to steal and kill and destroy also remember that he is what he is acting as a lion seeking whom he may devour i promise you right now the enemy is tempting you in all kinds of ways and you think it's a small thing and he says i have been holding up your purpose for the last 10 years of your addiction as long as you're in that relationship you're never going to get to the place past where you are so guess what happens when we get stuck in our spiritual life we look for results in our natural life and we try to make things happen that will entertain us enough to keep us going so that we can say we have something going on but the problem with having something going on that isn't your purpose is that eventually you will get bored some of you are only bored because you're not fulfilling your purpose you're making money you've been elevated you're doing what you're doing but the problem is is that you've escaped your purpose so you keep looking for more and more promotions to get you to the place and you're getting frustrated with the world because you want the world to promote you to a place of fulfillment but it can never get you to the place of fulfillment until you start going after your purpose but you got to figure out what's in the way what's in the way that's trying to keep you from purpose you think that money is the answer and god is saying no your healing and your freedom is can i talk to people that have dealt with addiction before oftentimes once you stop using your first thought is let me get a job and stabilize my life and i'm here today to let you know if you cannot stabilize your spirit your life will never come into alignment you can have every job you want what the enemy oh the enemy is so good that he will provide you with enough money to get you back to your addiction [Applause] and you won't know the difference between god's blessings because the enemy quoted the same word when there's a lack of relationship you don't know how to distinguish so you think every good idea is god's idea but the problem is is the enemy is really good at setting you up why because you're probably on the same loop you were on before you think you're stronger this time and the problem is is that you aren't your faith has to be in god but the enemy is setting you up so good and he's promoting you so well that he knows you can't handle because you're not stable enough to be able to handle where you are so if he can give you and overload you with things you can't handle you will in return because it's too much for you to bear you will go back to what something that gives you relief which is a temptation that's there to uphold and keep you from your purpose you think it's the pathway but the bible says lead us not into temptation well temptation pastor always looks like something that's trying to destroy me no not when it looks like bread and you're hungry he's everything i prayed for this is everything i wanted god don't give you everything you wanted if you're in a wilderness season cause you've got a walk-through process you have only been out of it for two months and now you calling the shots [Applause] how are you calling the shots you haven't built yourself up in the most holy faith so you need something greater than what you have on the inside to build you enough so that you don't destroy your purpose [Music] but you don't understand temptation because you think temptation always comes in the form of the thing that you are addicted to and god said no no no the way the enemy works is he gives you pathways to the thing you're addicted to so that it destroys your purpose can i tell you that when you're resisting the devil for your purpose it hurts because sometimes i'm going to let you know you're not ready to go back to the thing that you feel that you're going after sometimes you gotta be whoa well i don't need that yet i don't need that yet i'm not being lazy but i don't need that yet i need another stage of support i need more community i need more people because what i am doing is i'll build a false idol to myself that i have the strength to maintain my own self but you don't have the word you don't have time with god where is your foundation it can't be on sundays with me [Applause] i'm going to tell you you are sure to fail you don't know what you're talking about pastor you don't know what you're talking about maybe i don't but one thing i know is that in my life every time i think i got a hold of it it's right when it comes back oh you oh you think you're good y'all y'all understand the enemy is so much better at patience than we are he just waits go ahead you start you know how we we start bragging you know what i'm doing i just brought a car he's like you just keep going keep going yup and i just got that place and y'all i just got that man he's like keep going keep going and yeah you know i'm just all set up and then bam he throws temptation and you're like see i knew this was too good to be true why because i didn't understand the purpose of temptation it was not to give me what i wanted it was to make me who he was calling me to be if he makes me who i'm called to be then everything i'm supposed to have comes automatically you don't work for what god already has for you it is his gift to you but the gift is given when there's obedience trust and when you're walking in god's actions not your own can i tell you that some of your victories have given you a mirage that you're good enough to keep yourself yet even though you achieve more in life you're still emotionally mentally and spiritually where you were and some of us have even regressed we got to be careful of our actions second corinthians 5 and 2 says this how will we grow of our present bodies anybody know that body just listen you ever been sitting there and you just find yourself at a place you don't even know why you're thinking what you're thinking and you got to just be like what is wrong with me anybody ever said that before what is wrong with me forget you what is wrong with me scripture tells us we're we've grown weary y'all of these present bodies it says that is why we look forward eagerly to the day when we shall have heavenly bodies that we shall put on the bible says like new clothes all of this brokenness in the bodies that we're in guess what we got to grow weary of it but it doesn't mean we give over to it because there's a new body coming and i promise you the new body is fashioned and fit for the new you [Music] [Applause] psalms 1 1-2 says this all the joys of those who do not follow evil men's advice who do not hang around with sinners scoffing at the things of god it says but the bible says but they delight in doing everything god wants them to it says in day and night are always what meditating on his laws and thinking about his ways to follow him not me him more closely i'm trying to get you in such a way that you're just thinking about god over and over man i gotta i gotta i just man i need to know what he wants for my life 21 days of prayer you should be going in if you've had a year where you just feel like you don't know what in the world is going on if you feel like you ain't got no direction if you feel like this is a moment in your life where you don't know what's next you need to go on in 21 days in prayer and say god you got 21 days [Music] pastor you can't talk to god like that i talked to you got 21 days let's go i'll shut off the tv see we god don't need all day we do that's what we do i need 45 days to hear from the lord no you don't shut it off put down the account delete the app i bet you got to speak to you then what you mean delete what what not tick-tock lord i can't delete tick-tock can i tell y'all [Applause] i i had an addiction now can i be honest i have an addiction to watching tick-tock and just laughing uncontrollably it's addictive i find every funny my wife gets sick of me i'm like babe watch this one watch this she'll be like i don't want to watch that i don't know you missing out and i'm just chuckling guess what hour's gone i'm sitting there like what just happened to my life the enemy is really good because everything he's tempting you with is not the greatest temptation you're like this is not bad it's not a bad thing i'm not looking at bad stuff it means like yeah i don't have to trick you with that because because you are so desperate to be good i'll give you good things that are in your purpose cause you are so enamored with wanting to be good i'll give you good things to waste your time and you between yourself won't know any purpose to it but the fact that you think it's a good thing last thing is that temptation is testing your loyalty the bible lets us know the devil he tempted jesus to prove that he was the son of god can i can i tell you today that the enemy is trying to get you to compromise he's trying to put you in a space of compromising he he wants you to compromise in this moment so that you don't have to go through pain that you don't have to feel what it's like to be in other people's he's like no don't go through you don't have to do all that you'll have to do all that if you just what serve me can i tell you today that through your temptation the enemy is oftentimes saying won't you just come and follow me won't won't you just i know how desperate i know the urge it is a part of you people told you that's who you are and the enemy is telling you that's who you are so you got to be who you are and god says you don't even know who you are i created you i formed you in my image and in my likeness stop telling me who you are i'm the one that spoke life and you existed but the enemy is trying to get your loyalty to be on his side and this is what he told jesus said if you listen i'll give you all of this he always promises you the things that you feel like you can't obtain i'll give you a peaceful relationship a happy marriage i'll give you kids i give you the picket fence i'll give you everything you want if you just what follow me well what's following him look like it means not following and being obedient to the things of god hebrews 4 15 says this for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize and understand our weakness and temptations but one who was tempted knowing exactly how it feels to be human in every respect as we are yet without committing any sin [Music] he knows if i can leave with that point he knows he knows what it feels like he knows the yearning that you're having he knows what it feels and feel out of place he knows what it is to deny the flesh he knows what it is to be betrayed he knows what it is to want to do your own thing but what he's saying today is don't you switch your loyalty for i know what it is i know what it is to feel betrayed i know what it is to feel by yourself i know what it is to feel like everybody's talking about you i know what it is to be spat upon i know what it is to be lied on i know what it is for people to walk beside you and not even say a word i know what it is but don't allow the temptation to make you move from where i've called you to stand stand firm on the foundation of god stand and don't you be moved but you stay loyal to god you say lord i'm yours anytime you want me i'm yours whatever you want to do i'm yours i'm loyal to you i won't go back to where i used to be because where i used to be is trying to break me and take me back i won't stay where i am but i'll live out your word i'm loyal i'm loyal when it's hard i'm loyal when i got the money and i don't got the money i'm loyal when they pay me and they're not paying me i'm loyal to serve you i'm loyal to be relentless with you i am loyal it's not about everybody else it's about you i serve you i worship you i'll honor you i'll stay with you you are my god i am your sheep i will follow you i hear your voice i know your word that you speak to me so whatever you say yes lord is my answer i will not worship any other god i will not bow to my desires my wants and my needs i will serve you with all my heart when it gets hard when i feel by myself when i feel broken i'll serve you why because i'm loyal anybody know some loyal friends they're just there it don't matter what happened what you do where you go and that jesus said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you even when you mess up anybody in here gotta praise that god was loyal even when you mess up even when you get win against him even when you were disobedient he was still loyal you say you're my son and my daughter i won't forsake you even when you mess up to the worst degree he says i'm with you i'll never walk out on you so don't you go serve another god because you believe god can't understand when we get into this day of prayer and i'm telling you when you hit prayer in the morning uh whether it be this afternoon or monday morning you go to god with everything lord this is how i feel i'm depressed i got anxiety my hormones are crazy i'm losing my mind i want to be disobedient but what i made a decision to be is loyal so with everything that is in me i give you praise even though i want to do everything that's opposite to you i understand today i'm being made new in my mind i understand today i am what a new creature in christ jesus so god as you change me i'll make things all new i'll walk away i'll break free from it i'll say yes lord to your will and to your way [Music] whatever you want me to do i'll do it i'm loyal it's not about how i feel i'm loyal and you never have to ask me who's silent on i'm loyal i'm not caught up in my emotions i'm loyal see here's what you do i got to say this real quick what you don't understand with some people is that they have made a resolute decision in their minds come what may it is still yes hell can breach over and it can swallow me with everything but my yes is a yes [Applause] not backing down i'm not quitting i'm not going somewhere i'm not leaving the call that god has over my life said yes i made that decision a long time ago i don't need to keep making that decision over and over it's a yes [Applause] [Music] stop patterning back and forth with your relationship and proven to yourself oh i know god no you don't know god because if you knew him you would be like him and if you be like him you'd be standing well firm well it doesn't matter what comes it way i'm still saying yes it's cool yes in my depression yes in my anxiety yes in my addiction yes when the cravings are there yes when the desire is there yes i'm still saying yes that's relationship that's what love looks like you don't get to quit when you want to [Applause] you just gotta stick it out that's what i tell couples right you gotta stick it out i don't matter you'll get the you'll get the walk out and just i'm out what you committed to something i don't want to say it like that y'all sit down but we gotta start living up to our word man we got to be men and women of christ you know why the world is so tricky and they're so you know why the world can't get a gauge on us because we're so shaky we're so up and down we're so emotionally gone every minute of the day they're trying to figure out should i follow you no not today i don't feel like it i just need a minute if you can like no it's yes you can follow me when it looks bad you can follow me when it looks good you can follow me bro you can follow me with a lot of money you can follow me why because they'll say yes this thing ain't weekly it's already us [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody's trying to figure out who who do i follow you you in the day nah i'm not in today but i'll be in i'll be in next week oh let me can i follow you no not this week really listen i got brunch this week don't follow me this week catch me next week my loyalty to church is not my position [Music] i'm just trying to tell you if i was sitting in your seat i'll be right there serving making a difference i did it for years with multiple pastors [Music] not quitting and giving up because i didn't get my way that's what made me that's what six years listen 20 i know i ran over i know i know but i just got to tell you this in 19 18 years old diagnosed with chronic kidney disease immediately went into dialysis for six years while i prayed with my grandmother who was a woman of god and god said nope you're gonna go through the whole thing [Music] six years [Music] multiple surgeries two heart surgeries [Music] and back then the call of god was on my life but it wasn't about the call it wasn't about what i thought i was gonna be my yes wasn't about what's it gonna look like my yes was automatic so what it did was it built me so i don't have the ability to quit he didn't build a quitter [Applause] i didn't get to quit in six years i didn't have the ability you know what i want to do this today i'm out no no no i had to stick with it charles you're going to ride it through so guess what god created he created a ride or die christian [Music] i'm a up i got every mark in my arm from seven years of getting needles that were the size of pencils every other day [Music] so men know i don't know how to quit i don't know how to back down i don't know how to not go after god and not have a vision when you get offended no i don't have that in me why because i was built differently i went through the trial i did not quit on the drugs sitting there i went through it [Music] i want to say nothing small you know but you ain't got no passer there's no punk [Music] i've been through something i don't walk through something maybe they just build them differently these days but i don't get to walk out when i don't feel like it i don't get to quit when i don't go my way i don't get to walk off and say you know what i want to do it this sunday i gotta stick it in why because i was called to it it's not a job you don't get to walk away from callings you're not called to anything you can walk away you can walk away from jobs you can walk away from any of that but you can't walk away from callings so when i feel like i come you don't know how many pills i take in the morning you don't know how many things that i go through to get it together just to stand here but guess what i don't take the glory for that it's all because of him but i understand [Music] what temptation has done it's made me and this is not at anybody y'all i'm just sharing my story i just don't know about this flighty christian relationship stuff i'm in it to win it we gonna do it let's do it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my teams know that my staff know that just i'm at it i don't i don't know how to do this like pansy kind of you know when you do it for me i do it for you it's like you're going to serve them or not it's your relationship we get in there we do it and we do it to the glory of god why am i telling you all this because when i tell you that he has blessings beyond what you can imagine a thing i don't want you to think that i'm up here standing without going through temptation and broken moments and sorrows and pains i've gone through it and i'm going through it but i ain't giving up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm just talking to some people in here just lord lord for me guys real quick i'm gonna tell you this i'm talking to somebody in here who you have been self-sabotaging yourself [Music] because of how many times you said you were going to come out but you didn't and you are wearing you out and you have been trying yourself to overcome [Music] and i just want to relieve somebody in this moment that god says that it is going to be impossible by yourself but he says with him all things are possible listen i never had i don't want to say it like this but in church i don't remember the weak side it was always about being strong you got to be strong like you gotta you just got to be strong no you got to realize i can't do this but i ain't quitting [Music] and so i opened myself up to god today and i'd say this to you there are many of times where i wanted to quit i'll probably go home tonight and be like my god i was so long i should not be pastoring or preaching i'm going to tell you that just straight up i'ma tell you that i i shouldn't but what i'm going to tell you today is i believe that god is calling you to something greater than you've ever seen in your life but you cannot do it of your self [Music] [Applause] you need to understand the power and the presence of the lord is with you
