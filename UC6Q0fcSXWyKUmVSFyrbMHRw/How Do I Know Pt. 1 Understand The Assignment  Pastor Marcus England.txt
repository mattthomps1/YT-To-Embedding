[Music] thank you so we're going to talk a little bit about relationships relationships anybody know that relationships can be tricky anybody know if you want to be honest relationships can be great and relationships can be stressful relationships can be something to brag about and relationships can be something to cry about can I get an amen right there there's something just unique about the idea of two people coming together who are different who are unique in their understanding their way of life the way they've grown up the way that they have done life together and and they're uniquely coming together to try to fit themselves at a place where they can really understand each other and communicate well but there has been this notion that there's even been books written about the uh Men Are from Mars and women are from Venus meaning that there is such a complexity in the way in which that men and women understand one another that it doesn't seem to just come naturally if you be honest many of you would would see that is this is a complex issue if I could just understand men if I could just understand women life would be much better but I'm here today to let you know is that I'm not sure that you will ever understand but you will come to a place where you can begin to move and operate in a way that can be conducive for the situation that you are in I want to let you know today that I think there's something special about understanding how God has formed and created and put us together informed us as Psalms lets us know in our mother's womb but he even before we got there he was forming and creating us behind the scenes to create somebody and someone that's pretty amazing to what God has called for us to be now as we jump into it I I want us to get an understanding and I want to give some credentials I don't have massive High credentials but I do have credentials I I am going on celebrating 15 years of marriage thank you so I'm not one year out and I'm not five years out and I'm not even 10 years out I'm I'm going into 15 years 15 wonderful long 15 wonderful years with my amazing wife now when we when we met we we were working together I don't believe that was any interoffice policy on it and so uh we we came together and we connected in and and and and and and and my wife uh she she I I I I saw her before she saw me I don't we I always tell her this story I saw her when she was in training and I never forget saying to the guy that was beside me I said my God who is that and they said to me I think that is the one of the leaders or one of the managers here said my God now I didn't think any more about it because I'm a Godly Man now I was not I was I just looked y'all I just looked I was I wasn't listening I was just looking and and when I saw I said my God and God said it was good that's what he said and so I kept it going I stayed focused so that I could get the job I could keep the job that that I was doing but I did wind up meeting up with her when I met up with her uh she wasn't the nicest to me uh but I understood that there was some work that needed to be done inside of her I understood that I God had placed me in her life to help break the Yoke of bondage may I get an amen no don't say Amen to that but I'm I'm just here to let you know that that in that time we had the opportunity to be able to connect and to get to know one another now in that season I was not in the in a season of necessarily where I was looking because I was actually in a relationship but you know when when you're not tied down tied down when you're talking talking but you're not talking talking you you got a little Freedom you got you got a little space not to roam too far but just to say God and now if this if this ain't the one you got to tell me because what I need God to do is tell me before I get in it not after and so we met and we connected and and and and and and we we had a breakup y'all can I can I can I be on we had a breakup Charles and I usually don't go back to my breakups because once I'm done I'm done I'm the somebody say move on [Music] name back and I couldn't blame her I couldn't blame her she when she came back I said I understand I understand you couldn't you couldn't stay away but for so long I I understand what Drew you back in and so the Bible says we must have Grace yeah I said come back my child come back [Applause] but we we connected and we started doing life together and when we made a decision to truly connect we begin to share and to tell each other of where we were in life and some of the areas that we were really strong in some of the areas we weren't so strong in and things that we brought with her and with us and and I had my own struggles and and she brought with her hers but we made this decision that if we were going to do life together then we were going to do the totality of life together and so when we came together my wife had three kids our three daughters Maya taishia and Kirsten and so we begin to blend as a family so I know what it is to have a blended family I know what it is to stay married and having a blended family and so now we have three girls one grandson no dogs and 15 years later God has kept us and so I don't speak because very arrogantly people can speak out of the context that they know better than I'm going to talk to you from what I know that we've gone through see talking about what you've gone through not just what you assume happens gives you a little bit more understanding and context that you can make it even when things don't seem as perfect as you thought they would be if you grew up understanding I I want to let you know Disney kind of gave us a a a a a picture that life was always supposed to be romantic I don't know if you understand that but every time there there's this picture that it's supposed to be perfect somebody say perfect here's the best thing I want to let you know ahead of time there is no perfect relationship there is no perfect person I know you think you are amazing I know you think you are right all of the time I know you think you have the answer to everything I know you sit on the throne with the best of the best I know that you have it all together but here's what I gotta let you know you are not the perfect one in the relationship and so as I'm walking us through there's a season right before my wife and I got together that was a season where I was not dating and I would call this season your stay season somebody say stay season the reason why it's a stay season because it's a season where you're staying grounded where you are where you're staying focused in the things that you're supposed to be doing it's a season where you understand I may not be looking for something I may not be in the place where I'm going after something I'm just in the place where I need to somebody say stay there's a place and a time in your life where you need to stay it's not about who you're with it's not about who's around it's not about who you can get with it's not about who you can feel your time in your life with sometimes you need just you and God and some good friends and a mentor around you so that you can grow and become who God has called for you to be you do not always need to be in a relationship there's a stay season a season where you park and you say God whatever it is have your way Paul lets us know that this is an important season he says if if you were like me I would ask that you uh the Apostle Paul as he's writing about relationships he says in order really to do the work that God has called for you to do and complete it and finish it especially the context of scripture during that time where there was a lot of monitoring and when the ministry of evangelism was not about you jumping on a camera and calling someone it was you going to distant lands and not being able to come home in a recent time I want to let you know that the context of what Paul was saying is in order to do this work to begin the church he said I would that you not get married because it allows you the full freedom to devote all your time and focus to God he says if you get married then your time and your focus will be shared with your spouse so there's a stay season where you need to get to know who you are one of the most complicated and irresponsible levels of our life is to join with someone else and not know who you are it can be one of the most broken stages that you experience because when you don't know who you are you will walk into a relationship asking someone to Define your identity that you have not taken the time to search after seek after for yourself that's why the Bible lets us know that we're called to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and it says in production of seeking all these things will be added on to you in your stay season it is the season for you to build the friendships that will be sustainable in your life it is the season where mentorship and Clarity come into focus it is the season where you begin to figure out what your next steps are it is the season where you take the time to develop your gifting many of the times that we're finding ourselves involved in relationships and moments too early in life is where you are in a relationship or you're in a marriage and now you're trying to find your identity while your time is no longer available to give it over to a full individual and you need to know Who You Are you need to know what you like you need to know what you dislike because here where you form an understanding of who you are is where you form your standards for who you'll connect with it's important for you to get that when you don't understand that you set the standard of who you want in the relationship instead of setting the standard before the relationship that's why any available person open you're so open to get because you haven't set the filter to who God's called you to be with yeah if you knew what you knew now before you knew about who you were going to be you would have thought differently about who you got [Applause] that interrupted you becoming who you want to be because a broken relationship can change your life and disturb your direction that you will work harder and work with all your might to just find out who you are let alone become one with someone else so in a state season it's your responsibility to know who you are just tell your neighbor real quick Know Who You Are it's important because if you don't know who you are you don't know who to get if in the season and where you're getting it you don't understand what God's called you to do then guess what you start getting all frazzled and all scared you start working yourself up because what you're doing you haven't defined your purpose and not defining your purpose it means you're operating out of your need and when you're operating out of your need it means that you're set in a place where you don't know who you are and you don't know where you're going so you're now operating out of what you need instead of out of who God says you are if you operate it out of who you are you would understand what fits your criteria and what is about you taking the next step and being in a relationship with somebody here's the broken part is that you have a list according to what you think you need but the problem with your list is that it doesn't go to who you are it's superficial I want somebody's tall it don't matter if they tall because to deal with you they've got to have patience you don't need to be praying for height you need to be praying for somebody they got some patience cause your mouth [Applause] I'm just saying now I want to give a quick advice as we go further in this if you're married be careful how much you yell out foreign be careful what parts you scream at and be careful jumping up saying amen at the wrong time I'm here to keep your relationship together not break it up [Applause] the idea is that you got to understand your assignment what's understanding the assignment in Genesis chapter 2 what happens is that God creates man the Bible says out of dust so I want to let you know that man becomes this foundational Point man becomes this obsessed this this person this individual created in the image and likeness of God and when God creates him he understands this is good the Bible says he saw it and it was good he saw it and it was good he saw it and it was good and the Bible tells us that now he gives man the assignment of naming animals my question to you is that in your assignment do you know what God's called for you to do as you're working out life and figuring out where you're going do you understand your assignment if you understand your assignment here's what happens your focus in on your purpose and not focus in what you don't have purpose gives you Direction and purpose gives you something to look to and work to the reason so many single people notice they're single is because they're not filled with purpose they're filled with activities events and Casual moments of connection and when you have casual moments of connection it's so empty that it leaves you wanting more I don't know if you've ever talked to somebody with purpose but purpose people don't have a lot of time to waste they don't have a lot of time to give you their their calendar looks like it's pretty full there they're working out what God has said over their life they're figuring out what's the next stage and what's the next piece there they're going back to the word of God and asking God God what's the clarity and what you said it what's the clarity and what we're called to do and so they're on assignment the Bible says Adam is sitting and he's in the Garden of Eating and he's naming Animal by animal as God is sending him the work you gotta get in your stay season God is sending you what you need so that he can develop Who You Are in your stay season the reason why you're in your job where you are is because God is trying to somebody say develop God wants to develop you in your unmarried stage so that when you move into a stage of pursuing and a stage of marriage here's what you understand I have gone through process and process is helping to make me it does not complete me but it helps to make me some of us are going into situations and we have not been made at all so we don't know who we are we don't know where we're going and we don't understand the next stage of our life so we're finding people around us to tell us who we are the problem is they're just as empty as we are right and they cannot give us the definition when two people who have a loss of identity join together do two of those individuals have no clue where to go together so it's hard for them to become one flesh because they cannot combine in ideas and thoughts and vision and perspective and purpose they're always fighting about Direction because they were never clear about Direction at the beginning because they didn't know who they were you can ask me about how much somebody makes you can ask them about what job they have but the question you need to ask them is where are you going you ever gotten a date and sit down so tell me a little about yourself well you know um you know just it's a little bit I got some I I'm I'm this age and I'm I got this going on in my life and and this is where I am and um you know I'm doing pretty well for myself and and and and if you drove up in the car you know what kind of car driving and and you know I live with or I live by and and and and these things are who I am and then you need to go back to the question and say no no no I didn't ask you what you built or I didn't ask you your occupation I asked you who are you because if you cannot Define Who You Are there is no way I can join up with a missing identity some of us don't understand we have a missing persons report that we need to be filing because we don't understand who we are and we've combined with people who don't know where they are or where they're going and when you call see one one of the things one of the things that's so important is that you can clarify at least where you're going where are you going means I've done the work to seek the father to ask him what's next the Bible says God brings the Animals Adam starts naming them here's what it states God said everything that else God did he saw it was good this is the moment in Chapter 2 where God says the Bible says God says it's not good that man should be alone guess who recognized it God guess who's recognizing it today us because we're comparing where we are with where everyone else is and if we had done really good development you would have some friends in your life that would be like just pause for a minute I know you think you ready but you ain't ready for what's out here because if you really look at what's out here is Slim picking can somebody say Amen if it was easy you would have got married if it were there you would have done it already problem is Slim pick it out here why because the exchange of the value that I have for the exchange of the value that you have our exchange is not equal my wife was talking on a Prayer call one day and she talked about when we go to other countries and we give them our money and they give us money exchange back and we look at it like no I don't want pesos I want dollars because why the exchange looks equal to you it's not worth the value to me if you don't know your value and you try to exchange it with someone else who doesn't have the same values you have it's going to feel like an uneven exchange and when there's an uneven exchange it leaves you saying did I make the right choice all right the Bible says Adam didn't even notice that he wasn't good when you're full of purpose you're not sitting around contemplating what's not good the Bible says you're doing what giving all things you get God I thank you for what I got I thank you right now I'm gonna say something married couples just sit still but I God I thank you Lord you're so amazing because single people I want to let you know whenever you want to spend a dollar you don't have to worry about a soul you don't have to take consideration until who else is going to be eating off of this pie you don't have the responsibility to let anybody know nothing you can say this is minds and Minds all by myself [Applause] breathe but when it's different you got somebody calling you did you just get gas did you just get got did you did you fill up the whole tank I told you half the tank you got somebody checking alerts coming in okay some of us are so quick to want to find something when we're so incomplete that we don't understand what's on the other side and we always believe the grass is greener but the issue with the grass being Greener is that you have to be prepared to be able to mow that grass if you can't mow that grass don't get a backyard the Bible says Adam did not even know that he was in need because he was what in the purpose of what God told him to do Lord what do you want me to do name the animals all of them all of them all right so he's naming them he's naming them and God is watching and he says this is not suitable for man so he begins to say okay I need to find a somebody say a helper I need to find a helper suitable here is where we've got to take in you want to know how do I know this is the right person how do I know this is the individual I need to be with how do I know this marriage is going to last how do I know I'm with the right person how do I know now is the time the Bible lets us know you're called to seek God's kingdom first everything else will be added but while you're walking in purpose you're not constantly seeing what you don't have you're constantly seeing what you do have God says you know what um might be time for you to let's get some things going here might be time to get you focused because marriage is a blessing but can I also let you know your unmarried days are a blessing just as well single people you need to say Amen right there here's the first point I want to get you is when you're in purpose you're not easily distracted some of us are playing the game of comparison so crazy and we're losing our mind you have no clue what other people are doing you have no clue where other people are you have no clue what other people are doing in their life but you have focused your attention on what you believe is right what you believe is together what you believe is healthy what you believe is relationship goals y'all know how we do relationship goals me and boo hashtag Bay hashtag one day hashtag can't wait hashtag sit down somewhere and get to know who the heck you are so you know your value so you don't have to front for the camera but when things get into the dark it's a hot mess [Applause] because we love capturing the good moments but there's some real moments going to 15 years of marriage there's some real moments there's some moments where you doubt there's some moments where you question there's some moments where hostility comes in there's some moments where you start praying before God there's some moments where you don't know what's really happening there are some moments where you get frustrated and you can only lean on God but if you don't have a relationship with God and you don't know who you are you will not be able to stand the test of time and you'll be the quickest one to the next place asking can I get this and all can you let this go can we get a divorce and God is saying I meant for marriage to be forever not an option good but I gotta understand the assignment and the question is is do you understand your assignment actionable real quick you understand your assignment you may not know all of it but do you understand your assignment you may not be perfected in it but do you understand where you're going you may not have it all together but do you understand what God is saying over here may not have it all in perspective do you understand the spiritual gifts that God has placed inside of you you may not have it all together you might be broke but one thing you got to know is where you're going my wife and I those are those those early years you talking about pumping gas you're talking about twenty dollars in the bank account and knowing that if you did credit it would take out only one dollar right now and leave the rest and it will come out later you talking about watching a car get towed away you talking about the moments where you got to figure out who's going where who's doing what and how we gonna make it happen here's the thing my wife knew this I know you're going somewhere men can can I tell you that in the time where you're connected and your family is trusting you to lead them you need to know where you're going you may not be there you cannot have it all together your finances may not be where you want them to be but here is what I know I am going to get there and not because of what I have in my bank and not because of what we drive and not because of where we live but because God has given me direction because as a man and as the first one on the spot that God said there is something special about you God has declared that I lead us head of my home if you can't lead your life how are you gonna lead other people hey how are you gonna leave pasta how do they go how are you gonna leave somebody else how you gonna have faith for your family to know it won't always stay like this how will you be able to speak life and prophesy and have three daughters and not want to shoot everybody that comes in proximity it's going to be because of God and having and having girls I was talking to our youngest the other day and I and I said to her anybody ever you know I gave her the speech but the speech was I need you to know who you are and where you're going that's what I said we sat on the couch and we talked can I can I tell y'all Real Talk dad daughter like I need you to know where you're going I need you to stop being so pressed out here I don't need you getting into debt  like I want a new car I was like Drive the Raggedy one you got now let that thing fall off let the wheels fall off because guess what you're gonna have savings and no debt this is her season of stay she's home with us she's connected why is it so important because there's something to pour into her that she's got to learn now so that in her season of pursuit she doesn't just go off with no values no understanding no Clarity and make decisions based off of what she does not have information for I've got to let you know this today so many of us have found ourselves traveling in this world without the right information for somebody to sit us down and say this is what God is saying and this is the way in which you need to go go there for thank you but when you're in purpose you're not so distracted some of us are everywhere we have no context to what we're doing we're distracted because we're trying to meet up with other people to live like they live and the problem is is that you're not called to live where they live you're called to live where you live go back look at your pay stub and say no no this is my life I'm gonna live in the boundaries of what I have here because showing you that I got fancy shoes or a nice car or a couple bedrooms and I'm living miserably it's not the Abundant Life God called me to live I'm just saying it's all about living the best life God has called for you to live but if you're distracted with someone else's purpose and someone else's relationship and someone else's life you will be off track and all you'll find yourself doing here's how you know you're distracted you know you're distracted when you're complaining more than you're thinking God because you're focused on what you don't have instead of being focused on what God is already giving you the question is what are you doing with what you already have because whatever it is that you have is enough for where you are when it's time for more God will give you more Point number two God understands what you need before you need it Adam didn't turn to God in the garden because he had real good relationship and said hey God I just want to let you know pretty lonely down here hope you will help me out some of us start our prayer asking for me when we need to start our prayer asking for the Holy Spirit God fill me with your spirit so I know where to go and who to be God knows what you need before you need it God knows what you need before you need it God knows what you need before you need it here is a context When you pray you're late thank you [Applause] you know how we like I went to God I'm gonna tell you you're actually late God's like I already knew you needed I'm just waiting for the right somebody said the right season because there's sea time and harvest I've got to wait for what the right time for God to give me what it is I need so if God knows what I need before I need it then he is well aware of where I am in my life so you do not have to struggle with this idea that God does not have a perspective of where you are he can meet your needs right where you are you just got to be available to say God I'm gonna stay focused in my purpose ain't gonna get or caught up out of here about what they doing what they got going on I am going to stay so that I can learn and grow and where you've called me to stay and grow and be don't get distracted and know that God knows what you need before you need it if God knows what you need before you need it then you say Pastor why pray because he wants to hear you make sure that by faith you're asking him to do something about it in the relationship season of your life here's a Clarity of what I want you to understand and what I want you to get in the most absolute understanding is that you do not have to keep praying for a mate as if God is passing you by stop asking God why did she get a man and you didn't stop asking God why he got a girl and you didn't obviously God is really good at making sure that the timing is correct when you need it because the Bible lets you know I just want to let you know fellas when you loykey and you'd be up there trying to get it the Bible says a contentious wife it's a really bad thing she will wear you out and ladies you want to be strong [Music] when he's strong and doesn't know who he is he's controlling and manipulative now you can't do nothing go nowhere and be with nobody because you were so desperate for something that you thought you needed by what you saw instead of what you needed by what God Said so yup he's six feet yeah everything you desired yep you pulled out that list and got exactly what you wanted with somebody who doesn't know who they are now on your list you make a cringe because everything you were asking for isn't what you needed you need to understand that God knows what you need not just what you want the Bible says that he God said man does not have a suitable helper somebody say help her a suitable helper Point number three to get a helper I made you say this real quick so so you you might be where you are right now because you you're just too selfish to be in a relationship [Music] I had this moment I'm a share my wife and I we were sitting at the table I said babe boom something just hit and she was like uh-huh I said I got I got something to tell you anybody like somebody's full attention when you're talking to him anybody been there before [Music] he's all far away I kind of felt like she wasn't listening to me Mike she was like go ahead and say it I said no no I want to see you come in here where I am come on let's talk she came in I was like oh my gosh I can wait for Sunday I was like it is too good you are getting this hot off the press be grateful [Applause] I said you know what I'm noticing and she's like what I said foreign people don't know what love is said we've adapted this idea that love is this feeling that we have to continuously keep feeling and then we when we don't feel it anymore we've run out of it it's no longer there it's empty I said in this idea of Love is is is it's broken because we think we fell in love in a moment or space beloved happened over a period of time it was the thing that I said to you that made you laugh it was the moment where I looked into your eyes and and and we had a moment it was a it was the opportunity when I was standing by your side just to support you in a time of in hard moments of your life it was it was the opportunity where where where where we just we touched hands and and and and we just felt you're there for me and I'm there for you I said it was in exchange it wasn't a moment because if you think about those of you that have fallen in love you can't think about the thing that made you fall in love it is the time it is the the amount of things that have taken place it is the moments it is when I opened the door when I gave you the rose or and so here's what we do when we fall out of love we tell people go back to what you used to do but it's not the thing that brought us to that point it's the moments and the opportunities and it's the way that your heart was open and available and when I talked you didn't ignore me but you were attentive to me and and and all of these things built a moment that made my heart open to love it wasn't a thing it wasn't a rose it wasn't a gift it wasn't it wasn't a thing it was it was a moment of time to happen and it brought us to a space where there was something that connected that I really don't know how it connected it just did it was right and I said but what happens is we we get into relationship and we stop having moments and I said it's not that you got worse so I got worse I say you know what happened is that we have these languages of love and we feel so empty and deprived that we're looking for someone else to fill our tank and when they don't fill our tank we reply with reserving our affection and moments and we keep them to ourselves can I give y'all an example real quick I said like this I said if I come in the house and I like the house clean because I'm an acts of service kind of guy and and it's it's not about women clean it listen I will clean up my mother has taught me chores very well that house in the shape y'all I got no problem with that but the idea is if every time I come into a space and environment and my love language isn't filled and and that language makes me feel light I'm empty of something every time I come in it's stuff everywhere it's all over the place and I said and you don't take notice of it say something about it to respond to it to help make it better I said what I think is is that you don't care and I feel disconnected from you but I haven't taken into account that you've worked all day dropped off the kids [Music] driven all the way over town came back just walked in the house and so now [Music] where where my displeasure lies is in you even though you aren't the fault I said and then you want affection from me and think that when you come by and you know you you you brush past me in the kitchen and I don't respond because I'm still fuming from The Acts of service that wasn't done I don't have to give to you right so now that I don't have to give to you both of us are empty and because both of us are empty I think that you no longer love me the way I should and you think I no longer love you the way you should and so now we say we're falling out of love but the problem is is that I'm just empty of what you used to be able to give me and I haven't readjusted my level of expectation so to understand that in this season of our marriage you you can't do what you used to do when we didn't have kids and when we didn't have to worry about maintenancing all that we had and when my job wasn't out of town and when I wasn't traveling as much I haven't taken this into account here's the reason why we divorce before we ever get there here's the reason why we break up before we ever get there here's the reason why we disconnect and fall out of love because in the stay phase and season of our relationship we didn't understand with God that we were supposed to be growing and because we neglected our growth when it came time for a moment of understanding and Clarity of change that needed to take place not for the benefit of you but for the benefit of the person that you have given your heart and your life to you don't have the ability to change because in the stay season you still think it's all about you and the whole time you've been looking for you to be pleased instead of adjusting and asking what do you need from me in this [Music] so you don't understand of what God's called you to do in the season that you're in and you're operating like every season it's the same season if you do not mature and grow you will not be able to when a season change to adjust to the change of the season so that's why you need to know who you are because if your identity is wrapped up in someone making you feel good and like you should feel in every season and you have not learned in the seasons where you were by yourself how to be able to maintain long enough that someone doesn't have to serve you and baby you and look over you at every moment you will lack growth and you will blame other people for where you have not grown in your walk [Music] and you won't understand the assignment [Music] reason you to grow listen we we passed that phase what you want me to do now [Music] what I need you to do is go home and communicate about your season I need you to go home and talk about where you are and where your frustrations are and I need you to be man enough to listen and woman enough to close your mouth to hear one another talk in a Kinder way because my anger is misplaced it's not at you it's at my emptiness and we have got to figure out how to get full again it's a different season that needs a different plan and you need to understand the assignment of where you are if you do not Define it then you'll be immature in the wrong season and you have to do greater work in the season because you lack what you were supposed to do in the other so what you got to do is put on your big boy pants and your big girl pants and say we need to go sit down somewhere let's get some dinner and talk about how we're moving our relationship forward for those of you that are not in a relationship take the time in the stay season to mature and grow as God has called for you to do so that when seasons change you don't get upset and need somebody to pamper you every place you go you can be bold enough and say I've had a season where it's felt lonely like this I don't abandon ship because I don't have what I need in the moment I understand the assignment I pray this will be your life because some of us need to grow up we're more interested in the look of a relationship than the work of a relationship it looks pretty it looks good for date night save your quarters and wait till you're ready [Music] all the front and you did and all the cars you bought and all the houses you bought and she still and he's still not happy it was never about that in the beginning it was about the responsibility for you to grow and mature and find out who you are so that when times and moments hit you don't waver back and forth as if you don't have any stability there's something on the inside of you that's anchored and you can say to God Lord I need you to turn this obstacle into an opportunity but you're not ready to quit you got to understand the assignment God's called you to so I'm telling you if you're single tell God I don't want to move until I'm until you're ready if you're dating go back and say let's make sure we're on the same page do you know who you are you seeking God so he can give you Direction and those of you that are married need to sit down and say we have been frustrated too long what is it that you need [Music] and I believe today when you understand the assignment you understand the season God will bless you abundantly more than you can ask a thing and your relationships will turn all the way around stop caring so much about the outside start taking inventory of the inside if you're single you better enjoy yourself spend your money do what you want that bank account about to get tapped when you're coming amen let's pray okay yeah we're gonna have fun in this series I'm trying to let you know but I just want you to have the best and healthiest relationships possible and I don't want you to get into a place where somebody you get to church and be like they preach God never told me how to live out my relationships in life I want to give you the same advice in the same context as I would give my own children Know Who You Are stop depending on other people to get you to where you need to be stop looking for other people to save you stop looking for other people to be a responsibility single people I love you if you single know who you are you good if you're dating date stop acting like you're a husband and stop acting like you're a wife because that's not what you are I'm just telling you it's gonna be that kind of day and if you marry act like you marry and stop acting like you're single
