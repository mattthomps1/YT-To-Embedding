today God bless you on your way down to your seat just tell your neighbor real quick it is so good to see you oh man it is so good to see you in this place I am grateful I welcome you to the mix my name is Marcus England I'm the lead Pastor here I told our huddle team earlier now that we have a pastor I'm the senior pastor here no I'm just flanking I'm just playing I'm just playing I'm so grateful that uh you're here with us those of you that are online thank you so much for being a part of our family today we just want to get into what God is saying and I'm ready to open this word up James chapter 2 verse 14 and it starts like this it says what good is it if someone says he has faith but does not have works can that faith save him this is a great very great question that is coming out of James James who is the half-brother of Jesus and James is not an original convert meaning he was not one who came to the faith and as close as he was to Jesus he missed him can I tell you often times that you can be close and yet still far but James comes into a realization [Music] that when he understands that Jesus is the Christ the Messiah he takes it on with everything that he has and he says I want to talk about faith but I don't just want to talk about faith by itself that's what we've been talking about do I believe do I believe this thing Beyond Church do I believe this thing beyond what people are telling me am I moving beyond religion to a place of relationship and he says this to him he says if a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in Daily food he says and one of you says to them go in peace be warned and filled without giving them the things needed for the body it says what good is that [Music] he says so also Faith by itself does does not have works it says that faith is dead I said but someone will say you don't have faith and I have works James says show me your faith apart from your works and I will show you my faith by my Works basically the version of what he's saying is talk is cheap [Music] and he goes on to emphasize the point of what I want to bring out today he says you believe that God is one so that's a good thing it's a good thing you do well he says but here's one I want to give you an understanding of there's something we need more than your belief he says for even the demons believe and shudder we're talking about a new level of belief a new level of faith a new place where God is trying to take us here's the topic I want to come from today when believing isn't enough when believing isn't enough can we can we can we just pray father in the name of Jesus I pray that you help us help those of us that have stopped at believing [Music] we're no longer working our faith we're asking our faith to work for us change our minds open our hearts to receive your word in Jesus name somebody say amen amen y'all cannot can I tell you I'm happy this week I'm real happy this week somebody say why because my grandson urmius is turning one years old I am a happy Granddad I'm not gonna lie to you I am so excited and anybody on when you pray you're always really believing that God is going to answer the prayer but then at some times you believe in God's going to answer it in a way that you hope is kind of beneficial I asked the Lord I said father I don't want a born grandchild I said give me a grandson God that I can play with immediately like I need I need to be I don't need him sitting on the side staring at me looking at me just wondering what I said I need some activeness the Lord says you shall have what you asked for and I think the lord gave me a double dose of that blessing you know when you ask God to bless you but he said I'll bless you indeed and enlarge that territory and that joker is running all over my house he is talking words at 11 months and I am just watching this miraculous baby be more than I could ever imagine or think but to see him at this stage last week my wife tries to FaceTime me through what's at because she has an Android hey everybody so as I find that app to get to the Face Time I thought it might have been an out of country I didn't know what it was at first so who's calling me on WhatsApp open my WhatsApp and she has some camera pointed and she says babe look and I said what's going on and she says watch it and he begins to take these little steps over to the couch and I said oh my God this is amazing babe I'm in the middle of a meeting I need to call you back as I watched my grandson start walking I remember somebody say process I remember that he was so eager to walk like when we would hold him and try to walk him in the kitchen in the living room that he would snatch his hands away as if he could walk on his own but the problem is is that every time he snatched his hand away he would fall down and the only way he could begin to get to where he was going is if we were a part of what he was doing he's gotten to the place where he's learning to get on his own but the problem is in his walking he doesn't understand where danger is and so we have steps going up steps going down we got steps going in the middle we got I think it's a house of steps it's just like a it feels like a and and so he's moving everywhere so here's the thing while he can walk he still needs guidance [Applause] it's good to see him walk through the process because I remember when he couldn't move and then I remember when he started moving and then I remember when he started crawling and then I remember when he started pulling up and then I remember when he started trying to walk a little and now I watch him walk and he's talking and I watched the process but most of the time to get the video that I saw I saw him fall it took more Falls in that season of him growing to get to that one moment of walking I remember watching him fall down I remember watching them fall to the side I remember my wife yelling at me because you know as guys we a little bit more let them just you know and she's like he's why would you do that he almost busted his head he didn't so we're good and I walked through the process and watched it and I would let him have a close call and see how far he could go and and we would wrestle and I would get to that and I watched because what was happening was in his growing he was building strength in his legs and he was getting himself at a place in his growth that he could be able to have the strength enough to walk to where he was going to be but he had to build something within in order to do something without and I watched him walk through the process you know what I'm finding today in our lives that we're living that we're calling ourselves Christians and we're starting from baby steps but we're too scared to fall we don't like to listen and we won't walk through process so that we can begin to mature and walk on our own so we stay being infants who are resistant to the father's help and as we understand we're resistant to the father's Health we're always trying to get to a destination on our own without recognizing we need someone to guide us along the way and I feel that what we forget at times is that there's more to our faith than professing it there's more to our faith than saying I go to church I'm at the mix we celebrating seven years y'all I've been saved and I've been baptized James says there's something that happens in your life that's so critical to your growth that if you don't walk through the process of the work being activated with the faith then what you will have the tendency to do is Stop Believing and you'll stop adding Works to your belief see if we want to talk about faith faith is something real that we really need to get into because the Bible lets us know in Hebrews chapter 11 that faith is the substance of things that are hoped for it is the evidence of things that are not seen so what it means is that I have to start believing I have to start moving towards something even though I cannot see the product of it even though I don't see the resources that will impact it and keep it going I must operate somebody say in faith God has called me to operate and face here's the kind of faith that I believe that God is calling us to and James is saying don't you just believe but you need to believe with some works it's the kind of faith that puts us in a perspective to understand that if I'm walking on my own then I'm walking with the dead faith James says there's a dead faith that you have you have a faith but it's dead and I don't know if you're like me but back in the day when when you knew something died it didn't matter if it died in the walls it didn't matter if it died outside when something's dead people notice and when people notice they make a complaint about it anybody ever had something down before I don't know if you had a pet something maybe it was a pet that you didn't know that you had [Applause] what is that bad and it dies and you immediately say what you smell like am I anybody's anybody smell that and you start searching for don't you anybody where's that smell coming from and what you will immediately go to is somethings dead something is dead broken it's something smells and you know what I think the church is looking and saying is it me y'all remember when covet started and some of us are fully in it right now and and and and you remember when they first started saying put your mask going I remember that right and we you you never really walked around with masks going you you never really had that and so I had to start getting used to it and I put the mask on my face and everybody remember after a while of having a mask on you start to smell something anybody smell that what's that smell you smell that no I have a mask on what are you smelling I smell something what do you smell you would eventually get to notice that the thing you were smelling was your own breath and you would be behind that mask and be like oh my God is that is that how I normally smell because oftentimes we had nothing reflecting back to us what we were giving out here's what I believe that the world is looking at the church and they're saying something looks dead I went over there but it didn't really seem to have any power I went over there and everybody seemed to be still walking in the same way I went over there and it didn't really seem to have peeling I went over there and they didn't really seem to have a place where Deliverance could take place I went over there and there were a bunch of people who were in the church but look like the world and people are walking past the church saying something smells and you know what smells it's dead Faith it's a church operating in its own way in its own manner it's people who are followers of Jesus Christ who do not have the faith to believe anymore only the faith to believe in the security of what their job and what everything else can provide around them and they're saying where's the church that's got some real Faith some people that believe against some people that are working off of what they cannot see but some people that are thinking if it is possible then you can do this and they're going to Jesus just like blind Bartimaeus and saying Jesus thou son of David if you would just have mercy on me I may cannot see I may don't understand but if you just open up my eyes yeah that's the Jesus that they're looking for the problem is is oftentimes the church is reflecting a Jesus that looks just like them and they're walking past and saying what's difference you know what the problem is we got dead faith because dead Faith smells dead Faith looks crazy when you walk in and say I'm then there every Sunday but you look and change no different than I change see that's the problem that we're running into is that we've got this broken moment of that we're in it but we're not changed by it because here's the thing you got to understand just because you believe in Jesus like the enemy and the demons do doesn't mean you're being changed by him [Applause] everybody's walking about what they believe in but the problem is is that belief doesn't change your thinking your thinking connected with your belief makes new actions but you'll stay right where you are believing in the Son of God but acting like the one who broke you [Applause] and so what I'm telling you today is not enough to believe anymore because belief won't get you in heaven Jesus said some of you will say I prophesied in your name and the Bible says as you are give our credentials about all of you and say I'm sorry I don't know you I served last week you don't remember me I was in the children's area and I was watching he says listen I want to let you know that the product of what I wanted to do in you was by faith it was not just by what you could do it says the product of your salvation comes out in your works because through your works you become change and renewed and you look like me but the problem is that we've got a church that's believing but not changing and if we can get a church that actually believes and actually has action to their belief oh we got something crazy I just tend to think that if we could get the kind of faith that truly changes the way that we see that if we could get the kind of faith that really explodes in our mind I mean it's the kind of faith that makes you struggle it's the kind of faith that makes you fight within yourself it's the kind of faith that when you look at where you are and where you ought to be you start to get a little disgusted and angry because you said you taught me this is where I would be and this is where I am but I have the faith to endure and believe that I'm walking through the process all right I'm talking about the kind of faith that challenges you can I ask you a question today is your faith challenging you or is your faith convenient for you because things that you do things that you have no clue of how they're going to work challenges you but my question is how is your faith is it dead or alive [Applause] because if you've got some alive faith that means you got something to look towards it's the kind of thing y'all know y'all know the kind of Faith just type your neighbor real quick and say what kind of Faith you got what what kind what what kind what kind of Faith do you have it's the faith that really pursues me and pushes me and says what I see right now is not the end anybody need that kind of faith that faith when you look at yourself and you say this ain't over there's a faith that you got to get mustered up that says this is not the conclusion of what I know to be I know where I'm at but I know what he showed me and I'll hold on to what he showed me more than I hold on to what I can see why because I've learned the definition of faith it is to believe in that in which I cannot see and trust that he's got it all under control you know what balance really is it's keeping your cool when you can't see anything yet you can trust that God is working that's balance I'm willing to trust them over everything the Bible says that James says well what what what does this look like you've got all this Faith you're all into it you you're all connected you're praying you're before God but that's your faith have a work to it that makes you believe enough to do here's the context that I want to let you know is that if you can believe in enough of what God is calling for you to do it will change the very way in which you live out your life and the Very way you live out your life will not stay being the same thing that it's always been looking the same acting the same moving the same having the same attitude tell somebody to massage you real quick it's time for us to grow up here's the context of what I want to give you it's an opportunity for me to mature and to move to somewhere else to stop Clinging On to the baggage the Brokenness the old things that happen and saying to myself I have a faith that's going to change my circumstances I got a faith that'll change my family if I could just hold on for the Bible says be not weary in well-doing in due season ye shall read if you fake not so I've just got to hold on just enough to see it come through I don't know if I've got anybody in here but you may be on your last leg you may be thinking All Is Lost You may be thinking there's nobody beside me but I'm here today to let you know you are not by yourself the Bible says he's with you he's for you he's more than the whole world against you and I tend to believe today James that if I could just tap in long enough that I could see the manifestation of what God wants to do I would watch my life become everything that I see it already big see some of you some of them are disrupted with where you are be because it look like what was you what God showed you and it could actually be the reality of what God is doing then you would say and be a part of the process but the problem is is that you have no hope of expectation so you'll deal and take whatever God wants to be able to give you in that moment and God says I have better for you and say your name real quick there's better there's better there's better ah but I have to get beyond my believing and change my belief to my thinking let me hit you real quick your thinking is jacking you up even when your belief is on point what gets us the most is the way we think because the way in which a man thinketh so is he not the way a man believes because every belief we don't follow through on so that's why when someone tells you I'm a Christian you just be like let's see it more than we need to hear it you don't have to tell me what you are all you got to do is just walk it I'm not interested in trying to convince people of who I am I'm interested in living it out so that the product of it happens in my life so that when I see him he'll recognize me and say oh I remember you why do you remember me because what you said you believe match what you said you would do you know you know what happens real quick is we trust God until it becomes inconvenient and when God put standards on His blessings it becomes an inconvenience because now you cannot manipulate and do with what the blessing you want to do because the blessing was already determined because the purpose was already determined the blessing was not given to you because you just asked for it the blessing was given to you because of the purpose he created you for for the way in which he wanted you to be able to operate for the measure of his good and when you understand it was always for his good then you understand whatever your plan is that you have in life God is already putting it together to say I blessed you not because you deserve a blessing but because it's a part of my plan it's why you've got to understand you'll never be good enough to get what God has for you because you don't have the understanding of what God already preached set up knowing you are already broken that that's why you got to be somebody say grateful got to be grateful because what you're receiving has nothing to do with you it's just God being God and manifesting his plan over your life he couldn't let you die because there was more so that's why we're moving beyond our belief that I believe would move into our actions because everybody can wear a cross everybody can have a morning prayer and everybody can read a scripture but not everybody can be changed because change takes action an action means that God's at work and the question is is God at work in you or is God at work around you because sometimes you enter into the environment of blessing thinking that you are a product of the blessing but all you are is a product of the environment and because the spirit of the Lord is moving you're tapped into the movement but here's how you know that God is still resonating in your life is in the moment where you're disconnected from the environment and the same move of God is taking place in your life without the excess and without the extra added environmental pieces do you still have in presence with God when nobody else is around and there is no worship team do you still have a worship in spirit and in truth when everything is jacked up and you have no way of understanding the question is has your belief taken on work [Applause] so what do we do Pastor you told me my believing's not enough what do I do first thing you're called to do is you're called to call your faith to action some of us our faith is so dead we need to make it rise again can I tell you some of us have been so dependent on ourselves that we are the reason that we are where we are that we don't understand it is all by the grace of God Pastor you don't know how hard I work you don't know how much breath he gave you to do hard work [Applause] so the clarity of understanding is I'm grateful for the faith to believe that God was going to wake me up some of y'all woke up this morning and gave yourself a congratulations because you woke up on time beep I'm up feeling good ready to go anybody know how you feel that I'm ready to go let's get the days some of y'all hit the gym this morning I mean y'all were feeling good the problem is you're the product of God's grace God's grace this morning made the decision to wake you up the decision to wake you up got you into the place where that work could be in actual effect and impact there is no work without no breath no breath means he has ended the opportunity and the possibilities but what I need to let you know is is today he's giving you another opportunity so let's not waste it let's call our faith into action Pastor how do we do that scripture already lets us know Romans chapter 10 verse 17 says it so faith comes by somebody say this word listening my God shall we preach a message on people who do not like listening one thing my grandson that I I love about him is he's so enthusiastic the other thing that they have to break out of him is that he does not like listening he doesn't like to do what his mom and his aunt tells him to do and I hear this often come get your grandson come get your grandson y'all y'all need to get him you need to get him and I get on the phone anybody ever had that moment when you get on the phone you act like you got Authority hey that's how I get on the phone with them you know put a little bit hey what are you doing he looking there and here's how much he fears me when I say that he bust out loud you're crazy man crazy I tell you it's something else man I love you man and I'm looking at him like you don't take me seriously do you I'm gonna nope just want to see what you're gonna do some of us we don't take the father seriously and it's not until we get into our most broken stages it's not until we get to the level where our marriage is on the brink of total Destruction it's not until we find ourselves in the place where we have lost our job we have lost our sanity we have almost lost our lives and then God snatches us back out that we remember if it had not been for the goodness and the grace and the mercy of God I don't know where I would be hear what you must understand you and I are not that smart to get out of the messes that we have made of Our Lives you and I are not that good that we can wiggle our way out that we so cute that we got ourselves out of the situations that we put ourselves and let me help you understand had it not been for the grace of God you would not be sitting where you are standing where you are talking where you are you would be left right in the middle of all of your mess thanks be to God [Applause] ha because you know better than I know but the greater problem is is God knows better than you know what he kept you from here's what I want to let you know today is that God reserved you for a reason and the reason was not you the reason was for his purpose and he's called you to A Life That's fully developed and pulled into a place where your destiny can be finished I feel this today is that the scripture says faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God I believe that some of us have to begin to read out the things the testimony of who God is so that we can revive in ourselves but because what we've become very neutral to is the process that God is boring and I want to let you know that when God looks at your life he's like no you're boring because what he has set you up to do is so beyond what you ever thought possible that that I think about it often how we impress ourselves and we are so so caught up with what we've done that we have no understanding of the greatness of who God has created us already to be and if we understood that we would really be confident in ourselves to be like you don't understand in two years God was about to blow it all up you think I'm dope now just wait in a couple of months when that thing takes off it's going to be crazy but the fact of it is is you think your mere accomplishments that you've done on your own is enough and that the Grandeur that you've hopped on the plane got a better job drama nice a car or have more bedrooms in your house has put you in a place to be able to understand the greatness and the goodness of God well if you understand the faithfulness of how great our God is you would understand that he has things that no eye has seen and no ear is heard and that no mind has conceive what he has for you it's crazy what God has in store for your life if you tapped in where you are at right now is nothing compared [Applause] but you keep saying to yourself I'm killing it and instead of walking by faith you walk by sight anybody ever thought you saw something before but you know you didn't see it and when you got close on it it was a little jacked up anybody ever been there before like you watched something or you've looked at something you've just been like ah I thought that's what I saw I thought the price said 12.99 it actually said 100 and 12 and 99 so anybody ever been there before can I tell y'all something real quick my wife and I we were out on uh we were out together um on on our anniversary and as we were together on our anniversary I'll never forget being a part of a moment where we went into a restaurant and my wife ordered an appetizer that's great enjoy yourself sweetie it's your day I'm just here to serve you I just I just want to be connected in whatever you want to do the problem was is that when we don't understand and we don't see well or we don't take the time to understand and see well we we're misguided in the amount of information that we really have and will fall into a pit the funniest thing was is we were opening the menu at the restaurant and it says the starters well if you're like me starters means it's under 20 dollars somebody say Amen that's what it's supposed to be we're starting we have not ended we're starting she opens the menu and she says oh my gosh yes this is great babe yeah and she orders now because both of us come somewhat from the same place starters for us means the same thing it's where you start not where you're in we know the main entree is going to be a place where you're in we know the starter is the place where you begin if you start too high you go in really high so we need to start low so we can work up to get there she goes and she orders these three shrimp it's like tiger shrimp but we're in Mexico so as she's looking at how much it costs when you start to look at it you're looking at pesos and you're like oh 2300 pesos you're like oh that's just you know conversion right you know how to convert I don't think my wife looked at the price and I know she didn't convert because when it went to the starter she picked the three shrimp and they came out and I was like my goodness anybody ever looked at something and you know something's wrong [Applause] you've been there before something 's off this is no way no way no way and she orders it and she's like this is filling this is amazing I love this I I said well it is I don't know if they get jealous of people fool but I got jealous I said I should have ordered that and I've heard the Holy Spirit or the cheapness inside of me whatever it was whatever it was I wasn't able to tell the difference that fast it said that's not under twenty dollars when I looked at it I went back to the menu and I went back up in the area and I said let me convert y'all I pulled out my phone when I saw the conversion I set my phone down and I told my wife I said you're done for today [Applause] excuse me you're done for today what are you talking about why would I be done for today I said you're done for today because you just ordered a 75 dollar starter I said you have nowhere else to go [Applause] that's it you've hit your limit you're out of here she said it costs how much I said 75 dollars in the middle of that the waiter comes over and asks are you ready to order I said no we're ready for the check we're done she looked at me and said I never knew and I wanted to get another one I said do you understand what I'm saying this is expensive the way she was looking at it she didn't have all the information I want to tell you about your life today is that you're at a decent place but you don't have all the information and if you had all the information to whom God created you to be you would not stop nor would you take the bare minimum of what this world has been offering you you would weigh out and say there is a greater blessing in store for me here's what I want to tell you as you call your faith into action there will be some things you will be denied from there will be some places that will not accept you but it's all somebody say it's a part of the plan my failures are part of the plan the denial is a part of the plan the rejection is a part of the plan why because he has better in sore for me I don't have all the information that's why he has to lead the way the Bible lets us know you're not to lean to your own understanding it says in all your ways somebody say oh your ways you are to acknowledge God and he will direct your path you don't have all the information so as you resurrect your faith you call it into action ask the Lord what's next second thing you call to do is work your faith somebody say work your faith James chapter 1 verse two through four says this consider it pure Joy my brothers and sisters whenever you face Trials of many kinds he says because I want to let you know this trial that you're going through right now I'm speaking to somebody this trial that you are in the middle of that you are going through that you are fighting your way out of that you don't understand why it's so severe it says this trial is not just there to be a trial God is not playing with your emotions he's not trying to get you riled up it says this thing is there and testing your faith because your faith in its testing produces perseverance see you can't handle what God has for you if you don't have any perseverance because the weight of the blessing is too great for you to be able to handle by yourself so he needs to test the faith so that you can purr severe it says and let perseverance finish somebody say finish somebody say finish let perseverance finish some of you are asking for blessings and you haven't finished the course some of you are asking for things when you haven't walked through the process of time it says let it finish it's work so that what happens you can have more blessings nope so that you can tell how many people how many places no so you can tell them all the things you sold note it says so that you may be what mature and what complete some of us are some of the most blessed incomplete and immature people we have ever met that's why every blessing you squander it it doesn't matter if it's a PPP loan an lll loan or mmm loan it don't matter what it is you will Jack it up why because you are not mature and complete and every time you get it you waste it away you don't know what to do with the opportunity you don't have wisdom enough to know timing you're not in your head enough to understand that God's telling you to wait why because you're operating out of what you feel not out of what God has said and it says when you operate in timing you'll lack nothing when you're in a season of lack it means you're not in your time yet so if I'm lacking I need to wait because more maturity needs to take place and more completion needs to take place here's the greatest thing that will keep you from working your faith is being in the environment in the places with people who do not want to mature and be completed with you they will always tell you to settle I'll just know let me show you what to do look at where you at because it doesn't seem like your faith has produced much as well because you know their faith by their what some of us are taking into account what people say out of a strong relationship and not out of the evidence that they produce [Applause] tell me about wealth you broke [Applause] you're asking your friend and they ain't even where you at I'm just asking how you gonna ask another couple that's not even married about your marriage no we need to be mature and we need to be somebody say complete on point number three repeat your faith wash [Music] repeat what does the scripture say pass Romans Chapter 5 Verse 3 through 4 says this not only so but we also glory in our sufferings Paul sounds like he has lost it all who in the world will glory in their sufferings that's some bible stuff that's some feel-good stuff that's some yeah that's weird Nobody Does that money Glory's in there suffering you know what we do in our suffering we go to the areas that soothe us we pick back up the addiction we go back to the area of isolation we start walking in our old past again we start living out the Brokenness and we no longer see our faith at work but you gotta suffer through something to get somewhere you gotta walk through some pain you gotta feel the sense of what it is to be uncomfortable because in order for your faith to work again you're going to have to go through pain again and your body needs to get used to denying itself so Paul writes as he's in Corinth to those in Rome who are still yet being persecuted for their beliefs he says this suffering produces what's that word again perseverance there's something it must be about persevering [Music] because I think most of us quit so early Paul started noticing we all start but nobody finishes it says that suffering produces perseverance and then he says this perseverance produces character [Music] I know a lot of hard workers I don't know a lot of people with character I know a lot of people that got the grind I don't know a lot of people with character character means you go through something and you make a decision even though you have another pathway you could go you determine within yourself through faith I can't see it but I believe if I stick with him he will make all things new some of you can't understand right now why you're suffering [Music] he says I'm trying to teach you perseverance and then that perseverance comes some character you stop making up stuff you stop trying to impress others you start being a man and a woman of your word you stop being inconsistent and start being consistent you start locking in with your purpose and the destiny that God sets over your life you stop being so wishy you have a firm foundation somebody can trust on you somebody can depend on you your word means something now you're not just here for fun you're not the one we call when we just want to let loose you're the one we call when all hell is breaking loose because you've got a firm foundation [Music] he says perseverance produces some real character and then character produces some hope the reason why some of us have lost hope because we didn't persevere if you persevere you'll get the hope and guess what the hopes will say I can do this thing [Music] this is somebody tell your neighbor real quick it's not over if I could just go through it if it could just build who I am and if I could just get a little bit of hope I can believe again and watch God do it again and then I step back into a new Faith situation and I do it all over again and I say if I can believe it and I can hold on and if I could just be built up a little bit more it means I can have a little bit more hope and I go back to Faith and then I take it all over again and it says if I can do this thing and I start to have the faith to believe not just for myself but for my children and my children's children and everything around me I can can change my community I can change the world I start to believer here's the problem you have been persevered long enough to have any character you got shoddy character we can't trust what you say we can't trust you being honest and God says in order for me to be able to give to you what I have got to be able to trust you with what you have right now God says I'm not here to tell you to give you another thing until you can persevere with what you already have [Music] you persevere with that I'll build your character because now it means your character is in a place that the blessings that you get won't be squandered because there is a integral part of you that won't allow it to go to waste and then the integral part of you will build such a place of hope and that place of hope will now bring forth another piece of Faith but some of us are only faithful to the things that benefit us foreign so why we believe our believing isn't enough to change us stay right where we are but today I tend to believe I got a couple people in here [Music] you just got a hair ounce of Faith fluffy you just like I'm gonna call this Faith to action I'm gonna work my faith and I'm gonna repeat it again anybody ready to believe God again for the things that look like they were over and done with Taylor you just was like I don't know I I'm here today to let somebody know yeah you don't know and you won't know so what you got to start doing is trusting God and believing today by faith that everything that he has promised is already Yes and a man
