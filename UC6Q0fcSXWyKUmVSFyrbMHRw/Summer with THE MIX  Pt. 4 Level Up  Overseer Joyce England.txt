overseer here at the mixture [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] now i want to honor our pastor today that's not here but he is working in the kingdom pastor marcus england and his wife semesia england and it's by his request that i'm here this morning so you pray for me also i want to honor the dream team here at this church the volunteers here at this church the paid staff here at this church the musicians here at research the singers those that give out cards those that give us ice cream outside and snowballs we honor you this morning we thank you because we know it takes a lot to produce this atmosphere that you're in today we thank you and we greet you in the name of the lord look i'm going to share something with you that happened to me i was [Music] just straight off the bat and we're going to go into the message i i was asked to commit to something and please position the scriptures because we're going there next hours asked to commit to something and and they asked me you know there's this program we would like you to commit to it would you commit to it maybe it'll be six to eight weeks and [Music] uh you know we will give you um a stipend for doing this but would you would you commit to it and i thought about it and it's something that i do anyway and so i said yes i'll commit to it i will and once the first week started with the program and there were people that came that i didn't know now i can be borderline um introvert it depends on the situation and so i wasn't as um you know sometimes i'm just out there bubbly oh hi my name is joyce what's your name what do you do i don't usually come that way i'll say hi how are you and then maybe wait for you to say something and then hope you can keep pumping it so that then i get comfortable enough but this time i was leading this and so i had to be able to move with it and i started talking to the different ones i made it my business i put the effort in i went out of my comfort zone i said let me start knowing who these individuals are that would come out this time of morning and and connect and i just started asking and talking and found out this person did this this person did that it was just a group of people that did all kinds of things and they were very kind and so now i'm four weeks in and i was talking to one of the people that had started a relationship with and she said to me you know i do this person's hair and they sit on the board of the company that you know funds this program and i said okay and i happen to tell them that i'm a part of and i really like it and you know she said and so i just wanted to tell you that and you're doing a good job and it made me feel so good and then my mind started clicking because i got a text that said hey joyce are you interested in doing this program extending it if so let me know because i think we can get some more funding my mind shifted i had made a relationship with this young lady she in turn knew somebody that held the purse strings that in turn caused the call to go to the one that asked me to do the program in the beginning and said look we're gonna fund it as long as you want if you want to do the spring you want to do the fall you want to do the summer and i said oh wow you know there are benefits to relationships now you can pull back if you like and you can say you know i really don't want to put that effort in that time in you you you can but i want to share with you today as the church of the lord jesus there's benefits in in really committing to relationships now their relationships and then there are relationships there's commitments and then there are commitments so i'm in a commitment sometimes as long as it benefits me once i see that that's not benefit i'll say this term i'm out anybody ever said that i'm out because it's not benefiting me and then there are other times that i go into a relationship and i commit and i may get into it for uh just just just for i think that's what the other person wants i'm trying to please somebody have you ever done that you're into something because you don't want to make the other person upset about not being in it you don't really want to tell the truth that i really don't like what this is that i'm in but i'm in it because you're pressuring me so there are times where we're committed in that sense but there are the times when we are fully committed fully fully meaning you know whatever it takes however it looks whatever i have to invest whatever i have to do i'm going to put myself in it and so today i want to talk about being fully committed and i have a question that i wanted to put out there and it is are you fully committed we want to talk about the relationship that you have with the lord right now are you fully committed to it and and if you are what are the benefits what what is it that you should even consider about being fully committed in this relationship can we can we deal with that this morning let me pray and then let's read the scripture father we have this moment in time that you already knew would be here you knew who would be in this place you have the knowledge of all things today we cannot do anything without you we need your direction we need you to show us we need you to help us we just need you in every area of our life meet us here today please meet us because i want our lives to be changed that's what the mix is about a group of people coming together to change lives and change the world and so if we're going to do that we need your perspective we need your your energy we need your wisdom and your power help us today someone here needs you they're right on the precipice of of making a decision of getting ready to do something that they need to hear your voice about they've been touring with it and pushing and thinking but they really need to know what do i need to do help us this morning and we will so give you praise and so give you honor in jesus name let's read the scripture you had your bibles or if you're going to read the prompter we understand our pastor always says that what no takers are right no takers or world changes and readers are do you believe that yes okay so you're either taking those or reading right go with me this morning i'm i'm going to be what i what i have to share with you as they may say on tick-tock that i'm going to spill the tea about what i'm going to spill the tea about today is very important but i'm not going to take all day to do it you know how they do online i got to spill the tea i'm like you've been seeing that for 20 minutes feel it i don't have all day i only got two seconds on this post come on steal it but yes i'm going to spill this yeah i'm going to share some things that are life-changing today so just stick with me and the question again is what what did i say the question was are you fully committed are you fully committed and if you are not fully committed then i need you to level up now y'all probably saying she look at tick tock everything oh look at all that stuff yeah i do sometimes but i do like to meet my audience where they are going to understand where i'm coming from we if you're not committed then i just want you to consider leveling up today okay say level up okay let's have a look i like somebody like the duck on the end have a look so let's read this word of god bless your name jesus it's first samuel you're probably going have it first samuel 17 32-37 let's go david said to saul let no one lose heart on account of this philistine your servant will go and fight him saul replied you're not able to go out against this philistine and fight him you're only a young man and he has been a warrior from his youth but david said to saul your servant has been keeping his father's sheep when a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock i went after it struck it rescued the sheet from his mouth when it turned on me i seized it by its hair struck it and killed it your servant has killed both the lion and the bear this uncircumcised philistine will be like one of them because he has defiled the armies of the living god the lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the part of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this philistine saul said to david go and what and the lord be with you when i came out this morning i made a declaration i said the lord is with you remember that and i don't know if you really got it or embraced it but i want you to keep that in your mind so as we move through this this message this morning that it will come back to you and that it will resonate and that it will take root in you and you will you will say to you not your neighbor that to you the lord is with me the lord is with me that makes a difference and so let me bring you to what's happening here in this story we have the nation of israel god's people god is the king of these people he is the lord of these people and they in turn belong to him they are part of his kingdom he is in a covenant relationship with them there are some promises that are involved in the covenant there is a order that is involved in a covenant or an agreement there is a structure to a covenant or an agreement all of those things are very important and and these are the people of god that understand they're under this oath this covenant this agreement and they look to god yahweh jehovah god elohim many names we call him but they look to him for everything so unlike it may be for us sometimes they didn't just go to church on sundays or entertain god that at just different times god was the center of their life what they ate what they wore where they went who they fraternized with what they did with the poor what they did when somebody did something wrong every aspect of their life was embedded in god being the center of it as opposed to those that around them they worshipped many gods but you see in that scripture again david says we worship the living god something about our god being living isn't it i want a living god i don't want a dead god i don't want a god that's not relatable i don't want a god that that can't hear me i don't want a god that if i'm praying i don't know if he's hearing me or not hear me i don't want a god that can't do anything about my desperate situation i don't want a god that cannot help me when my country is in despair and and tore upside down and it seems like no hope because the politicians are on their own side they're sure not on ours i need a guy that can that i can talk to that can hear me that would feel me that would care about me that would answer my prayer he doesn't have to do it in a conventional way i don't care how he does it but when i pray i need him to hear me [Music] i need him to hear me and so that's what a living god does as opposed to an idol god and so david is part of this community and he is a young man that washed the sheep for his father there were eight brothers he watched the sheep and the scripture says that he was handsome he was ruddy you know he had that outdoorsy kind of look nothing wrong with that right it said he could play the lyra and and it said that he was he was bold he he was a warrior all those things sound pretty good and the king that they had in place of israel at this time was saul and saul had had disobeyed god on several occasions it's just so important that we obey the voice of the lord he disobeyed god on several occasions and the lord had told sam the prophet i have rejected him i want you to go to where i tell you to go and i want you to anoint for the oil on this man here and when you pour it this is going to be our next king because he has my heart david was known to be one that had the man that had the heart of god it didn't say david was perfect it said he had the heart of god it didn't say david didn't do any wrong because we see what he did but he still had a heart for god we see it in the writings when we look at psalms how david says lord look don't don't don't put me away from you do anything but don't take your spirit from me you know clean me because i didn't messed up again but just don't take your spirit from me please i need you and so he had that kind of relationship and so we see that david is experiencing these things on the back side of the mountain the the samuel comes and he sees all the sons of jesse but the sons of jesse that came wasn't the son that god wanted to anoint to make king sometimes we look at people's outward appearance and think surely he's the king look at him surely surely she has it together that's got to be but never thought about the one that was on the back side of the mountain that was not six feet tall that did not have a six-pack lord had mercy okay that just did not look the part and when he went to put all of them the scripture says the lord said to him samuel i didn't call none of them seven does he have another son i won't move from this part and tell you find another son they went and got him from watching the sheep brought him in and then it said the oil flowed on david my god that's how the lord looks at us sometimes we think it's her because she got it all together and he's got it all together and they got it all together and god is saying i don't care about how much they got it together i want you i know your background but i want you i know what you've done but i still want you i want you and he anointed him and he was to be the next king it didn't happen right away but he was keep that in mind and so david goes back to his job doing what he does and then the the israelites fight with the philistines they worship many gods there was this tension and where we are in the scripture today david's brothers had gone to the battlefield and they were there to line up with on the other side of the mountain with the philistines because they were going to go to war david's father sends him to go take some provisions to his brothers find out how things are going bring me back a report david is obedient remember i talked about that again must be a reason why i'm saying that david was obedient he didn't say why can't you get somebody else my job is to wash the sheep see i feel like going i gotta ride like i found somebody else to wash the sheet it didn't say he said that it said he obeyed his father got the provision went and took the food there while he is there this philistine this giant comes out and he begins to taunt and to defy and be disrespectful and to openly resist the people of god and say send one down i'll fight them and if i be then y'all serve us if they be then you serve us right and so that was the proposition this giant came out 40 days 40 days morning and evening 40 days do you know things can to intimidate you in this world over and over and over for a long period of time do you know that in the intimidation it feels like sometimes that eventually you're going to give in 40 days morning and evening the philistine came and said send somebody out what do you do what kind of gods you serve david is there and he hears it i'm already telling you david's in a relationship with the lord right i already tell you david's already have this faith in this trust because god has delivered him out of the hands of the tight the lion and the bear right i'm already telling you he knows something about faith in god i'm already telling you that and david is then he hears it and i i want to show you three things that came to mind because i've always looked at this and said lord show me how show me how to have that kind of fierceness that he had you know i don't want to be scared of everything i want there to be a fierceness there with me no matter what's happening even if my world is troubling even if you leaving me and never coming back i still want to be able to say it that's everything i know is crumbling and turns and breaks down i still want to be able to stand so he's here and he he hears it and these are the three characteristics that we're going to tell you about when we are fully committed how it will change our lives this was the first thing when we are fully committed we will see things differently let's see things differently look look at this there is a change of perspective when we are fully committed david asked the men standing near him no i'm sorry it says this david yes the men standing near him what will be done for the man who kills this philistine and removes this disgrace from israel then he goes on to say who is this uncircumcised philistine that should defy the armies of the living god the scripture when you read it says whatever the giant came out everybody ran david sees the giant and said who is this uncircumcised philistine we seeing the same thing but you coming from a whole different perspective you're seeing it a whole different way i'm crowding down saying oh lord what are we going to do you know inflation's up gas is up jesus what we're going to do i can't even buy milk from my baby they don't even have no the formula what are we gonna do david goes and says who's stopping up the source how are we going to find the loose fist stuff up here so we can live he has another perspective when you are fully committed and he was fully committed to god and had the heart of god he says who is this uncircumcised philistine that we pay him any attention you will see it differently somebody else will say if i were you i wouldn't somebody else has said you within your right not to do that somebody else always want to tell us something don't they but if we would have an ear to the voice of god when we are fully committed god will speak to your heart he'll give you a strategy he'll give you a plan he will stir up in you so much that the people around you going to be impacted where they may have been terrified they may have been depressed they're saying well look he got a little something going on well you know we can get let's connect with him he got a little strength he look you know she's not scared let me get with her when we are fully committed people should be able to glean from your strength they should be able to glean from the way you see it i had some people talk to me about decisions that i have been planning to make and i keep seeing i could keep going back and forth because i i felt like i had the clarity but then when it came time to do it's like i'm gonna show you clarity that's my time then the script then i looked and the lord was just saying to me if you don't hear me if i'm not clear then don't you make a move that became very clear to me you don't hear me if you're not clear then don't make a move i'm talking to somebody this morning you don't hear me you're not sure you're still contemplating and struggling with it then don't move he's got another way he's got another answer he's telling to tell you follow my my path go with me i'm with you we in this coming agreement i'm going to take you somewhere and maybe going through this is going to change your life so i got you there even though you could get out of that hot spot sit there because i'ma change your life through it i'm gonna do something for you that nothing else can do it unless you follow me and sit there you know we don't want to sit nowhere sit there it's not your decision the decision is the lord's over our life we don't know what god's going to do david came there to feed the people and he did not know god was setting him up to take the kingship you hear me this morning you're going somewhere doing something because that's what you think to do and god has already went before you to set you up to set you in a place of privilege and authority and joseph said that you meant it for one thing but god meant it that many souls would be saved say hallelujah come on say hallelujah like you mean i need some people with some power here i need to feel your energy your spirit this morning so that's the first technique that we see things differently there's a change of perspective number two we are emboldened we become emboldened when we become fully committed we take authority we we we take um we invest in it and we really become one with what this thing is and so the scripture says look david asked the men but we've already read that where's my home screen oh here we go david said to saul let no one lose heart on account of this philistine your servant will go and fight him period period period don't lose heart your servant got this don't lose heart we're gonna make it mama don't worry don't lose heart we we got this here don't lose heart don't lose her he spoke with authority he spoke with power he spoke with like he knew where his health was coming from and that was the issue he knew where he was his help was coming from he knew the way he was speaking speaking wasn't out of his own self he was speaking out what he knew god could do i need you to become emboldened when you look at your family and don't like what you see i need you to become rolling when you look at your husband and you don't like what you see i need you to come embolden when you're on your job and you don't like what you see not always i'm out i'm here god placed me here i'm not moving now what's going to change who one came this is a blessing god gave to me i'm going to forfeit my blessing you may leave but i'm here to kill the giant you need to slay the giant you just start thinking about slaying your giant what's your giant this morning talk to me what's your driving this morning addiction the slave addiction huh i'm not playing with it no more addiction [Applause] speaking speaking she's not speaking it out of her own strength because we don't have enough strength when addiction has holes i know what i'm talking about it's not like we could just say oh today i'm going to be addicted we are out of control there are things going on and uh going on in that what neurologically they're going on in us physically then our bodies just don't shut down and say oh we won't be a dick addict anymore it's not your control by this but i know a god that can break every hole every addiction free us from sin shame i know a god that's real and living and wants to do it for you you better get bold if you're going to get both sometimes you better get bold now you better get both you start speaking different i need you to speak different don't come to me whispering nothing speak up i can't hear you [Applause] i asked you this man i said to you this morning the lord is with you i heard the people that the lord is with me what was that what was that the lord is with me who i don't think nobody with you uh no i need to go this side the lord is with you is the lord with you is the lord with you is he with you what about you and what about you yes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah bless his name we're almost there we're on the last one so you become emboldened you see things differently third characteristic of somebody that has has become fully committed we take action say that to yourself take action take action i can take action because the lord is with me i can take action because he has shown me what is really before me not what i think and not what somebody told me but what is really before me i can take action because he has empowered me [Applause] i'm going to read the script it to you it's going to blow your mind this morning he has empowered you to take action it's not by your strength it's not by your your philosophy it's not about the program that you're working we need programs but it's by my spirit says the lord. look we take action then he took his staff in his hand chose five smooth stones from the stream put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and with his sling in his hand approached the philistine walked with me this morning as the philistine moved closer to attacked him david ran quickly towards the battle line to meet him that's crazy talk he ran quickly towards the philistine he took action he ran towards him the army ran away from him david ran towards him [Music] what do you need to be running towards today stop running away from it the lord is with you lord is with you a giant lies in your path today what goliath is taught taunting you and telling me you you're not worth it you can't do it you never have been you never will be you don't measure up you don't have the goods you don't look like it you don't come from the right place how many times did that intimidate you they would say who are you those circumcised philistines that you would come to defy the army of the living god this morning i need to ask the question again are you fully committed that's what you have to look at that's what you're going to have to think about that's what you need to bring through your mind because if you are god's going to do his part god's going to change your life there's going to be a fusion that comes god won't be on the side just throwing you a few little things that help you along the way but he's gonna come and connect and that is gonna change you because you will be in him and he will be in you [Music] the girl says on the sign on uh run up tick-tock i'm gonna be with you you're gonna be with me or we're gonna be together there's no options we're gonna be together so i can be with you you can be with me i know it doesn't make sense right that's how i look too when i first heard it or we can be together what she was saying is you ain't got no options [Music] you have the options we're going to be together when god calls us and we say yes then he comes in and he bonds with us and he starts changing our lives you're not the same that's why you don't see the same you're not the same that's why you don't act the same you're not the same because you become bold in the power of the lord and in his life say hallelujah are you fully committed are you fully committed come on today are you fully committed that's what god has said come come come behold i stand at the door and now and if anybody would come open the door and let me in i will commune with you i'm going to talk to you i'm going to show you because i have a real love for you i'll talk to you and you will talk with me if we're going to see changes here in our nation it's going to be through the church [Music] stop waiting for somebody to wake up and make sense and say oh lord we're doing these people so wrong so i'm waiting for that start waiting for somebody to come in on the white horse and change them somewhere for that you will connect with her she will connect with him the body of christ will connect we're going to see the landscape the way god sees it we're going to become emboldened we're not going to be in the background just going to our churches and not doing anything but we're going to take both steps
