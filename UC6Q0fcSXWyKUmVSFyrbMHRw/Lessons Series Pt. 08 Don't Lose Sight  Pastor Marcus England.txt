[Music] here's what i believe god just laid on my heart as our worship team was ministering is that someone came in expectation today but you didn't know how you were going to do what you're expecting god to do and what i believe in this moment is that there is something that was spoken that was prophetic prophetic meaning something that was spoken to a place that you may not even know or clarity and understanding about and what i believe there's there's a release today that somebody needs in this place that's not waiting on god but god is waiting on you and what i believe in this moment that you have the ability to be able to do is speak something to yourself that i want to let you know no one else is going to speak to you in this moment and here's what i believe that you need to speak and declare within yourself that will bring a freedom in your life today i believe you need to declare and speak this a couple of times to yourself and say i am enough just say it again i am enough i am enough just begin to believe it in your spirit and start to say it over and over i am enough i know what my past look like but i am enough i know what my bank account says but i am enough i know what people spoke about me but i am enough i know what my circumstances look like but i am enough devil you thought you had me but i am enough you thought you were going to kill me but i am enough you thought you were gonna keep me bound but i am enough and you start speaking over yourself i am enough i am healed i am delivered i am set free because you've got to speak something over your life and until you believe it the manifestation of what god wants to do cannot happen so i want you to declare it all day when the moment of doubt sinks in when depression is trying to creep in when your old ways are trying to poke their head up just tell somebody beside you say i am enough i'm sorry i know i should be encouraging you but i've got to encourage you to encourage me first so tell somebody else on the other side say i am enough can you find your third choice and say third choice i just want to let you know today i am enough anybody that know that enough can you give god a hand praise in this place for how great our god is god bless you god bless you god bless you when you believe it you'll praise him when you receive it you'll praise him when you know what god wants to do for you you'll go right in that moment and say i am enough i declare it over my life i declare it over my family i declare it over everything i walk into i am enough god says i am the head and not the tail i am above and not beneath i'm blessed in my going out and my coming in somebody give god a praise in this place [Music] all right take your seat it's sunday morning it's not worship night have a seat [Music] god bless your worship team thank you come on have your seat in this place [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to the mix church my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i welcome those of you that are here in person those of you that are online we say welcome from all over the country those of you that have visited us even recently that have been a part we we celebrate you um what i believe is that often times we're coming to church with an expectation from god when truly the expectation is from ourselves because there's a shift somebody say a shift it's a shift that has to happen in us in order for there to be the true change that we want to see god to do and so i don't want you coming in only just needy for god what i want you coming in is needy for god to do in you what you already have the ability to see him do there are some things that god is saying is no more prayer that's needed there is no more time on your knees that's needed you just need to activate that in which i've already spoken inside of you and allow that to be declared through your life today and so that's why i wanted to speak that over your life which is you've got to be able to speak it and get it again i am enough i am enough monday morning i am enough tuesday i am enough tuesday evening i am enough wednesday i am enough i know what's going on i know how i feel i know what people said i know what got me worked up but thursday morning repeat it to yourself i am enough if you're older like me when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night just declare it i am enough you

out to everyone that was a part everyone who donated everyone um that just was a big instrument in helping us serve over 120 people on yesterday at our thanksgiving giveaway can you give yourselves a hand thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you oh such an impact uh over 400 families impacted so every turkey went into a family not just to an individual and so we saw that families were impacted we saw it so much and the need was so great that we literally still had cars coming once we ran out and so we told people you can check us out again this monday we will be here on tomorrow here at 1725 and we'll be giving out more turkeys and more fresh produce boxes why is that important because fresh produce is impactful into our communities because fresh food helps the health of our body as a community and so we're grateful not to just only and i'm not against it but not to just only be passing out canned things we're able to pass out fresh things that can impact the people that you know we're having thanksgiving with so we're so grateful for that if you want to be a part of volunteering if you still want to give you have the opportunity to do so as they say you can check out

got people signed up baptisms are next sunday come on and then the second thing is is it's worship night next week and uh if you know like i know what god does at worship night you will be there and be square and we're excited about that today um i'm also grateful for those that who are uh finishing up our growth track we've had a great group of people that have joined the church and are a part of uh coming in to make a difference and make an impact so we're grateful for our growth track and i'm just excited about all that god is doing here at the mixon excited not just about a number i'm excited about how god's using you to make an impact and difference in the world and we're so grateful can we open our bibles uh to judges chapter 16 judges chapter 16 and uh if you are here we believe that note-taking can be transformative in your life and so here at the mix we say that note-takers are what we are world changers can you let somebody know beside you real quick you're a world changer so get your notes out no i'm just playing don't do it don't talk to him like that you in church don't do that be kind as my wife says to our grandson who was he was going on two months be kind i said he don't want to be kind he wants some milk so he ain't got that judges chapter 16. this is a story of a man by the name of samson one who is a nazarite he has the strength that god has given him to be one who is a protector of israel the idea is that samson strength lies not in his hair but in his obedience it's not in the thing it's in the obedience to god that samson strength lies in and so samson's responsibility that was given to his parents is that not a uh razor shall touch his head his obedience gives him strength his strength gives him the ability to be a judge this is a time in israel before there are kings uh samson is a judge amongst the people and he has a strength and he's defeating the enemy samson finds himself in the place where we're getting to that someone's trying to figure out what's his strength here's what i want to let you know is that there are people that are watching your life that are trying to figure out how you are getting where you're getting to they want to know your strength they want to know what what has gotten you to this place what has gotten you the advancement what's gotten you the the promotion what's got you the the husband what's gotten you sir the wife what what has put you in the place of such blessings and the bible says that he was so blessed i don't know if you ever been so blessed that people just get aggravated with you you walk in the door what you doing man i got another blessing to share oh my goodness again oh samson was so favorable in the eyes of god that samson found himself at a place where they were sending anything they could to be able to take away samson's shrimp that's why in scripture we understand the scripture in john 10 and 10 where it says the thief comes to steal to kill and to destroy the bible lets us know that there's a woman by the name of delilah delilah if you have a woman by the name of delilah be careful that name sounds suspicious what's your name delilah nope i want no dealings with you delilah provokes and moves and and consistently asks samson where is the power of your strength and samson in his very literal sense says it's in my hair but the truth of the matter was it was in his obedience and when samson's hair is cut samson loses his strength and the enemy that he's been fighting all of his life and conquering finally gets a hold of him the enemy does not care how long he has to go after you all he is just waiting for is you just to slip up one time so he can get your strength and the bible pulls us to this point in verse 23 that we're going to read to verse 31 of what happens at the end of samson's time and moment the bible says starting at verse 23 now the lords of the philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to dagon their god and to rejoice and here's what they said our god has given us samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their god little g god for their said our god has given our enemy into our hand the ravager of our country who has killed many of us and when their hearts were married they said call samson that he may entertain us the world is oftentimes looking for the church to fail [Music] because it needs something to be entertained by you say god is great you say god is powerful that's why the world surrounds when a man or woman of god fails or falls in a moment because the world has always been watching to go against what god has already declared to be great [Music] it says that when their hearts are married so they called samson out of the prison and he entertained them they made him stand between the pillars and samson said to the young man who held him by the hand let me feel the pillars in which the house rests that i may lean against them it says the house was full of men and women the lords of the philistines were there and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women who looked on while simpson entertained and samson called the lord and said oh lord god please remember me please strengthen me only this once oh god that i may be avenged on the philistines for my two eyes they took out samson's eyes the enemy is trying to take your sight [Music] he's trying to take what you had vision for he's trying to take what god showed you about yourself he's trying to steal the the vision of what god spoke over you that thing that you saw that was a glimpse that you couldn't believe that could possibly be you god is trying to let you know that's you but the enemy is trying to steal your sight it says and samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested and he leaned his weight against him his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other and samson said let me die with the philistines and then he bowed all his strength and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it so the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those in whom he killed during his life then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and ashtaal in the tomb of manoa his father and he had judged israel 20 years [Music] i want to use for a title today write this down don't lose sight don't lose sight can we pray father in the name of jesus we pray today god that you would help us not to lose our sight of what you've already shown us about who you've called for us to be father i pray today that as this word is received into our hearts it will not only be received into our hearts but god it would also be what we operate out of and we do in this moment that we will be a pliers of this word in this season of our life in jesus name we say amen amen here's here's what i believe people of god thank you so much musicians thank you uh for playing also i just want to give a huge can we give a loud clap to those that are part of our dream team our volunteers here can y'all help me celebrate them real big come on celebrate them celebrate them celebrate them big big [Applause] they are the mvps of our church thank you guys so much those of you that are even online thank you so much for what you do here's what i believe if if if we're called not to lose sight then what are we doing if we're called not to to lose sight of this this idea that god has for our life then then what are you focused on the question today is what are you focused on in your life are you focused on what god has spoken have you are you focused on on on material things are you focused on on where you're going in your career are you focused on what's next in your life tell me today what are you focused on what is your life built upon what is this moment of where you are what is life focused on are you focused on ladies trying to get a man fellas are you focused on trying to get a move my question today that you gotta write down is what am i focused on because what i'm focused on will be what i move towards what i'm focused on will be what i moved in and and operate on in my life i'm here because i believe what you're focused on will give you direction to where you are going the bible lets us know that that we're we're in a space and time where focus is so important where where so many things can distract you anybody know that there's something always trying to get your attention something always trying to pull at you anybody know about the algorithm gods if you if you if you've googled something and you go on social media if you go on a website do you know that the website that you're on now shows up on your social media thread anybody ever been there before you was looking at some shoes and then all of a sudden you're on facebook looking at the same pair of shoes trying to figure out is the government watching me who's looking at me who's who's watching me who's trying to figure out because what i'm trying to let you know is that if you do not have a focus someone will give you one to work with the question today is what are you focused on i think reading in this scripture we find out that samson had been focused for a long time yet he had been he had been in towards what he was supposed to do samson was a great man the bible says he was so great that he found himself in the place where he killed a hundreds of men with the jawbone of a donkey can you imagine what god would do with your life if you were just obey do you understand that god has so much in store for you and it's not about what is seen on the outside it's just about somebody say obedience obedience is so important why because what god is trying to do is keep you in perspective and in alignment so that you can follow along to his ways and not get lost in your own we find samson at a place where he he's gotten distracted anybody know he he finds himself i make up the picture that that delilah is is is in this place with samson and and and and samson's head is laid upon delilah and they're up in the rooftop deck and they're living life and she's stroking him and saying samson what is what is your strength what what what would happen if if if if the enemies came against you what would slow you down the bible says that samson goes about telling her different lies so that she would not know his strength i'm here because i think the devil is just trying to wear you out you you you fought him the first time you fought him the second time you you made it over the third time but anybody want to understand that that the enemy is persistent at trying to pull away at what god has called you to and i tend to believe that as samson was getting more and more stroke here's what happens the enemy opens more and more doors that make you feel good so that you let down your guard to the future that god has in store for you so he feeds you things to make you comfortable i talked about that comfort y'all know that comfort that we're looking for at comfort where i just want everything to be the way that it should be and go the way that it should go i i just want to want to have things at peace and and the idea of peace is that i never have to do anything harder than what i used to do can i get the peace can i get the understanding can i get the clarity that god when i come to this side with jesus he's going to do everything for me and i'll no longer have to worry here's the thing you will still have to do and to work and to move and to trust but you do have to worry you don't have to worry about what god is asking you to do why because you can put your trust in him the bible says we we don't even lean to our own understanding in everything we acknowledge god so we trust him in all things and surrender our lives but it can get pretty hard when life gets hard anybody know life gets hard sometimes anybody know that things happen in the moment that you feel like it's way out of my control it's it's more than i can handle it's more than i can do it and you're looking for somebody say a way out god knows i need a way out sometimes i need a moment just to get me some clarity i need a moment just to settle my my spirit i need something just to get me a little bit relaxed anybody know that there's something about fridays and after the job when you when you work at the job and and people uh talk to you and say how you doing and everybody responds they say what it's friday [Music] it's it's it's friday what does that mean friday means this is going to be the most unproductive day possible here's what i'm going to tell you when they get good service hit between tuesday to thursday tuesday to thursday is a great time to get good service why because on monday folk act like they don't even want to talk to you on friday they act like they done done all the work and they are just showing up so the company don't fire them [Music] i'm not saying that's anybody here not in our church but what i am saying is is there's something about the relief of friday friday means sir ma'am there's a couple of hours before i clock out and when i clock out i am going to find peace that goes beyond anybody's understanding because of what i've just been through all week long fridays can we talk about friday friday is the place where i am calling for all the comfort that i can possibly do fridays is a place where i i i do some things i don't normally do during the week because they can hinder me from being productive on the next day and because i know saturday is available friday means that all gets itself loose friday saturday i'm tripping yet sunday i got to get it together ready got to get it together got to fix myself up because i got to go in on monday [Music] the idea is that friday gives us a level of comfort to let down we say our hair so that we can be comfortable not protecting and watching over our job that has to be secure and has to be looked at because there are responsibilities that are owed to us to fulfill when we're in monday through friday the problem is is that the enemy works like that in our life is that he treats every day like a friday and he's trying to get you comfortable enough that you think in your mind that your purpose takes a break and your destiny takes a break when you don't feel like going after life anymore i tend to think that there's a place in our mind where we think that the enemy will rest on stealing and killing and destroying but what you don't understand is that even in 20 years he never stopped going after samson and i'm here today to let you know there's something that the enemy wants out of your life that you don't value the way that he does if you understood that i am enough as we just sang with tears rolling down our eyes and hands lifted you would understand that my purpose never takes a break it never takes a pause because there's something valuable about what's inside of me that the enemy would be going after me the way that he is because he sees something in me that i don't even see in myself i want to let you know your addiction your brokenness your messed up-ness isn't because the enemy just wanted to put something in your life as a stumbling block he put it there because he knew the value of who you are the value of who you are he understood he looked and saw god's doing something special in this one the bible lets us know that and when moses was born it says his parents looked upon him and said there's something special about this child so much so that they risk their own lives to keep him safe i'm here today to let you know everything tried to destroy you everything tried to keep you in captive everything tried to take your life you were one clinic away from being aborted you were one individual away from being killed you were one place away from being abducted but the grace of god came in just enough time to capture you and take a hold of your life [Applause] i'm here because i want to let you know that god had called you before you were even in your mother's womb and he was calling you because he wanted you to understand that he had purpose and destiny set for your life the idea is that you were only built enough to do the very menial things of this world but here's what i came to the conclusion of why would a god come out of heaven if i didn't mean that much to what his plan meant to come all the way down to get in the form of the human to put his life on the line so that i could have salvation and know him great why would a god come out of heaven's hosts where he is glorified and worshiped and adored just for little old me there's got to be something on the inside of me there's got to be some purpose and some destiny enough for god to come out of heaven to say i'll die for you so you can fulfill what i've called for you to do [Music] i told my team on monday morning i said if this is all that i have to look forward to in my salvation in my baptism and in the empowering of the holy spirit is that all god wants me to do is just get by in life then i rather do without but i tend to think that god has something greater on the other side of this for me that's bigger than me just coming to church but he's called me to something greater [Applause] [Music] i tend to think that you don't know the power that lies inside of you you don't understand that god didn't just give you what's inside of you for the case of giving it just to you he gave it to you so that you could see greater and above and beyond what you could even imagine or think he didn't give samson the strength just for samson to have it he gave samson the strength because samson was supposed to be a judge for the people of god god is giving you what's inside of you because he's called you to something greater than what you could imagine or think but to tell you the truth we don't know the value of who we are [Music] so we settle for careers and relationships as the greatest value that we have in this earth to work for and we don't see anything greater than that so we don't plan expect or operate for anything more but there's something that the bible lets me know is that god says i have some things in store for you that no eye has seen and that no ear is heard and that no mind has conceived today i believe that god has greater for you and i don't want you to lose sight so not losing sight here is one of the first points that i want you to know and understand point number one is that your destiny will stay under attack the bible said for 20 years samson ruled i want to let you know is that samson was fighting the enemy before he ever ruled the devil is working so that you never occupy the space for you to even become a ruler the enemy is working right now so that you don't become the head of your home the enemy is working right now so that you don't put yourself in position to be what god has already spoken for you to be he is doing everything to thwart the plan that he has for your life the enemy is looking to see how he can destroy the moment so he's laying you down with word weary and burdens he's bringing things on you that charge your heart and and and disrupt your pattern of thinking he's he's interrupting your wisdom and he's interrupting your growth and your healing and and your path to where you're going and so he's laying things in place as a trap to pull you out of who you're becoming and every time you start getting closer can i tell you the enemy's always pulling you ever notice when you go do a great thing that the enemy's waiting on the other side like what you doing no no no we're going to mess this up real quick let me work with your attitude cause you always had a bad attitude so let me work right there and make sure that that i can spark you up like i normally spark you up or or you get really worried and you get really unfocused and you start having anxiety so let me bring some things in your life that bring the anxiety that stops you from growing uh so that you can what interrupt the process of becoming who god's called you to be and make the greater impact and you worry about the moment without worrying about the future i want to let somebody know who who's been shedding some tears why i always got to be going through why am i always going through in a moment why does it always seem like life is happening anybody ever feel that sometimes life just never stops it just keeps going and you get out of one thing and you're into the next thing and you get out of one thing and you're into the next thing and you get out of another thing and you're into the next thing here's what i want you to do in between things i want you just to praise god just like this it's a little bit just say all right cool here's why here's what i want you to do it for because what you're recognizing is that the enemy knows something that i don't know there's no need for an attack on an opponent that has no strength no destiny and no future i don't want anything that's not valuable and neither does the enemy so if i'm constantly under attack like samson what's your strength what's your strength what will bound you if you don't understand this that the attacks are a resemblance of the enemy going after your life then i want to let you know you don't understand the value fully of who you are you come out of attack i am so tired of the enemy attack you just got to remind yourself oh there must be something going on let me let me let me just praise god real quick because i know there's something else on the way that's trying to distract me so instead of me getting angry let me just let me get up let me get a praise real real quick hold on because i know an attack is on its way so i just need to boot up enough for the next attack i just need to praise god enough for the next attack cause why i'm on my way to my future i don't know what it looks like i don't know what is going to happen but i understand that god has something in saul when the folk get on your last nerves and you don't react when them people talk about you behind your back and you don't retaliate and you look at yourself surprised just stop right there and just give them a praise it's like i don't know who did that but that wasn't me i'm just going to praise him right there [Applause] here's what we're doing we're recognizing that god is doing something great on the inside of me that he's transforming me and making me brand new so i'm ready to praise god because i see a change is on his way [Applause] you got to praise god for that moment they cut you off you just be in that car like whoa i cuss nobody out thank you jesus i got to break them for every moment my kids acting like a fool let me just pray i ain't kill nobody we keep see here's the problem we keep stewing in it we keep stewing like oh my god cause if it had and i promise you in the last time they gonna do no all you just need to do is praise god in the in between you know what they let me go and that job was about to make me lose my mind let me just get a quick praise real quick because i'm thanking god that he's keeping me through the [Music] he's process me we have to learn to turn our complaints into a praise you know what it didn't go the way i wanted but when i go back and look at it i'm grateful i'm grateful the scripture says in first peter 5 8 through 9 it says be on your guard and stay awake just tap your neighbor real quick say stay awake my god lord's trying to get something to you over here sleeping ain't no place to get no nap this is a place to get your freedom to be on your god and stay awake your enemy the devil is like a roaring lying sneaking around to find someone i heard an old preacher say you just got to say to yourself not me just say it real quick not me not me he's looking for someone to attack but you must it's not an option it's not a possibility you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith here's what you've got to understand and this is what the enemy is really really good at is making you feel secluded as if you are the only one in the world that's going through problems here's the statements we say everybody is everybody around me is the people over there are here's what the bible lets us know it says that all over the world the lord's followers are suffering just as you are take rest that there are other people who are pushing through the struggle just like you are there are other people who are having hardships just like you are but they're making the decision i won't give up yeah i'm here today to let you know the enemy won't stop attacking you got to settle that in your spirit you gotta stop looking for a break you gotta you gotta see a break means you're not a threat man i ain't been attacked by the enemy in a long time i once saw look hey hey hey hey well uh enemy i ain't i ain't trying to be i ain't playing but why are you not attacking me do you not see something in my life valuable enough to go after do you not see something in my life valuable enough to try to extinguish and here's what the enemy is saying sometimes no because you do that for yourself worry don't worry monday's coming around the weekend's coming around you'll all the devotions you read you'll kill them at the end don't worry about it i don't worry about you ah you got to tell that enemy no no no not this time i've learned my value i've learned that these attacks are precursor to my blessings so i'm recognizing that i must be going through because i'm about to get through let's tell somebody that i must be going through because i'm about to get through don't you quit right now don't you start crying right now you let that tear go but you say guess what i know this attack is leading me to something your destiny will stay under attack i believe that the enemy is oftentimes going so much after you because he understands the value in you anybody ever watch national geographic you ever been there before when i go on vacation for some reason i love the animal channel i don't know why makes no sense i'm a city guy no lions and bears around me i don't have deer i don't have anything so when i go on vacation i tend to fall into this space of watching animals i love crocodile shows i like i love watching the people grab the croc and fight with it i love the accents come on hold them down hold them down holdy pull them in i love all of it i love it it's my favorite y'all they get them i said get them i mean when i tell you it's the best i love it you better get that they get them and they're running after it and i get to watch national geographic and they get into my favorite which is the lion oh my gosh lion's just roaming and searching and looking and i watch because the enemy never gives up any kind of prey a lion can take down a little elk a lion can take down a gazelle a lion can take down a baby it does it doesn't matter because it just wants to eat but here's where things really get tough alka baby giraffe small animals the enemy will eat off of but the enemy really makes its greatest impact when it gets a larger animal because a larger animal feeds the whole pack see when it gets the whole big hippo they don't have to eat for days if the animal pack can bring down the hippo one of the most powerful animals in the kingdom and they could get it feeds the whole pack for days here's what i want to let you know is that the enemy is seeking whom he may devour over many people but there are some big fish that he's going after and i tend to think that your destiny is so big that he knows a takedown of you is a takedown of a whole community you don't understand how connected you are and how influential you are and if the enemy says if i can just get you down then i get you your daughter your son i get your mother your mother-in-law your father and what he says is if i can attack you i can bring down a whole community instead of having to work piece by piece some of you you're the lifeline to god for your family some of you you're the lifeline to god for your parents and everything that the enemy has been doing has to get been to keep you off focus so that you don't have the spiritual strength to be able to impact anybody else let alone even yourself so he's working against you so you don't make the impact in your family men as the head women as the impact he's saying to myself if i can get you i can destroy the whole family [Music] if i can get you everybody coming down nobody gonna believe jesus some of y'all know y'all the only one at thanksgiving that's gonna be
