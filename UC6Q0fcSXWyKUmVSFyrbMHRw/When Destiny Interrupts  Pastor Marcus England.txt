43 welcome you those of you that are online and all over the world so excited to have you to be a part of this moment so grateful to have you with us we're going to talk about a little bit about destiny today mark 14 verse 43 and it says this and immediately while he was still speaking meaning jesus judas came one of the twelve and with him a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders it says now the betrayer had given them a sign this is what he said the one i will kiss is the man sees him and lead him away under god and when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and he kissed him and they laid hands on him and seized him but one of those who stood by and drew his sword we're not going to say no names and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear and jesus said to them have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to capture me he says day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not seize me but he said this but let the scriptures be fulfilled there's something in your life that i believe today that's going to be uncomfortable but you're going to have to let it be fulfilled in order for god to produce what he wants to produce in your life and the last part of this verse 50 says and they all left him and fled i want to come from the topic this morning when destiny interrupts when destiny interrupts let's pray father in the name of jesus we thank you for this moment that you've given us we thank you for the power of your presence for it changes lives we love you we honor you and we thank you for who you are in jesus name we say somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians and i celebrate our dream team who was our volunteers here can you help me celebrate those that are making all of this happen each and every week for us thank you thank you so so much we're so grateful when destiny interrupts i'm here because i believe that god has placed destiny on the inside of each and every one of us there is a purpose that god has placed there is a plan that god has for your life very specifically and you'll oftentimes hear me talk about this because if you don't understand there's a plan that god has for your life uh as a christian once you have received the baptism of salvation and the baptism of water and the baptism of the holy spirit you will believe that uh the journey of what god is calling you to do is over and you will believe that it stills itself at the position that you hold at your job at the degree that you hold in life at the position of uh where you are as a retiree or as someone that is still working you will you will literally bring your life into composure to this one space of this is all of who i am and i'm here today to let you know there is a lot inside of you god has created you with destiny already and you are finding along the way as you get to know him the destiny the purpose and the plan that he has for your life now here is what i want you to know is that you are not creating destiny as you go you are discovering destiny as god has intended for your life now i want you to be able to know this and repeat this say with me i have a destiny now it's important for you to know this because the destiny as we read in jeremiah 1 and 5 on last week the destiny came before you came god had already declared god had already spoken before you were in your mother's womb that you would have a destiny and a plan and a purpose let me share something with you about my god my god is so great at what he does that my god already is a god that is alpha and omega which means he is the beginning and the end but god is so much god that he can start from the end and go to the beginning god is so great in his understanding and his wisdom of who he is that god had already declared and situated everything you needed from the foundation of the beginning of this world before there was even a conception about you about what your destiny would be and then he started with the creation process so there could be an earth in which you have the ability to fulfill that destiny and i'm here today to let you know that because oftentimes we believe that as we go through life we are picking out the pieces like in a a board game or in a video game we're getting things along the way so that we create our own destiny i want to let you know today you're not creating your own destiny what you're doing is operating in the place to find the destiny that god has already declared over your life now here is what we oftentimes get a little bit discouraged when we don't see the destiny fulfilled is that we believe that we're doing something uh wrong and that we don't know where we're going well here's the thing you don't know where you're going if you don't know god if i get this part there for a quick second the reason why it's hard for you to know and understand and clarify the destiny that god has for your life is because if you are apart from god then you don't understand what god is speaking over your life if god is the creator of your destiny then you need to know god in order to know your destiny your destiny is not created by your position the destiny is not created by your job your destiny is not created by the college that you go to or the sport that you play your destiny is not created by the degree that you have or the political party that you are associated with today i want to let your destiny know that it was created already before there was a president or political party your destiny was created before there was a degree or specific area that you have i want to let you know that you were already set in place by god today the question is is will you make yourself available to god for him to let you know what it is he has called for you to do and i'm interested to know that because oftentimes we look at purpose as a destination in order to get to but truly purpose is the place in which you stay right now purpose is not a destination purpose is not a future job purpose is not a position that you get to purpose it's not a name that they will call you purpose is fulfilling what god says you are right now and who you will be in your future and if you could grab a hold of that i think you would stop putting so much confidence in what you do and you will stop putting confidence in who you are who does god say that you are who does god declare that you are i think that it's important that you understand that every time that you move along and every time that you move forward and every time that you see yourself operating that god is trying to fulfill purpose and destiny in your life yes yes yes i want to help you out real quick to understand it's not the job that you're doing it's not the position that you hold it's all that god has declared over your life your destiny is in god's hand now if you really believe that here is something that will be defined in your life is that you would be defined not by what is controlling you but you would be defined by who is controlling you and who is controlling you is that god is in control over all of your life now i i would like to tell you don't follow my footsteps but i i i kind of had this uh pattern of caring very loosely about jobs and what they paid me and here's the reason why uh pastor do you not like something to be able to pay you well no that's not the interest of it but here's what i know whatever god sets my hands upon i'll have the ability to acquire all that he has set for me so it's never determined by the position that i have it's always determined by what god has already spoken over my life it doesn't matter where i am it doesn't matter where i'm located it doesn't matter where i'm stationed it doesn't matter what the position is when god has already spoken success over my life it happens regardless of the venue the person the position or where i'm going because i understand that destiny is already declared you would be a little bit more advantageous in your relationship with god if you understood how much was at stake you wouldn't be so so obsessed with impressing your boss but you would be obsessed with pressing and pressing your god you will be obsessed with knowing that everything that i'm doing is consistent it doesn't matter if i'm working for the president it doesn't matter if i'm working for the mayor it doesn't matter if i'm working for a a person down the street everything that i do the bible says do it as unto the lord for he is the one you're working for anybody ever seen somebody love bragging about where they work you ever seen somebody they just you know you know i work at the pentagon you the pentagon huh well what you do secret they get deep on you you know how this i can't tell you everything but what i can tell you is it's important well well well well i i mean how close are you you it's important you know like and and they'll tell you it's important because they'll start to try to share things with you that seemingly the rest of the world knows nothing about anybody know covet there were there were there were people that were in government who i love i have great people but they would they would share little stuff on the side because they knew stuff that they would share stuff on the side that would be like really really important like i can't tell you everything but what i can tell you is that this is real thank you thank you i i needed your high level position to let me know that this was real even there got a time i don't know if you remember when colvin hit that there was a text going around and it had the statement in it that i have a friend that works in the government and that friend that works in the government is telling me that this is about to happen and you were getting oh my god not my friend that works in the government not the person that knows more than what i know here is where we have lapsed in our judgment is that we think that man's position over dominates god's destiny and i want to speak this to you today because when you are confident in who god says you are when you are confident in what god is speaking over your life it doesn't matter what position everyone else holds the destiny that god has set for my life will be fulfilled it is already spoken that it is yes and amen the idea that you know more than me is fine but the fact of the matter is i know more than you about what god has said for me but that's not true all about where we always are and what we're always doing why because we like to confer anybody ever been there where you you've got some issues in life and you need a friend around anybody ever need a friend you need some people to go to some some folk to talk to to get some wise advice i'm telling you you need people around you you need friends you need mentors you you need you need individuals in your life that help you get to the next step of where you're going but here's what i want to let you know at the end of the day your destiny is on you your destiny is not about all the people that's around you your destinies not about who agreed and who didn't agree your destiny's not about who said yes and who said no your destiny is about what you've made the decision to do your destiny is not about your spouse your destiny is not about your children your destiny is not about what everyone else is speaking because here's the thing everyone else that you're so concerned about has their own destiny to fulfill and if you don't take the time to understand that your responsibility is to do what god has called for you to do you'll get lost here is what jesus understood early in his age he understood that his whole life was purpose his whole life was filled with understanding what was the will of the father his whole life was about being obedient to what god has called him to do now here's the thing purpose is your whole life but there are certain seasons of your purpose where it seems more intense than others when jesus was young the bible lets us know he was around 12 years old he was in the temple he was doing what his father's work the bible says so he was always in purpose purpose was never just only the cross purpose was his entire life you need to write that down purpose is my entire life purpose is about all that i have going on purpose is about what i'm doing today to encourage myself about what to do for tomorrow purpose ends when i end i want to let you know today if you have breath in your body purpose is not over i don't care what you're retired from i don't care what social security is sending you i don't care what you got on the side in the 401k i want to let you know that as long as you are breathing purpose is still inside of you and you're called to do something the problem is is that we've always associated purpose with position and because we associate purpose with position when we retire we retire from life and not from a job can i tell somebody today is that just because you stopped doing something that you're used to doing for years doesn't mean god has ended your purpose i want to declare that to you because it's important that you go back to god because oftentimes we will pull away from something we will retire from something we will go to something else and we forget to go back to god and say so for the rest of this time what would you have for me to do because if there's no purpose then what's the plan and if there's no plan then what am i doing and the bible lets us know that jesus understood for all of his years of being on earth which we assumed to be about 33 he had purpose from beginning to end the bible lets us know that jesus he's hanging with his friends if you read in preceding verses they've come out of supper jesus has walked with them and he's taken three of his disciples into the garden of gethsemane jesus knows that the time is coming the bible is explaining that he's he's been talking about it and he gets into this moment with with his friends and and these disciples and he's teaching them and they're like rabbi we we love you and he goes into the garden to pray because there's something about knowing when you're entering into a different season of your destiny that their harder seasons there are than there are before and the bible says jesus is praying praying so hard that it looks like drops of blood sweat is coming out of him can you imagine praying so hard that you start bleeding all i know is if i start bleeding while i'm praying jesus better answer because this is some hard prayer i better hear something lord or i'ma make up something the bible says that he is there because he is torn between his assignment and how he feels can i tell you oftentimes you'll be torn between your assignment and what you feel you'll be torn between your assignment and what you want to do you'll be torn between your assignment and how you want to live in the moment and cannot tell you there's a sacrifice that has to be given it in order for you to become and go where god has called for you to become and go the bible says he's in his garden and he's crying out lord if you could take this cup from me let it let it happen not my will but your will be done can i tell you this may be one of the hardest seasons of your life as you're moving into the next season but god is calling for you and it feels lonely and jesus knew what it felt like jesus said as he came as he came out the bible he let them know that there were some there were some disciples there y'all anybody anybody ever know when you when you start getting older anybody start getting sleepy can you be can you be honest about it like you anybody know that you got that nod moment you know what i'm talking about that moment where wait wait you nod off for like a second and you just come back you'll be like oh jesus you don't know if eternity has passed you don't know if jesus has come you you just don't know what happened but anybody ever been there and the older you start getting can i tell you the things that start happening is is around it's around nine o'clock y'all know that hour nine you start looking start scratching start checking your watch if you're young i promise you it's going to happen you start looking at your phone what time is it again after you just looked at it you asked questions like that what time is it you ever seen somebody do that before what time you got the same time you got it like and bible lets us know that something was going on with the disciples they had a long day they're tired jesus asked them to pray the bible says they couldn't get a prayer in they kept nodding off can i can i tell you that you've got to stop believing your destiny in the hands of others because everybody doesn't have enough to be able to stay up and pray for you in the moments when you need the greatest prayer that's why a relationship with god is so important is because in the most desperate times of when you need him everyone isn't always available pastor i need you to pray for me i'm sorry but i didn't see my phone because i shut it off and put it on silent and i don't know that you're having an issue so you've got to have a relationship with god to be able to carry you through this moment rather than spending your energy getting frustrated on me because i didn't pick up or text you back you've got to have something greater with god that gives you the ability to know that if god is for me and god is with me then nothing can stand against me you gotta have something on the inside of you to know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you gotta have something on the inside that let you know i'm more than a conqueror i got to have something on the inside that says i can't fall at this moment even when no one else is around my destiny is still at risk the bible lets them know that in this moment destiny interrupts the conversation and judas one of the twelve in whom jesus actually called betrays him and betrays him with the kiss and the bible says we have a breakout that happens people talk about baltimore has crime look at the bible i don't know anybody's ear that's been cut off lately the bible says there's an ear in this moment that's cut off it doesn't give who and it doesn't talk about where they came from but we know somebody traveling with jesus is still working out their soul salvation a knife pops up jesus knows all things he let that knife slip in i'm just telling y'all you got to look at the text he lets the knife slip in and the knife comes out slices an ear off it's bloody jesus got people joking him up on one hand he's got blood in the other hand as he's trying to reattach an ear the first evidence of plastic surgery jesus does it the bible lets us know that somebody pulls it out now i'm this is a sidebar the idea is that mark wrote the gospel of mark but mark was not there knowingly as a disciple of jesus so it lets us have an understanding that there's a possibility that mark's account is influenced by a certain disciple a certain ear cutting disciple it's amazing how this person leaves their name out of the situation when this happens i just wanted to give you all that insight real quick you can go back and study that but the context is is that when destiny really comes for you and it interrupts your life and you've really got to act in faith because faith without works is dead and you really have to come to grips with what you were speaking you won't always find that there's a crowd of people around you the bible says in that moment when when jesus jesus had this moment it says that the the disciples it said it didn't even say the disciples it said everybody they fled can i tell you that some of the biggest moments in your life are going to happen alone we're so used to celebrating with a crowd that we think when no one's around that it's not a great time to celebrate but the problem is is that most of the time when you're getting to where god's called for you to be it's a time for you to celebrate because you're by yourself here's the reason you're by yourself no one really thought you gonna get there nobody thought y'all were gonna make it 58 years it gets quiet when when when you when you've been married for a long time and everybody was talking about y'all in the beginning and it was talking it looked a little shaky then i i don't know about that when they don't got it all together and you see it happen and you look years later and you look around you and it seems like everyone else has fled can can i tell you there are some things that god has called you to that you feel lonely and loneliness doesn't equal to disappointment there are things that god is doing in your life that you're by yourself in that he's trying to work through you because if he has to work through the people through you he'll never get to you there's some isolation moments that god is calling you to because he needs to get your ear not the ear of your influencers and god is speaking that because he's trying to fulfill destiny that's on the inside of you the problem is is that we're trying to do destiny with the group and god hasn't called you to destiny's child this is not this is not a group performance in your life god didn't call you to a trio just tell your neighbor say your destiny is yours your destiny is yours it's not the groups it's not anybody remember going to school and you had everybody remember group projects y'all remember group projects and it usually happens somewhere around science class get together get the group present the idea and make it happen first of all you had complications well who was going to get the poster board that was the biggest problem that you had who's getting the poster board well i'm not really near a store oh you're not near a store and you would get into a group and here was the greatest part you were getting to the group of people you like anybody know about that the problem is is that oftentimes the people you like in the group weren't the best people to get in a group with they were amazing when we were hanging out but when it came to work oh my gosh you'd be like i did not know that this was in your head and at the end of the day regardless of what the grade of the group was going to affect you do i got any folk in here who just you don't even like working with people anyway so you told the group i'll do it myself i got some of you in here i know i do i know how y'all do y'all don't got the poster boy you didn't got the glitter you're the bedazzled dick talking about h2o you got a whole stream flowing out the back of it you got all of this going on because you said at the end of the day because this is going to impact me i'll just do it myself the problem is is that we haven't turned that same methodology into our lives and we're looking for the group to agree for me to take the next step and what god's called me to do and the problem is is that when times get heavy the group tends to leave yeah if you ever sat in a college class in a large room i'll never forget being in engineering and we were in the like the largest hall that they had possible had to be about 200 of us and we sat before the professor and the professor said i want you to look because you think this only happens on tv no this is real life see i wanted you to look to the person on your left and look to the person on your right they're probably gonna be here and you would just immediately be like wow you're not gonna be here but the problem is they were looking at you [Music] and that's what the enemy is saying look to your right and to your left you're not going to be here and you have people who are speaking that to one another because they don't understand that we're supposed to be in it together instead of us doing it by ourselves i want to let you know today that your destiny lies on you and you have to take responsibility for what god is speaking over your life you have been called to fulfill the purpose that god has for you but here's what i want to let you know your purpose is not wrapped up in your job your purpose is wrapped up in what god says you are to do how do i know that because i've been created for god and whatever he wants me to do is what i'm called to do colossians 1 16 says this christ himself is the creator who made everything in heaven and earth the things we can see and the things we can't the spirit world with its kings and kingdoms its rulers and authorities all were made by christ for his own use and glory you were created for god's use and what glory you got to write that down why is that important because you will stop looking at what you do and start looking at who created you and you'll stop focusing on what i do as being the focal point and you'll start saying who created me what do you have me to do somebody say now because purpose is about fulfilling the now not about fulfilling the 10 years the purpose is the entirety of your life not the peace of your life you're not climaxing to a moment you are all about feeling the moment god has for you now now it's important that you understand that that christ is the creator because if you don't then you don't understand that he's spoken those things into existence before they even were john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god that same god is in the beginning of genesis genesis 1 and 3 says and god said let there be light i want to let you know that today god has spoken into existence the question is will you fulfill the destiny that he's spoken or are you fulfilling someone else's the question today is what are you trying to get that's not for you where are you trying to be that's not for you what are you trying to get to that's not for you but if you took the time to find out what was yours you will be fulfilled no matter where you are here's the thing money and the lack of is not the product that you are in your purpose right because the defining part that you'll think is that i'm doing well and better than the rest of the world because i've acquired and acquiring isn't god's destiny it's a part of god's blessings acquiring is not god's destiny it's a part of god's blessings so what you think you've acquired does not equal out the idea that you have fulfilled your purpose that's why getting a different job that's why getting another house a better car is not the fulfillment of your purpose so you can stop weighing it on your salary you can stop weighing it on if you're in a relationship you can stop weighing it on if you have a degree you can stop weighing it on all the things that you have acquired my question today is do you feel fulfilled in your purpose where you are and if you don't feel fulfilled where you are then you're not fulfilling your somebody say your purpose this is this is this is for us to know why because i i need you to gather this because what you'll go into the new year praying is god help me fulfill your purpose instead of praying for more things because some of us are praying for things here's the reason why we have inactive prayer lives because i don't have anything to pray for anybody ever know you sat down to pray be honest with me you sat down that's how it was i'll get lord i love you lord forgive me lord if you can just pay that bill amen because the totality of my life was wrapped up in the acquiring of what god could do instead of asking god so i need you to tell me what we gonna do today i need you to tell me where i'm going today so i know how to wrap my mind around what i need to do i need you to show me how this purpose in this space that i'm in right now i can fulfill here's ooh here's the reason why that oftentimes we don't get ahead where we're supposed to be because we're not recognizing that the moment that we're in is our actual destiny and if the actual moment that i'm in is my destiny then the level of urgency that i'm in in this moment will always be at such a high scale because i would recognize that my destiny is in jeopardy so the reason why faith is needed is because i need faith in order to fulfill the things that god has for my life because if i don't step out in faith then i have nothing to believe for oh so oh jesus uh y'all i'm sorry i'll be having moments it's so it's so important because you would stop shifting your life around pleasant opportunities because you think every pleasant moment is an identifier of destiny and that's not how it works relationship with god brings identification of who you are which gives you the understanding and revelation to where you're supposed to be if i understand where i'm supposed to be then i can follow god's path according to what he's called me to be able to do and i don't get stuck in my mindset that where i am is the last location because my my uh uh my destiny is not based on my location my destiny is based on what god is saying you what do we what do we talk about in this world what i want to be all the time right that's everything what are you going to be what are you going to be what if you didn't know the occupation you just allow god to use your life with what he's giving you would it what if you were like abraham and just one day god's like listen leave your land your homeland and go to a land i have for you it's crazy right now right because my job and my degree say who i am so there's no other space for me to operate because i've already set at 20 years old who i was going to be for the next 80 years i'm messing with y'all ain't i y'all like this ain't funny pastor and i'm like what if there's a possibility that god has placed something inside of you that your degree and job hasn't defined oh i'm messing with something because now you're thinking well what did i get it for and and you forgot to read ecclesiastes which says there's a time in season for all things but you place a permanency on what god meant to be only a season [Applause] i tried to tell you because you would seek god every you would seek god three times a day because you got so messed up with what just happened that you would think what you just did was wrong oh my god what did god just say no i know he didn't just say that did he just say that you would be like oh i gotta go pray why because i need to know what god is saying here's why you're not gonna pray in the morning because you have no thought process of adjusting what's happening with your life because you've already settled this is what it's gonna be so why pray to a god when i've already settled who and what and where i'm going to go and be i have no need to go to a god who is going to give me a different direction that's a possibility that steps out of the format that i already created for who i am and what i established for myself when i was in high school why would i consult god about something i already determined y'all like i'm going to another church [Music] man trying to mess up my life i'm just interested and what if there was something else inside of you that you didn't know see half of the time i'm gonna talk to y'all online half of the time we're bored with ourselves because we're not interested in what we chose for ourselves so the only motivation we have is what we can acquire and the money we can get because it's the only thing to keep us interested in who we are because we don't have purpose so purpose is not defining it it's what we do that's defining it so in order to enjoy my life of what i do i've got to make it more creative because it's not doing anything new and it's not going anywhere so the only influence can be more of what i have and the more is the only thing that can give me direction to what i need to do and where i need to go that's why i pray for a raise so much because there's nothing else interesting and what i'm supposed to do so life is at a standstill because the job is at a standstill now you allow what you do to control where you go you give me keith can i just like talk to y'all like this because you have created barriers on the wrong side you created barriers for how far god can move instead of creating barriers for how far the enemy could come in so god's like well i i don't got no room to go nowhere and you're like and satan's always on my neck that's because you've given him so much leverage to come in come in as far as you want coming on my marriage as far as you want coming as far as my children as you want because you're not taking a stand for anything because you don't have an understanding of the purpose that god has set you up for and since you don't know the man or the woman of god that you're supposed to be your standards outwardly are so minimal because you just want to be liked not parented you just want to be liked and not be a leader you just want to be light so you've created bandwidth for the enemy to come as far as he wants and god has no room to work in your destiny so the limits you placed on yourself are a result of the lack of how you see yourself and the lack of how you see yourself is a lack of relationship with god not love but relationship because you're like i love jesus and i'm like you sure do the problem is is you're not spending any time with him so all you can do is love him you just can't hear him so that's why church is enough i just need my sunday because there's no expectation from monday through saturday if i had no clue of what god wanted to do today i would go before him right and ask him what do you have for me to do he would tell you what he has for you to do and you'll be like that's impossible he's like exactly i'm the god of what and possibilities i can do exceeding and abundantly more than you could ask or think then you would be like oh that's how the bible works is that i'm supposed to be flowing in things that i don't have resources connections and abilities to accomplish on my own so it must mean that i need god to do it and if god does it then that means i've got to keep him in the loop because i don't know the next step without him but because i have a predetermined direction that's been conjured by me i don't have to worry about asking god for anything because all i'm doing is living the plan out that i had when i was 16 and i wanted to be a firefighter and that was all i had in my mind and god said i called for you to be more but the problem is is you never came back to ask me so you let your job and how you feel be the determining factor instead of my will for your life and when you finally ask god his will your destiny interrupts your comfortability now y'all sitting here like what in the world am i doing because i gotta figure out am i in me or am i in him point one can i tell you this your your purpose is personal we the bible says it's not good for man to be alone so many of us seek individuals to be with a spouse a friend individual nothing wrong with it part of god's will that's what you would like for your life problem is is that when the two become one it doesn't mean the destiny and purpose become one god has a plan for your life god has a plan for your friend your spouse or the individual's life that you have in your life the idea that you think we're supposed to do it all together without there being anything else to be included in it is crazy because now you think that someone's responsibility is only to you and not to god that's why you have controlling people because you control when you don't have your own purpose so you need someone else in the space to control them and fix them because you don't know what to do with your time that's why so many people get in relationships fixing other people because they're not willing to what resists the temptation to be able to say you know what instead of fixing you how about i go and fix me so they put a placeholder in a place where god should be instead of allowing god to tell you who you are and then when you get with someone they ask you what god said that's how it's supposed to look so when you start dating was god called over your life well this is what god called over my life and what god called over your life this is what god called over my life well let's see if we can bring those things together and operate but the problem is is that i'm not letting go of minds for yours and you shouldn't be letting go of yours for mine because be because now you're obsessed with what i'm doing and upset when god's using me and now you feel like he's not using you because whether i have a mate or i don't have a mate i still have an identity and most of us believe that it starts when i get someone can i just share something with single people real quick listen i'm gonna sing this last no i'm gonna tell you i got in trouble last time talking about talking talking it was i'm not to say who but there was a couple people that got me in the lobby and it got rough my security wasn't there or nothing like that and they got up in my face and they said listen let me tell you something you was on the men's side and i'm not playing you need to make that thing open and equal i said i got it sisters but i'ma be like peter and not give any more information the idea is that you're walking into something with an identity and a destiny that you're working on and that someone is coming in conjunction with not finding when they get to you anybody who ever knows why the bible says a man that fighting for wife because she already knows she's a wife you ever you ever think about a man that fine is a wife he's finding a wife because she already knows what she is no no no no again i got jumped last week and i'm scared no y'all wasn't there last time don't talk about you got me i was accosted i was accosted in this church [Music] and i'm telling how this is so important because the idea that you don't know where and who you are means that you're not ready to try to identify someone else's purpose and we're pulling triggers so early not because you need to know everything about what your future is but you need to know who you are and who you are comes from god and without relationship with god you are wandering bible lets us know in proverbs 19 21 it says a person may have many ideas concerning god's plans for his or her life but the only but only the designs of god's purpose will succeed in the end anything else that you try to do outside of god's plan and purpose will not succeed only the things of god will succeed what success being in the will of the father not how much you have and i'm not against how much you have i'm all about you knowing who you are some of us need a moment to get to know yourself so when people use trickery you don't start self doubting who you are you can start proclaiming no no no you're not gonna talk to me like that make me feel like i'm crazy because i got my mind right and i ain't crazy i know where i am i know who i am and you would establish boundaries in your life that would be for the benefit of your destiny point number two is that your process is pronounced so what you're going to go through stop telling people we doing this private thing nothing you're doing is private we got this private relationship no you don't it's public and it's impacting people either negatively or positively that's not even kingdom mindset we gonna do our thing how are you gonna do your thing when your thing is god's thing how are you going to do your thing your thing is your feelings it's not really your thing it's your feelings and i'm interested are you willing to obey your feelings for your purpose some of us are so committed to people that were under committed to god we're so like my heart i would never i would never betray i betray you in a moment if god says something different i'll betray you in a moment you know you know we we family i don't care where we are god said something different here's anybody got a problem with change come on be honest anybody anybody don't like change tell the truth the lord is looking at you i didn't point to you but i did point to you but i didn't mean you because i don't know what i am saying is is is that many of us are opposed to change because change means that we're going to be uncomfortable but that's what destiny comes to do it comes to interrupt the comfortable to bring uncomfortable so that there can be actually something that's changed in your life that doesn't keep you at the same place some of us are so after comfort that we don't know how much it's damaging us and destiny's trying to interrupt you so would you i only go out on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays god's like i need you to do something on monday nope i told you lord tuesdays thursdays and saturdays can i tell you that god has called for you to have some friendships and some people in your life that are totally different than you y'all like who oh no no no god's like no no no i've actually called them to be in your life you're like absolutely not no way because i know i called them in your life no there's no way there's there's absolutely no way we're supposed to be having lunch and god's like but i called it into your destiny i'm interrupting you're comfortable for uncomfortable you're like there's no way here's why because the 20 year old you who knew nothing said this is how your life is supposed to look like this is the way we gonna do it this is the way how it looks this is who i'm gonna date is how tall he gonna be this how just how tall she gonna be they gotta have uh mocha caramel hair they gotta you know like it's all this stuff i made up a starbucks hair that's what i mocha mocha karma what in the world is that that sounds like a latte man but you set up such a destiny for yourself already that you don't have a space for god's and i'm here today to let you know that god's calling you to something different that your life probably would be way more interesting if you follow him instead of following you because the only return you're getting on it is houses and cars and the problem with houses and cars is they depreciating value way the market is you can have a great house and next year have a horrible one that you overpaid for and what i'm trying to do is tell you to put value in the things that matter pastor you love your life i love my life because i know i chose some things and i weren't i wasn't comfortable with and i'm okay with that because there's still fulfillment even when things aren't perfect see that's the difference in walking and purpose is that purpose even in uncomfortable still is fulfilling that's a little challenging ain't it your process is pronounced psalms 22 7-8 says all who seek me mock me this is david he said they hurl insults shaking their heads he trusts in the lord they say let the lord rescue him let him deliver him since he delights in him somebody said we're just going to leave you to yourself we're going to leave you to your jesus your jesus ways you're holier than thou art you'd be like well leave it to me then because i'm willing to risk it all on god then risk it on you can i tell you in process you need to be so concerned about your destiny that you don't mind offending some of you god has called for you to be a leader right and you're like i'm just going to wait and buy my time when you really need to be trying to do everything to do to get into position where god's called for you to get to i'ma say this some of us are way too lacks with our destiny when god called me to pastor i was in people's faces who hadn't they have nothing to do with me they didn't want anything to do with me they weren't trying to do anything guess what i was telling them i don't care because god's called me to be in this moment and if i don't get this moment then the next moment won't be as effective as what i need it to be and some of us are waiting for people to give us permission to be able to learn from the season we're in so that we can use it for the next season instead of you caring more about your destiny to say i'll barge in and if i can just hear under the door i'll be a part of it stop waiting for an invitation just go up to somebody and say can i anybody hey you hey y'all got any positions open you like when they give me a raise is when i deserve it you better walk up in favor hey are y'all giving out raises just was asking i didn't see a bulletin on it but i was just interested you start walking in jobs you know you're unqualified are y'all hiring you're like do you you have your doc doctor's degree no i was wondering you don't need any extra doctors no all right good school i just i just wanted to know i don't know if you you know i was hey listen you haven't you have a degree in medicine no no no not at all no i'm electrician wait what start walking in if you could believe more in yourself you would stop being fearful of opportunities that have a possible no and you would start demanding your destiny that god has for you they said i was a leader you need a prophecy you need a land of the hands you need a burning bush you need god to descend us in and descend again all for you to make a decision that might possibly be the one and god's like if you don't take some handle in your destiny and purpose there's a meeting available and you're like well i would love to be in it if i could and if they allow me to be you just need to walk up like can i be in that meeting because i need to hear what's going on because i'm the next leader that you're supposed to have so i just wanted to know could i be in that meeting and listen to what you're saying do people like but that's not your position i just want to know i'll make time in my schedule stop looking for your destiny to be handed to you and start placing yourself in position to possess what god has called you to i've never seen so many people waiting for it to be given and god is saying i've opened the door the rest is your responsibility some of you have called to ministry god's like go for it you're like well you know the pastor he didn't say anything you just walk in there and then you start vacuuming wait who are you i'm ronald did you go through growth track no well what are you doing god called me to this you but we didn't ask you to do it oh no you don't have to i know my destiny i know what i'm supposed to be doing now so i wasn't waiting for you to give me the okay i'm just waiting on you to tell me i can't some of you just need to be waiting for the no too many of you are waiting for the yes you just need to apply for it you just need to walk in it you just need to establish it and let somebody tell you no i'ma be honest with you single people you got an eye on somebody and you're scared because pastor what the bible says is a man that finds the problem is is you've been hidden so much and you don't talk and can't nobody find you you like a gazelle in the back of the woods i ain't got no social media i ain't got nothing i ain't got no facebook pictures i ain't got no fingerprints i ain't got no social security well how is somebody supposed to find you but god said a man that finds a wife well can you come into the open so they at least could see you [Music] my god got to help some folk they down in the back woods underwater talking about i'm looking for who god has for me you got to come up so somebody can see you [Music] there are some things that god has for your life that he's just waiting for you to possess and you keep waiting for him to give and he's like i've already given permission go after it today i'm believing that your destiny is trying to interrupt your comfortability and i believe like this moment you just got to have a yes even when it's uncomfortable you got to have a yes some things you walked away from i said this in the the first experience some things you walked away from and you weren't supposed to you walked away because it got hard so you thought god was going to assign you a new destiny that was easy that's the stuff we do i'm y'all i got to get out of here oh my goodness some of y'all have ran because you're like god obviously you you know what i am i don't like it and i don't like it so and god's like yeah i'm giving you a whole new word a new destiny so that you can be comfortable as possible because i don't want you stressed out i was stressed out in the garden i would not do that to you and you forgot to read this if they come against you they're going to come against me if it was heavy for me it's going to be heavy for you take up your cross and follow me i'm speaking this today because some of you think god doesn't work and i'm here today to let you know he works fine prayer works fasting works faith works all of this works it's just got to be applied properly and you've got to understand your destiny is not on god your destiny is on you god has already completed it before he even started it so today i need you to flow in that place man i'm going into this new year expecting god to do more than i could even imagine or think according to the power that's at work within us can you just tell somebody beside you real quick and courage and tell them you can do this tell somebody else on the other side tell them you can do this tell us their choice i'm sorry i'm a third choice but you can do this you can do it let's pray father in the name of jesus we declare and speak it today that you would do more than we could imagine or think in this moment god as we are moving forward into this new year we are not expecting you to do for us we're expecting that god we would walk in what you have already spoken god help our minds help our hearts let us be transformed in all that we do so that we can become all that you've called for us to become for we love honor and thank you in jesus name if
