foreign we are in week three of our series unfinished business and I think we have some unfinished business to continue to go into we're going to be in Nehemiah chapter 2 today Nehemiah chapter two and if you don't have your Bible the scripture will be available on the screen but I want to let you know I think God wants to speak to you today I believe he wants to speak in your life I think he wants to speak into an area of your life that you may not have thought about and I want to be able to just unveil and speak what God has spoken and so we're in Nehemiah chapter 2 Nehemiah chapter 2 starting at verse 1 going to verse 9 and it says this in the month of niacin in the 20th year of King are the Xerxes when wine was brought for him I took the wine and gave it to the king I had not been sad in his presence before so the king asked me why does your face look so sad when you are not ill this can be nothing but sadness of heart I was I was very much afraid but I said to the king made the King live forever why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in Ruins and its Gates have been destroyed by fire the king said to me what is it you want then I pray to the god of Heaven and I answered the king if it pleases the king if your servant has found favor in his sight let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it then the king with the queen sitting beside him asked me how long will your journey take and when will you get back it pleased the king to send me so I set a time I also said to him if it pleases the king may I have letters to the governors of trans you Freight so that they will provide me safe conduct until I arrive in Judah and may I have a letter to Assaf Keeper of the Royal Park so he will give me tender to make beings for the gates of the Citadel by the temple for the city wall and for the residents I will occupy and because the gracious hand of my God was on me the king granted my request so I went to the governors of trans Euphrates and gave them the king's letter the king had also sinned army officers and Calvary with me I want to come from the topic this morning break the ceiling break the ceiling just tell your neighbor real quick break the ceiling tell the neighbor on the other side say break the ceiling look at your third choice and say I'm sorry you're my third choice but break the ceiling can we pray today Father in the name of Jesus give us the strength the ability to break the ceiling I prayed today that by your power and your might that we would be able to receive everything that you have for us help us today not to occupy the space that we're in but help us to occupy it with open ears so that we may be hearers but not only hearers doers of your word in Jesus name somebody say amen amen can you help me celebrate our band worship team and the people of God in this place thank you so much there is something to remembering when you started working I don't I don't know about you I don't know if you're into that place where you can remember your first job but I remember my first job and I remember working with youth works it was a job that was given to me um it was not of my choice can I start there it was not a job of choice it was a job that was given to me to learn responsibility now I'm not here to blame anyone I'm not here to blame a specific parent but I would think to learn responsibility a parent would want you to learn responsibility in the safety of the places where they can keep an eye on you no no I was sent into Baltimore City youth works with people I do not know to go to McCullough and North Avenue somebody say Amen right there my God to go into McCullough and North Avenue to sweep the streets of Baltimore when you understand the verbiage of cleaning the streets I am the literal manifestation of that word I clean the streets I went down Druid Hill I went down McCullough I went down North Avenue and I swept to make sure that the city was all together I got this job and my my mother wanted to make sure that I was learning responsibility and and I got that quite early but then there was a time when I was transitioning from high school into college I I was going into Morgan State for computer engineering and and and I find myself at a place where I had to transition that summer into a summer job and I'll never forget I I went to the kind of high school it's a great High School you might have heard of it um it's Dunbar High School the one you're and uh and so uh uh it was the kind of high school that put me in a place where I learned how to type I learned how to build a resume and I even learned how to code I don't know if y'all understand that but it was some serious ability now what they did was they taught me how to build a resume and in that resume what I what I learned is that you you would put the information of where you are and where you live you would give an objective anybody got caught up in that part right there there was an objective I didn't even understand why we had an objective the objective was to get a job but I couldn't put it that simple there's way too much going on the objective was to get a job but you had to put this nice objective and and here's the thing when when I was applying for it you couldn't go to Google as fast and do a copy and paste real quick you know how we doing these days y'all have somebody else's resume format the way that it looks are you done you didn't type the whole thing up it looks amazing you don't even know how to even work within it because you don't even have skill in Microsoft Word you just like I don't know how to shift this but we gonna leave it right where it said and and I'll never forget pulling together my resume and I had to hand it to Hopkins because I was working in their computer repair where we would go throughout the hospital and compare and repair the computers and I never forget any anybody remember I'll never forget that that that resume when you first start and resumes about one paper long y'all you know about that resume right you made the font bigger so that it feels like it could it could fill up the page anybody ever been there before and you get and your spacing's a little different anybody ever been there before you're at about 1.2 1.3 if it don't look filled out enough you're willing to go to 1.5 just to make yourself look like God is doing something in your life I'll never forget filling out this resume and at the end of the resume it it had all my information where I worked and I talked about the many many years that I was in the streets of Baltimore cleaning up the many many many years that I was in there because I started at 14 so I had I had a stack y'all I had a stack of you but there was nothing like getting to the sheet and I had one sheet of paper and when I handed that sheet of paper and it doesn't look like I've done much it looks like I've got little experience I I don't really have everything I need to be able to get there and and I'm just hoping somebody hires me because they feel sorry for me but when life kept going my one sheet of paper turned into multiple sheets of paper and the ability and the experience and and and and and and for some of you the many many many degrees that you have that you don't even use right now are stacked up on a resume it begins to show you what you've done with your life anybody got the resume of their life going on you ever looked at your life like my God what do I have what is in my life and when you look at things some of us got long resumes because you got fired a lot of times so Yoshi is is missing you know you're ever seeing where it goes present to a year and then you skip about two years and everybody's in the in between wondering what happened in year two and you're like let's not talk about that season that wasn't the season that things were going well there's a resume that gives a picture of your life when when I'm looking at Nehemiah nehemiah's resume looks pretty good the Bible lets us know that Nehemiah was one who was passionate about his assignment to build the walls of Jerusalem and to re-fortify the gates because the gates had been burned and the walls had been broken down and we find Nehemiah who is born into captivity the Bible says he's a Babylonian child who is of Jewish heritage get this to you and be able to pull this out because many of us believe that the end of where we will find ourselves in life has everything to do with where we started but I want to let you know today Nehemiah is showing us that because you may have started in a broken place doesn't mean that's where you're going to end it doesn't mean because there's been some hard times and some issues in some areas and roadblocks in your life that you're going to stay where you are but I want to let you know today Maya was living a pretty good life actually in Exile the Bible says he's a he's a cup Bearer he's doing well he's right next to the king and and when we read scripture says the King has never seen Nehemiah sad can you imagine that that people have looked at your life and cannot recall your sadness can you imagine going through all that you've been going through but you never actually show it on the outside can you imagine the burdens of life that you've gone through and the issues and and the moments that you found yourself feeling like you can't hold it like you can't handle it no more and anybody ever been there before just to say something real quick to say to yourself man I was ready to give up but you never look like your circumstances I thank God that I don't look like what I've been through I I thank God that where I am today I can still smile can anybody still smile here in Baltimore can even in the midst of Waco is anybody still have a smile on your faces real quick turn to your neighbor and just smile at them real quick here's what I want you to tell your neighbor I don't look like what I've been through my God I could smile to you right now I can give you a a big laugh and and I can shatter but here's the thing if you understood my story if you knew the background of where I came out of if you understood what God has done in my life I don't look like where I come from [Applause] see the idea is that I can smile even in the middle of what I've been going through because I've learned that my circumstances don't control the outcome of what God has already spoken and declared over my life so now today is the moment and opportunity where I have to realize I I don't necessarily look like what I've been through because if you look like what you went through you'd be crying right now right now you can identify that God is a keeper [Applause] whether it turned out the perfect way you want one your breath in your body and you sitting here right now says that God is a keeper even in the midst of the storm that you've gone through God is able to do more than you could ever imagine or think he can do exceeding and abundantly above all that you can ask or even think God does not put me into the place where I look like what I've been through and I'm here today to let you know I have been through some stuff can I get an amen in this place you may can't see the scars right now because God is such a Healer I want to let you know I'm not just talking about physical healing I'm talking about some mental and emotional and psychological healing I don't look like what I bet you don't know the way that you should talk to me you don't know the way that they used to speak about me you don't know the stuff I've been through but I don't look like what I've been through just tell your other neighbor real quick I don't look like what I've been through my God if you knew what I've been through if I could sit here and share with you some of the things that life has brought me if I could tell you how I was still thriving even when I was in captivity if I could tell you how I'm still making it even though things are tight if I could tell you how I'm still moving even though things don't seem to be in my favor that God is still making a way out of no way you would lose your mind you would cry right now for me but I recognize if it had not been the law that was on my side I don't know where I would be I would probably lose it right here I'm sitting calm but you don't understand I'm ready to lose all my mind right now why because I don't look like what I've been through thank you guys because I understand I don't look like what I've been through I begin to recognize that everything that I've been through I'm noticing that it has always been to keep me from the purpose and the plan that God has over my life it wasn't just for naught or nothing if you've never read a good King James Version but the devil was scheming after your life because he saw once you have been birthed and created that God handed you a purpose that could begin to destroy his kingdom generationally break barriers begin to Open the Eyes of the blind not just physically but mentally and emotes he found out if you got a hold of recognizing who you were created to be it could mess up all of his plans it could put him in the place where he would be losing battle after battle that's why he has been orchestrating since you got here and God gave you a purpose that you would not fulfill what God has called you to be he has established to make sure that depression has been the very existence of how you live your life out that the anxiety of living through life and figuring out what's next has been composed over your life he has made sure that fear has crippled you so that you go no further than where you are and what he has said is if I can build a resume that makes them feel good enough about who they are I'll never have to allow them to see the real picture of who God's called for them to be I want to let you know today that what you have written on paper is not all of who you are I know you got a couple degrees I know that you're making some good money I know that you got six figures out there I know the savings is looking good I know when you type it up all you see is degree and degree and degree and then you begin to see job and experience but I'm here today to let you know you are not the sum total of what you see on paper for the opposite side people that may look like me when you look at your resume it looks too short you feel disqualified when you look at it it's missing space after missing space why because I didn't fulfill and do what I needed to do there's some dreams that I left out there's some pieces that I don't like talking about there's some things that I don't want to remember and I leave outside of it and if I could forget it all I would and so my paper has been defining how far I can go and I'm here today to let you know don't don't you allow your paper to be a ceiling [Applause] the Bible says that Nehemiah was that such a place passionately understanding the calling that God has said over his life that he went in the presence of the king and the Bible says he says to the king I want to go do something about the problems I see what if what if all of the things that you're noticing in your life all of the things that you're looking at that you complain about what if God called you to be the solution you know we love complaining as long as we're not responsible to change anything look at them look at that um look at it all that stuff look at that yeah look at it that's why it's going downhill that's why it looks the way it does we we love to observe complain and then go back to our lives we love to look at the totality of what's going look at Baltimore mm-hmm another one and see that's the problem with the sea that's why I'm moving because there's nothing here for me what if God called you to be the solution to the problems that you see around you that would break some of the yoke let me use a better word that would break some of the bondage that is in our lives what if God used you to be the answer just just look at your neighbor real quick and say you might be the answer hmm hmm hmm wait ho ho who me yes you you don't know my resume you you don't know what what I what I've done you you don't know I'm not qualified to do that you you don't recognize how how lost I am you don't you don't understand that I didn't have both parents you don't understand how abandoned I feel you don't understand my past you don't understand I came out of foster care you don't understand I was adopted and then you don't understand the people didn't love me and and I'm just crazy enough to still say to you you might be the answer [Applause] what if you were the answer what if you were everything that God was looking for where he called you to solve bring solution and bring peace to the very state of where you are but all you do is have the ability and all you've been empowered by the enemy to do is complain because you don't believe you have the qualifications to speak life and to speak change into the area that God's called you into I want to let you know today is that what you have on paper is not the totality of who you are I want to let you know whether you graduated or didn't graduate God can still use you I want to let you know today whether you got three credits left or 30 credits left God can still juice you I want to let you know today whether you're working in a Fortune 500 or Burger King God can still use you it doesn't matter where you are God doesn't need your qualifications to make his purpose happen I want to tell somebody today if you are crazy enough to believe that God could still use me right where I am today it doesn't matter how qualified I am God would say I'm here to let you know I'll release you [Applause] the Bible says the king released Nehemiah because he saw what was happening inside of Nehemiah are you desperate enough yet are you desperate enough yet to go to God and ask him release me in my purpose is he enough to go after God and stop living a very mundane life that has you on a repeated cycle of living out the same way you've been living all your life your mama lived that way your Grandmama lived that way your aunt lived that way your auntie lived that way your uncle lived that way your sister lived that way your brother lived that way are you willing to break the cycle of what God's called you to do and say God I'm just crazy enough to ask you release me into my purpose [Applause] have you gotten tired enough of running on the Wheel of what you think is going to fulfill you have you gotten get all the promotions that you have will never get you to the point of fulfillment because God has set a plan and a purpose distinctly over your life and you cannot avoid it are you crazy enough to believe and think that God would use you even if you've got a two-line resume to say Lord I want to be used by You release me to fulfill my purpose Release Me the Bible says that herxes gave him a letter he gave him a paper anybody wish you could make up your own resume sometimes no seriously y'all like what if somebody gave you the pen it was like go for it what would you write on there what would you add what would you put on your resume that's not on there now World Traveler you you wouldn't have to over emphasize this is stuff I used to do I would you would be an administrator right and you would call it this level position you'd be like oh I'm an executive associate administrator of business acquisitions what do you do I order Staples wait what that was a long title to buy some Staples and paper clips the thing is we don't believe in who God says we are so we bump up and put fluff on who we wish we could be When God says I've already created you greater than what you want to be what I've called you to supersedes your ability to be an executive administrator over Acquisitions in business it gives you the ability to go further than your degree could ever take you it gives you the ability to go further than any other job experience could take you God says I have something for your life that no eye has seen and no ears heard and no mind has conceived the things that God has in store for those that love him but you are trying to make up positions that God already has and God's trying to make up a position for you they say hey what you want to do God God you know I just want to be out here impact their lives all of a sudden you're applying for jobs that you're not even qualified for can I tell you right now you're not even qualified for what God has over your life but he's still going to use you if you would be crazy enough to tell God lord I'll fulfill the purpose and call it that you have over my life just release me give me a letter I need God to write my resume ah Marcus England PhD Who's laughing don't play with me that's my vision lives on the Hills in Baltimore Maryland address unavailable private entrance right all right highest in his class [Applause] leadership abilities above what we've ever experienced references anybody [Applause] call anybody about me [Applause] I'm just that good you can walk up to a stranger Marcus you want to know about Marcus is incredible you know Marcus everybody knows Marcus what if God called you in this world to have such impact that everybody's supposed to know your name what if God has been crazy enough to think past what you thought was going to be everything you needed to get everywhere you wanted to be to put you in position so that you could see life in a different kind of way to fully give him the glory and honor over your life every time you would walk into a space people would ask you how'd you get here you would say I was born here what do you mean it's where on what supposed to be ask your neighbor real quick are you where you're supposed to be some of you didn't even look at the other person you just the question for yourself answered it for hold on I think I think this is broken up give me give me that you see what the it's nothing like when I get a handheld because then I start trying to have church y'all y'all know what I mean so you don't want me to get a handheld in my hand but what I believe today thank you is that God is calling you to a place that you haven't seen before that's why it's scary you like what you've already seen James with God's call you and say today I need you to come up and preach you there what's your message title God loves us all that's what I need you need to be on it you ain't had no message sideways look at y'all y'all he ain't got nothing James said God love us all I got two minutes past so let's go I don't know where I'm coming from I don't know what scripture I'm using but I know God loves us all what if we were so ready for everything God has for us that point number one we would do this we would stop measuring our future by our past some of you the only way that you see yourself and the only way that you see what God is doing is by what God did can I tell you some of you the greatest stumbling block in your life is what you did not what you're going to do because you're looking to what you did as a pinnacle and you're like well I can't reach no higher nowhere else to go but what oh you're saying listen I I I don't know what else to do because you're thinking your life is dependent on what you've done for yourself and God is saying I have greater in store for you stop measuring your future by the past the scripture says this in Philippians chapter 3 verse 12-14 I like the message version it says I'm not saying that I have this all together that I've made it but I am well on my way reaching out for Christ who has so wondrously reached out for me friends don't get me wrong by no means do I count myself an expert in all of this but I've got my eye on the goal where God is beckoning us onward to Jesus I'm off and I'm running and I'm not turning back can anybody declare that over their life today I'm not no no I'm not turning back I'm not doing I won't go back to where I was I'm not turning back don't you whistle at me somebody at the mall yesterday and I heard somebody say hey hey they tried to whistle I said did that just whistle at me I ignored it if it was one of you I'm sorry but I was not responding to no whistle I'm not turning backwards to go back and rehash out all the frustrations that I already went back over you why are you going back over you had a season that you were already going back over to go back over it again the Bible said he who the son sets free is what so you got to get some Freedom so you stop talking about your past like it's your present you know back when we we don't want to hear back when you know back during covet listen we all want to forget that covet even happened don't take me back to before you know before call you know how things were things were listen God is not interested in going back in your past is interested in changing your future stop measuring your future buy your pass the second thing is don't ignore your calling the Bible says the kind of Anguish and sadness that Nehemiah had he knew he was called to something else can I tell you some of you are called to something else and you have been denying it since the beginning pass on I don't even know what I'm called to you know what are you running from I ain't running from nothing yeah you are and whatever it is you're running from God's been calling you to and you've been like you know what no I don't I don't want to have to deal with that I don't here's the thing your calling is going to require you to face you and most of us don't like facing ourselves well I don't like no I don't want to talk about me it's like a resume you highlight all the what good stuff nobody on the resume says got fired hit my supervisor in the mouth shouldn't have been touching uh talking jump no that's the year you do what you leave it out don't you what happened that year oh just some things went along and I just couldn't see eye to eye [Music] you got arrested spend it and that's why you back out talking about let's just just forget that time the Bible says it's letting us know that there's a calling that God has over your life and the calling that is called you too is something you can't deny or push off you have to understand God's calling over your life Isaiah 6 and 8 says this then I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom Shall I sin and who will go for us then I said here am I send me y'all looking at me like nope that's not what I said Isaiah said that I didn't say that the question I have for you is God is saying who can I sin I'm interested in how many of us are raising our hand and saying send me I got sad eyes Happening Here people looking at me I didn't say that but you can't ignore the calling that God has over your life well Pastor I anybody ever said I don't want to fulfill that calling it's too much so do not be disturbed by the disorder that surrounds you because you were called to the chaos around you to bring it into subjection so why chaos stirs around you don't get it confused you are supposed to bring peace in the space when you ignore and reject your calling Arky happens around you because you have resisted the ability to bring it into order the question is what's happening around you that you are complaining about that you're supposed to bring order to I can't stand my family you know how they are every time we go over there that's why I only go over there for one time in the holiday because every time we go over there I got to deal with them bring some order walk in that house and begin to say I plead the blood of Jesus on all y'all they'd be like oh no we're not doing that today we're not doing I don't even know what the blood of Jesus is I'm a vegetarian too I don't I don't do no blood um you go in there and shake some places up you haven't learned to shake up the area and you've learned to adapt thank you [Applause] that's what we do we go in and adapt we're not talking nope okay I guess we all gonna be quiet then you you are talking we're not talking so I would like to say hello to everybody and start going down the road what's your name they'd be like won't you be quiet no because I'm a disrupter I come in and change environments I come in and change atmospheres I don't adapt I make moves that's who God created me to be me to be a chameleon to figure out and be like everything that's around me he came at me and told me be something different I love when everybody 's running after things that look like everybody else because it's easy to go where the crowd is but how many people do I have in here that says you know what I'm gonna go against the grain today I'm going to be the one that's not like everybody else I'm gonna be the one that's the individual that says my purpose is going to overrun everybody else it's gonna come out and everything I do so what you do today I was in prayer with God you always got to talk about God yes [Music] some of you have been so quiet and your salvation that nobody knows well Pastor they can see it in your life they want to hear out your mouth to hear everything else out your mouth [Applause] they hear everything what you're complaining about who you don't like what you don't do how much money you got what you drive all your Investments they got everything else out your mouth but the word of God you better go somewhere and just disrupt something how y'all doing Jesus wait what I didn't ask you that I'm sorry it's just inside of me now I understand the Saints of old when they would talk about everything about God what they were saying was you won't change my space Not Gonna Change how this is going to be you're gonna change it listen you better go to your child basketball game and be yelling out you better praise him I mean make that shot it's y'all gonna be like nope you're not coming next week no no cause you're not gonna keep hollering out like this when we stop avoiding Our Calling we stopped putting ourselves in position to be like the rest of the world the Bible lets us know in Ephesians to attend you are a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for good works they did not call you to be a copycat tell your neighbor real quick stop copying so we keep doing copying I want to be like no be like who God called you to be my last point is why we can't ignore the calling as we release and give over to God we're called to take the next step in Authority someone say Authority ah God take the next step in authority acts 1 and 8 says this but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and this power that God had given the disciples was very specific to the assignment God has given you power for the assignment what he's called you to is for the assignment is giving you power Right Where You Are so here's the thing it's like having power but not using it because you're fearful that you don't have the power the power you have is yours so you speak it in authority how do you not speak over your children when they're yours you have the authority and the power how do you not speak over your health when it's yours you have the authority and the power he says through the Holy Spirit ye shall have power the problem is is we have too many people who don't understand that they have the power that they don't recognize that God has given you everything to break loose The Curse Of Satan over your life the life of your children the life of your marriage the life of your home you are called to speak into it well I don't want to upset nobody the enemy doesn't start moving until you upset him you better start speaking over some stuff and understand we don't fight against flesh and blood but against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places why are you praying over me Mama cause I called to do so I've got the power to anoint you my mother would anoint me and say in the name of Jesus you will be everything God's called for you to be you better get some Authority up in your life rather than beating somebody how about your anoint them and speak over them [Music] the Bible says I'll beat my body into subjection speak to yourself stop allowing yourself to do everything it wants to do and start declaring through the power in the name of Jesus that I have authority today every Next Step you walk in it bad so how am I going to do this walk in that gym and save the day I got Authority if it's authority to do one minute if it's authority to lift one weight if it's an authority to do one sit up I've got what Authority and guess what I'll have authority tomorrow to do too and I'll have the dirty the next day to do three and every day I'll claim one a greater authority over what God has spoken they may not be where I want them to be but as I continue to declare over their life they shall come unto subjection and you shall have power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you Pastor why am I struggling because you're lacking power why am I lacking power because you're lacking the Holy Spirit [Music] you shall have power when the Holy Spirit how can you talk about things like this because I've seen it done I've seen people heal I've seen depression heal I've seen anxiety heal no you don't understand the clinical no you don't understand the spiritual I know where my authority lies you're Authority is off of what paper my authority is off of what the Everlasting God so when I say thy will be done on Earth as it's already been declared in heaven speak that thing with the Surety and Authority that I can speak over what your degree says I can speak over what the doctor says and declare today in the name of Jesus there shall be healing in this place [Music] don't you take the next step trying you take the next step in authority this will change I'm looking for this will change this will not stay the same this will change in the name of Jesus Christ I believe this today that we're called to break the ceiling that we place over our lives and God is calling us for something new I speak this in this place today you have everything you need to be all that God has called for you to be
