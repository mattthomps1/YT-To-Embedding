[Music] [Music] good morning guys and welcome to mix kids at the beginning of every year our church participates in 21 days of prayer which starts today during these 21 days let's learn the lord's prayer which can be found in the book of matthew chapter 6 verses 9 through 13. for the next three weeks we are going to talk a little bit about prayer today we will learn that prayer is communicating or talking to god why should we pray because it makes our relationship with god stronger can you imagine trying to have a best friend without communicating with them prayer is seeking god in his direction for our lives praying also helps to keep us out of trouble jesus told us to pray matthew 26 and 41 says watch and pray so you will not fall into temptation i am gonna hold up some items and i want you to tell me what they are are you ready all right the first item is a letter in an envelope the next item is a telephone a radio and of course a newspaper what do you think these things have in common if you said they are used to communicate you are right before we talk more about prayer let's watch a video think about your best friend don't you want to tell them about that cool thing you saw don't you want to tell them what your favorite flavor of bubble gum is don't you want to tell them that when you dropped your sunglasses in your soup it made you frustrated don't you want to tell them that you just learned how to play a song on the ukulele but it hurt your fingers and so now it hurts a little bit to pick up your toast with your left hand so you have to pick it up with your right hand but that means it's harder to draw a picture of a friendly cactus while eating toast you and your best friend have a relationship and when you're in a relationship with someone you want to tell them things and you want to listen to the things they tell you it's the same way with god you can have a relationship with god too you matter so much to god and he wants to hear about all the things and he has lots of things he wants to tell you and that's why we pray so we can have a relationship with god [Music] prayer is simple we talk with god to get his direction for our lives god is so good and will help us when we are happy sad sick or even when we're in trouble god will even give us wisdom his strength and understanding if we only ask him in fact god is willing to give us many good things as long as we ask for them in accordance to his will god answers our prayers with signs the holy spirit and his word the bible when we pray our relationship with god grows our memory verse for this week says pray continuously first thessalonians 5 and 17. awesome job before we go let's sing and dance to pray about everything by life tree kids [Music] don't worry about anything and said pray about everything tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done don't worry [Music] don't worry [Music] [Music] thank him for all he has done don't worry don't worry [Music] if you do this if you do this peace will guard your hearts and lies [Music] he's [Music] welcome back did you get pictures or videos of your worship to god we would like to see please have your parents send those pictures and videos to our instagram page at the mix underscore church becoming a part of god's family is a great decision to make so if you need help understanding how to become a god a part of god's family have your parents send us the email at mixed kids at themixchurch.com now let's take this time to pray together dear god thank you for loving me so much thank you for choosing me and thank you for helping me to see how important it is to pray god i pray that you will help me build my relationship with you through prayer please help me to remember to pray every day in jesus name men
