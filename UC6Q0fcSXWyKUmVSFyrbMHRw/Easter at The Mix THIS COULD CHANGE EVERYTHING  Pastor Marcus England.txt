[Music] John chapter 20 verse 1 and it says this now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still dark and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb the Bible says so she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple the one whom Jesus loved and said to them they had taken the Lord out of the tune and we do not know where they've laid them so Peter went out with the other disciples and they were going toward the tune [Music] both of them were running together but the other disciple outran Peter let me let you know who this other disciple is the other disciple is John the one who is actually writing in this scripture and it says both of them are running together but the other disciple outran Peter this is John talking about how he beat Peter and reached the tomb first and stooping to look in he saw the linen cloths lying there but he did not go in then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb not lying with the linen clothes but it it understands it says winning in the Tomb and he saw the lending clothes lying there and the face cloth which had been on Jesus head not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself said then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed he saw and believed for as they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the Dead then the disciples went back to their hopes I want to come from the topic today this could change everything this could change everything can we pray father in the name of Jesus we honor today that you Rose from the grave and you did not only rise but you Rose with all power in your hand so it means today that there is still hope I pray that you would guide our hearts and God our minds open our hearts to receive from you today open our ears to Here let us not just be hearers of your word but allow for us to be doers of your word in Jesus name somebody say amen amen God bless you musicians thank you listen can y'all help me celebrate all of our Dream Team our volunteers come on y'all help me celebrate them big time in this place [Applause] I feel like what I just read to you was a good series a a a a good story that that you may want to check out later on it's it's in what we would call the New Testament but if if we were talking through a Netflix sort of thought process this would be season two Season Two Season one was the Old Testament it was the understanding of the law and the levitical law that Christ had set forward where God has set forward for Christ to come and and in season one we had a whole lot going on we had deaths we had superheroes like Samson we had individuals y'all we had drama we had King David killing off somebody's husband we had a baby out of wedlock yo we we had all kinds of things happening in season one anybody like a good series not in a good series gets you caught up it gets you all connected and here's where we leave at the end of God's word we leave and there's a 400 year silence anybody ever been there before when you're watching a good series and you're waiting to know what's next but the series hasn't started and anybody ever been there before where you're watching the series so much that you keep typing in Google when the season two start listen right here I noticed I was looking at it I was like man this is a good book if you want some real drama you don't need to go to Enoch Pratt you can open up the Bible it's got some real rom-com drama sadness it's got all kinds of up and down moments and as we're we're reading it we we start the finish of this ending of season one and we're waiting for new character somebody say a new character now they haven't given the name of the new character because they're trying to keep you in suspense because the ideas is if they tell you about the new character you'll you'll you'll know about it and you'll start googling it and so the so it keeps it away from you that in season one they keep calling him the Messiah but he's got a new name in the New Testament and his name is Jesus and Jesus comes on the scene and there's nothing like the New Testament starting off a new season with a new character and you're like oh my goodness who is this on the scene it's been the one they've been talking about they've been hinting about and Jesus comes on the scene and y'all the drama starts from the beginning if you can be honest everybody like a little drama like a little something going on there and what happens is the Bible lets us know that Jesus is coming through a virgin boom in that a way to start Jesus comes to a virgin Joseph is about to leave Mary he don't want no parts with it an angel of the Lord comes in and interrupts him he's got to keep the baby and raise it as his own while Mary talks about she was incepted by the Holy Spirit y'all this is crazy this ain't nothing but episode one and this thing getting crazy and so good and all of a sudden we notice that Jesus gets an inheritance the Bible says three wise men come with frankincense and Marion though and and and and they they come and they offer Jesus finances you know Jesus got a little he got a little Bank he got a little bag little kid he got a little baggy and and then then he's got a run to Egypt because somebody's trying to kill him because he is the king of the world y'all didn't know all this was happening did y'all see if you reach about tell your neighbor real quick you got to read your Bible oh my God if you would read your Bible you would get glue to the stuff that's happening in God's word Jesus grows up he goes into the temple oh my goodness his parents leave him they leave them by himself he gets left they come back we don't know if he gets a beating or not Jesus finds himself and then it ends anybody know when it ends you don't even know what happens oh my goodness it ends and it picks back up and Jesus is 30 years old either the writers got bored or they didn't have any substance to put in there and so it comes Jesus is 30 the Bible says he gets 12 new friends that's a lot of friends he's like an influencer anybody know influences he's an influencer he gets 12 guys to follow him and give up their life doing the whole thing Jesus does some crazy things y'all one episode is called Wedding and wine Jesus turns water in to wine I don't know why you wouldn't pick it up now I will be downloading the Bible right now Lord what is this this is crazy Jesus heals the sick he raises the Dead oh he's the hero in this story we get to the part where Jesus is at the Pinnacle of his ministry but the story takes a turn and the Bible says that he offers himself up as a lamb for the Bible says Jesus dies yeah he dies but guess what it's a spoiler alert how many people want to know all right I'll tell y'all don't get mad at me if you didn't read it because I want to share and it's a spoiler alert he rises from the dead boom he rises from the Dead this is where we end up and we end up with a testimony we end up with the testimony that actually reads to this moment because it's like four different people are given us a story about what Jesus did and they all agree somebody say agree that Jesus died and he rose again but the story that we're reading is John's story and John is talking about himself and John remembers the incident and anybody I remember like an and over right before you ever heard somebody talking and they're sharing the story and there's a voice over and it's letting you know what's happening that's what John is doing John said Mary Magdalene told me she went to the Grave she saw Jesus died and she went back to the Grave three days later to finish his burial but the problem is is that when she got there Jesus wasn't there this is the testimony of real people who remember the real incident of Jesus Christ this was not written when Jesus was dying this is somebody say a testimony John gives us a testimony and and and he starts to talk about and Mary came and then she told us Jesus is no longer at the grave me and Peter jump up and he says and me and Peter jump up I ran and when I ran I beat Peter anybody know about embellishing anybody ever been anybody ever told a story before that you embellished and anybody ever been there before when you tell the story it changes every time anybody ever been there before because the idea is to make you look good in the story I'll never forget this is when I was real real young real real young and my bones were working properly and I'll never forget it was Thanksgiving we were playing tag football I never forget I was an artsy guy but my father was a sports head and he put me in the football game and he said let's play it was a group of guys from the church and we were over at the park I'll never forget it had my cousins with me and everything and they set me up and said you're going to run the ball I said I don't know how to run the ball they said run that way as fast as you can I'll never forget we were in the huddle I kept trying to get out nervous they passed me the ball and I remember running now I had a friend his name was Dwayne Dwayne was taller than me and he could run I mean really run matter of fact he runs now but somebody say but but God black God put something in my feet like fiery coals and when I got that ball I ran so fast that Dwayne ran and tried to catch me y'all but you the skill level of the way I dusted him and I went around for that touchdown y'all I was like can't nobody stop me you see how the story changed at the end you see how the confidence came back I want to let you know I ran that fast because I was petrified I ran that fast because I did not know what in the world was going to happen to me if he caught me I knew it was touch football but something on the inside of me said you better get your tail out of here when you have a play like that you know what I did afterwards I retired to know when to hang it up right I retired all right well I'm good y'all remember that all right yep good you want to play next Thanksgiving no I don't want to play at all I'm good I'm going to stay right where I am the Bible says is John is writing a testimony and he's writing a testimony of what Jesus has done here's why a testimony is so important is because a testimony gives credit to what God has done when you have the testimony you have two or three that can come together and understand that what you are speaking is true but the thing about it is is that everybody doesn't have to believe you as long as you have somebody say a testimony there's something about the ability of a testimony that reminds you when anyone anyone tries to make you believe that you don't have what it takes there's something about a testimony what you find out in Matthew Mark Luke and John is that they have a testimony that God is no longer dead but he is somebody say risen if I understand that God has risen then I understand I don't serve a dead God I serve a living God and if I serve a living God who can defy death it means I serve a God that can do all things if he decides to do them now here's what I want to let you know when I recognize her that God has all power in his hand then when I begin to understand is that my testimony speaks to the value of what he can do I don't know if you understand but I recognize that God Is A Healer I recognize that God is able to keep me from falling I recognize that God is a Waymaker out of no way I recognize that God is a keeper when I can't keep myself let's actually never real quick do you have a testimony because if you have the testimony you've got something to declare that the Lord has done I don't know about you but the Lord has kept me in such a way that I am amazed that I am still here today but by the blood of Jesus Christ I don't know about you but he kept me all week long he watched over my mind anybody been acting foolish some of their adult life and they notice that God is still yet faithful even in the midst of my absence even in the midst of when I don't have it all together even in the midst of when I've been defying what God is saying anybody have a testimony if I could share with you what the Lord has done now if I can share when the Lord has brought me back to life if I could share when God has done more then I can imagine a thing I would tell you I've got a testimony let's tell your neighbor real quick I got a testimony I don't have all day to share what he's done but when I look back over my life and think about what the Lord has done I automatically begin to have a praise I begin to thank him because I know he's good in spite of me I know he's good when I don't deserve his goodness God is always somebody say he's a faithful God if I recognize that on Resurrection Sunday then I know the Lord is a keeper y'all y'all don't understand how my mouth used to be you don't understand the way my anger used to be you don't understand the things I used to do I've got a test timoni if we pull somebody up from your past you might not have a testimony but they would have a testimony because there's something that God wants to do with each and every one of us is that God wants to prove that he is your god can I can I share something with you God wants you to have an experience for yourself so you don't have to rely on a single person to remind you of his goodness if you understood why you were going through what you're going through you would understand there's a testimony at the end of it you would recognize at the end of it there is a story an opportunity for you to share of the goodness and the love of God I don't know why you may be going through what you're going through but I'm here today to let you know that God wants you to have somebody say a testimony hmm it's a testimony and as you come into this Easter there's a couple of things that I want you to leave understanding I want you to leave this Easter Point number one I want you disrupted from the normal how many of us are getting tired of the normal it looks the same it does the same some of you already know you don't even go on social media anymore because it all looks same anybody want to see something different I just think God is trying to disrupt the normal he's trying to help you understand that the life he's called you to is a life that looks nothing like everyone else's I'm interested are you willing to live out a life that looks much different than what you know but a life that exceeds your greater expectation I'm here today to let you know you aren't supposed to look like her you weren't supposed to look like him you weren't supposed to dress like them you were supposed to be who God called you to be the problem is is you're too interested in everything else to take time to figure out who God says you are if you found out who God really called you to be it could change the very life that you're living right now you would find yourself in a place you would say I was never supposed to live this way I was never supposed to think life through this way my marriage was never supposed to be this way my family wasn't supposed to be this way and you would get a little bit irritated with everything being the same way it was last week I dare somebody say I'm ready to disrupt the norm I'm ready to disrupt the things that I don't even know I dare somebody to be crazy enough to say I normally sit on the left side of the church but I'ma sit on the right side today something needs to be disrupted in your life because God is trying to get your attention you are so used to the mechanical movement of your life that you don't even have a need to ask God anymore for what you need and what his direction is because you have already sustained that yesterday will look like today and today will look like tomorrow and tomorrow will be the same thing over and over but I'm crazy enough to believe that there is somebody in this place on Easter that is saying I think this could change everything the scripture says in Luke somebody say Luke chapter 4 . I need you to get this in here it says this in Luke chapter 4 verse 18 through 19 it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me anybody the spirit of the Lord upon you don't be scared tell your neighbor don't be scared the question is is the spirit of the Lord upon you boy said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me he said to proclaim the good news to the poor he has sent me to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty those who are oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor I need to disrupt the norm to disrupt the normal that's in timham again next Sunday some of y'all's tripping y'all was like wait what I was I crazy enough to think we could do I'm just gonna throw it out there since I got you how about we try this again next week the church said wait what every week wait we gonna do this every week just throwing it out there we already started how about you join us and we love to do it with you let's tell your name I love to see you next week it's the people that did this uh uh anybody want to disrupt the normal in their life anybody get tired of the mundane I mean this is overly consistent because you can expect it already anybody know that your prayer life isn't really happening because you don't have anything to pray for anybody's like I don't have anything to pray for because everything's going away I thought it was going to already go so I might as well stay where I already am keep doing what I'm already doing my life is not bad the problem is your life is not complete God is calling for us to disrupt the normal God's calling for you to be able to see your life operate in a way you've never seen it before somebody God is calling for you to operate and move into a season of your life that you've never considered some of you God is calling you to people while you are running as an introvert away from them some of you God is calling for you to take the next step some of you God is calling for you to come back home some of you God is calling for you to forgive some of you God is calling for Restoration in your life today but I pray that he could disrupt you from the normal Point number two I pray you leave here compelled to trust God I I pray today that you would be so compelled to trust God that you would have faith beyond what you could imagine or even think the faith to believe that God can do the impossible I God didn't die for you to stay we are God died so that you could have a life that is beyond what you could ever imagine or think the Bible says there is something that no eye has seen and no ears heard and no mind has conceived the things that God has in store for those who love them I'm just interested do you have the ability to live out what God has in store for you or will you continue to live out according to the way you feel which has gotten you right back to where you are second Corinthians says this 5 14-15 for Christ's love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for them selves but for him who died for them and raised again tell your neighbor real quick it's not about you your neighbor like who told you that the scripture he just read the one that says it right there I would compel you to trust God at this season of your life I would compel you on this Easter to be able to trust God with the things you don't know I'm just believing this today there's something you don't have a plan for and whatever it is you don't have a plan for I dare you give it into the hands of God I deal with every you would have it I take take you must trust God because if you don't trust God you will end up where somebody before you already ended not trusting God means I've got to follow someone else's plan and if I follow someone else's plan it means that the plan has already been done which means if you're following someone else's plan God doesn't have a need for you to do anything new so all you're doing is repeating what already is I pray you're compelled to trust God and last but not least Point number three I pray that you will be excited for greater can we can we pause right there and just say okay can you get excited for something greater than where you are Pastor what does that mean that means being able to have the ability to see that God has more in store for you than just where you are today here here's what I believe I believe there is something in your life that God has greater for you that if you would reach out and allow him to move in your life like never before you would see the move of God in a way that you have never seen God move before I'm just expecting somebody say this word greater if I could expect greater from God it means it doesn't matter what is happening right now it means that God is already in the middle working it out and if he's working it out it means he's working it out for my good if he's working it out for my good then that means whatever he has is better than where I am right now and where I am today and so what I tend to believe is that if God has greater then there's something I should be preparing for and in expectation of that God wants to do in my life greater than what I can ever imagine or think so it must mean that God has me in position for something I haven't done before I wonder if you would position yourself in a place where God can do greater in your life more than you can imagine a thing here here's what I think greater is in store when we have an expectation that God is waiting on us see but greater makes sense when I understand that God has something more for me then I could ever imagine or think what if someone just attacked you and said God has something more for you [Music] you just gotta disrupt the normal you just gotta get out of the same place you bet you just gotta get out of the same mindset listen listen listen listen listen listen listen oh listen I want to tell you there you can work the same job and you can move in the same vein and do the same things over and over I'm gonna tell you what it's going to produce for you it's going to get you more money it'll get you a bigger house it'll get you a better car it'll get you more money it'll get you a bigger house and it'll get you a better car but it will leave you empty it will leave you defeated it will leave you without Joy it will leave you without substance but I am here for somebody that is ready to disrupt the normal that is compelled to trust God that says even in the midst of it it doesn't matter how much better my house gets it doesn't matter how much better my car gets if I don't have God I don't have anything I I need the favor of the Lord over my life I need God's Savor inside of me I need something to move beyond what I can drive forget what I'm driving forget where I'm living I need God to do something more I need the joy of my salvation I need something greater in Mia that it is in the world I need God to do more [Music] I need more I need more I need more I need God to move in my life I need more I need to be able to sit in my bed and not do anything and feel fulfilled in purpose and knowing that God is working on the inside of me even when it feels like nothing some of you are uninterested with life because nothing's going on right now but some of us are waiting on the Lord and we're being of good character because the Bible says he's what strengthening my heart and then we're understanding if I am not weary in my will doing in due season I shall reap a harvest it don't look like you're doing much I'm waiting because the Bible says if I wait on them Harvest somebody's saying due season anyways you're busy but I'm just waiting on due season schedule's full but I'm just waiting on due season if I can wait on him I could trust him John 10 and 10 says this I came that they may have an enjoy life and have it in a abundance to the full till it overflows listen I want you to tell your neighbor real quick just say I just just wait just wait if you if you could just wait on God if you can trust him in the waiting season if you could know that God is doing something that you cannot do of yourself that you don't have the ability to put together and smooth over and through your own lens and through your own craftiness and through your own decree and through your own smartness if you could understand the Bible says if you wait on the Lord that induce you shall you shall reap the Harvest if you would think not [Music] what are you doing I'm just waiting what are you doing I'm waiting what are you doing I'm waiting I don't know when he's coming I don't know where he is but what are you doing I'm waiting you're gonna work yourself to death trying to get what God has for you but somebody around you say just take a minute away because in due season shall reap a harvest if you what ah can you just tell somebody else on the other side don't faint you look a little weary you look you look a little weary you look a little anxious but all you all you got to do is just wait and while I wait I'll Just Praise Him voila while while I wait I'll just glorify he's been good [Music] I don't have everything I want right now but he's been good the doctors may have given me a bad report but he's been good anybody just kind of Praise on the inside I'll praise you in this sickness I'll praise you in the storm I'll praise you when everything looks like a sin I'll praise you even though I don't financially understand they that wait on the Lord he shall renew their strength they sell mouth upon wings like an eagle they shall walk and not get weary they listen I I just tell you to thank him all the way through father I thank you today I don't have enough strength to do anything else but to thank you today here's what I believe I believe that as you wait on the Lord changing everything Right Where You Are and I believe today in this house that white God the Bible says when he died you know what happened on day two [Music] the Bible said he went to hell to take the sting from death in the victory from the grave I wonder what God is doing while I'm waiting I wonder what God's repairing while I'm waiting I wonder what God's fixing together and who God's moving over there so that I get elevated and what God is Shifting to the side so that I can walk I wonder what God is doing why you wait [Music] [Applause] here's what I believe I believe he's changing everything [Music] is what I tell you is that in these next 12 months I believe that God is trying to do something in your life [Music] foreign that you need to be a part of something that can shift you forward and not take you back here's what I did I dare you to give me 12 months coming Sunday after Sunday I dare you to just give me 12 months somebody say 12 months why so long Pastor some of y'all a little jacked up um so uh but I believe that there's a shift happening right now and I believe that God is saying for those that want to shift I'm ready to shift I'm ready to move and to execute in a way like never before So today we're trusting and believing that God is able to do what he said he can too let's thank God because we understand this could change everything [Music] [Applause]
