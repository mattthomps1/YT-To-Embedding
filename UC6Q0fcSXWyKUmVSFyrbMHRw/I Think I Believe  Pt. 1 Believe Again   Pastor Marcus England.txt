way down till you see just tell your neighbor real quick the Lord is in this place the Lord is in this place [Applause] can I tell you you don't want to be anywhere where the Lord isn't you don't want to be outside of his presence you don't want to be outside of the police and he is dwelling we need to be glad that the Lord of hosts is with us the Bible says the god of Jacob he is the god of the ancestors of Israel he is the god who established through what looked like it could not be he is that God that said I am and therefore because I am you are also today I just want to let you know today that you're in the right place at the right time and I think that God has something to say in this house today can you just look at somebody real quick and say I think God's got a word today come on turn to somebody else and say I think God's got a word today look at your third choice and say I'm sorry I'm a third choice now but God's got a word today and I am ready to hear an expectation what God is saying today I'm excited because we're beginning a new series and we have a new series this September called I think I believe I think I believe and I want to get into this rather deeply and connect with you in this moment because I believe that this series is one of those that can change your life if you connect and so what I want you to do is get out your notepads hear that we say that World Changers are what note takers right and that we want you to get out your Bible because we really believe that readers are what readers are leaders so if you can open to the gospel the book we call it the Gospels it is that which has been written in testimony The Book of Mark chapter 16. now I'm going to read a couple of verses 5 to be exact six and I want to open this moment for you to believe again this is an opportunity where God wants to open your heart again for the things that he's spoken and promised already over your life that sometimes the cares of this world can distract us from where things like covid and things like uh different viruses and diseases and and the worries of this life can get you off of focus that God has already declared something over your life and that he has already spoken it to be but he's just waiting on you I want to tell you today that I'm not going to preach a message that you're waiting on God I'm going to preach a message that God is waiting on you and because he's waiting on you he's got something in store for your life that is beyond what the Bible says what no eye is seen and what no ear is heard and what no mind has conceived the things that God has in store for those who love him so we're going to tap into that today just tell your neighbor real quick get ready come on get ready Mark chapter 16 verse 9 through 14 and it speaks this it's just now when he rose early on the first day of the week speaking about Jesus it said he appeared first to Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven [Music] should be a comforting scripture for those of you that are lingering with maybe five I want to tell you today Jesus said I can at least take out seven it says that he first appeared in to Mary Magdalene and she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her the Bible says they would not believe it [Music] after these things he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking in two a country it says and they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them the last verse verse 14 says and afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table and he rebuked him for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believe those who saw him after he had risen I want to come from the title today believe again believe again can we pray father in the name of Jesus we are declaring in this space today that we will believe again [Music] for that in which you have spoken that in which you have testified to and that which is true today in Jesus name we declare somebody say amen amen thank you so much musicians real quick can you help me give it up for our Dream Team that's making all of this happen today can y'all help me celebrate people that have contributed to this moment and this experience I want to talk about this I think I believe and I I think it's important that I share on the topic of this moment is because I believe that our beliefs are at Jeopardy I believe that the season and time that we're in that the enemy is being very crafty in what he does that he is putting us in a place where he's making us question our belief system he's making us question do we believe what God says do we believe what the word of God testifies to the resurrected Jesus Christ do we believe in what this word says and what he is trying to do is mess with our mind somebody say he's messing with my mind he's messing with my mind oftentimes because the place where I react and move out of is the conscious level of the way in which I think my thinking controls my actions in the way that I think speaks to the way that I believe and if he can control the way that I am thinking he can control the way that I'm acting and I believe today that he's trying to control now I I will say this to you is that oftentimes if you're like me you find yourself in a situation where you cannot believe some of the things that have taken place in your life and some of the things that you yourself have done you don't want to say it but that's the side of you that nobody knows side of you you always go back to remember what the Lord has done that's the only testimony you had is because God has delivered you from you because if you know you you a little crazy in your law no you got some pass so what you do is you try to move on to a new company of people so that you can say no I'm straight I'm saying I'm good but if we met some of your former friends foreign s before you knew Jesus that no friends before you were quoting them scriptures but the friends before you you you you had that self-control that fruit of the spirit if we could just get a hold of her if we could just talk to him we would see a side of you that we don't even know [Applause] and we would be wondering do you know Jesus foreign I'll never forget one time when I was growing up we attended church multiple times during the week and I'll never forget right before Thanksgiving right before Thanksgiving we we had Wednesday night service I don't know if you come from where either but I come from a good old Apostolic church and and and we had good old Wednesday service and it did not matter if the day after was Thanksgiving we was going to serve God and we would go worship God and make sure we got that praise in on Thanksgiving you can't not have church right before Thanksgiving and not give thanks to God and so I'll never forget y'all we were we were coming from church on on on on on on Wednesday night and I was in the car with my mother anybody know that I'm an inquisitive kind of guy I I never forget I was a small young kid and I and I never forget we we parked in the alley because if you're from the city you don't even use the front door you use the alley of where you you park in the alley and so I'm parked in the alley and and my mom and my aunts and our family they're unloading groceries because thanksgiven's tomorrow and they're about to tear it up y'all and I'm excited and everybody's over but I'm inquisitive because I'm interested about things that I don't know I I look at a car that my mom has just purchased recently and I attacks her because I've seen her watch her with her all the time she has the gear shift in the gear shift it has to pee and it has the aura and it has the D and I I make sense out of those but I'm interested to know what is that in so I said Ma what's that what's you know what does that mean and she said it's neutral oh okay neutral everything's cool there back then the technology of cars is a little bit different right because now in order to shift gears and I know you have to press on the brake in order to shift well we hadn't gotten there yet technology was not that advanced yet and so I'm sitting in the car and they're going back and forth to the car and my interest is bubbling I'm in the back seat and I'm looking neutral neutral neutral what does that mean what what does neutral do does it transform the car does it what does this neutral do well the problem is they took too long coming back to the car and I believe if you want to know something [Applause] then you need to figure it out for yourself my mom's pretty new car in the alley after service by myself I said let's find out what neutral is I make hand on the control and I'd slightly because it's my story I I slightly shift it to neutral the problem is if you know anything about a good alley in Baltimore is that alleys don't go straight alleys go down [Music] and neutral and a hill don't work together well that was my first roller coaster I put that bad boy in neutral to move and down the alley it went as it's moving I could not believe that I was in a car that was moving but there was nobody else in there with me the car shoots down the alley in the middle of the night and Rams in two our neighbor's yard destroying all of their fits you talking about belief the way my mother came out said oh God you're all right oh my God I cannot believe that you did that I'm rammed into the fence the car has pushed over the fence the neighbors y'all know how the neighbors got to come out everybody starts peeking through the blinds you know what is that crash hits everybody comes out [Music] I'm in there how many of you know I slept late and it wasn't because I was tired I wasn't getting up I don't know Thanksgiving was for me or not here's the context to the understanding is I cannot believe that at a young age I would do something like that I cannot believe that I would attempt in this world to do and to move in a way that I had no clue about but the problem is is that you don't get to see anything further than where you are when you stop believing that you can do something Beyond Where You Are I'm interested today because the story and caption that we read is that Jesus has disciple these 11 disciples that are currently with Judas being gone the Bible says that that he told them for three years I'm going away I'm going to die but I'm coming back again I'm going away I'm going to die but I'm coming back again I'm going away I'm going to die but I'm coming back again the Bible lets us know when Jesus is crucified and they see him laying it says they go into hiding because they stopped believing can I introduce you something real quick from the time that Jesus died to the time he rose there were no Christians you're like wait what yeah because the context is no one believed the Bible says that the women came back to the Grave so that they could prepare the burial better than what it was when they rushed him off the cross to get into the grave because it was the weekend and the weekend meant that the Jews had to be able to observe what was happening over the weekend so in that context the Bible says that they go back to the Grave not in anticipation but to make sure Jesus is buried well and what they let us know is is that there are no disciples waiting there yeah [Music] I'm getting somewhere just tell your neighbor he getting somewhere I'm text I want to get to you things that God has spoken in your life that he keeps speaking and that he keeps revealing but you have stopped believing because the set of circumstances that are around your life seem as if they have broken your area of belief because you have no more room to see that God can do it because it looks like God is dead and you stop believing in the power of what he can do because you believe that even though he told you he would never leave you nor forsake you you must be the exception to what he said but I'm here today to inform somebody that God has not gone anywhere he's right where he said he would be now if I can get this to you the problem that we oftentimes have is that we are a people who operate out of what we see and set up what we believe and because we only operate out of what we see we limit ourselves to what God can do in our life because the Bible says that faith is the substance of things that are hoped for it is the evidence of things that I have not seen why would God try to do something in your life that you've already seen when he's a god of miracosa and a god of things you've never seen in your life before I'm trying to tell you God needs to hide what he's doing to make sure that your faith can rise up to the situation of what he wants to do in your life I'm trying to tell you today that the enemy has been working so well to distract you because he's playing with your mind keep you from believing that that in which God has spoken is already yes and amen so he creates a distraction that seems so severe to you that you begin to waver in your belief can he do what he said he can do and now we find ourselves focused in our situation mourning and weeping about what we believe has taken place but yet we don't know that the Bible said in three days she was going to rise again if they had gone back and read if they had gone back and taken a moment to review what the prophets had told what Jeremiah had spoken what they had spoken in Isaiah they would have understood this was only a temporary thing but if they could have grasped a hold of their mind to reach an understanding that if I could just hold on just a little bit longer I would recognize that he is not dead he is yet alive and living and moving and breathing calm down Marcus [Applause] because the idea is that the enemy wants to get you so buried in you that you have no space to believe that God could do anything else because it's beyond the capacity of what he has the power to do he is a deaf defeating God if you understood the power that lies in him beyond what your ability your skill set your resume your degree can do for you you would recognize it in a very quick instance that I can't beat the blessings that God has over my life but it requires me to believe by faith that he is able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that said work somebody say in me ah the belief is not about it being in someone else the belief is about it being in me and the work that he's trying to do is a work of belief so that I stop getting distracted every time life happens to stop believing that the God who promised me everything that he said before the foundation of the world he can still do it today just tell your liver real quick he can still do it I'm here to let you know even though you don't see it even though it looks like he's dead even though there is a stoner over the grave of your blessing he is a God that removes all barriers he is a God that goes beyond the infinite into the finite he is the god that moves Beyond time he is Jehovah he is Elohim he can do anything he wants to do he is my provider he is my Waymaker so whatever he says it is already declared yes and amen but I want to get you to this point today so that you understand very clearly it said why you sit and weep and mourn about what's happening to you in this moment right now he's working it out I was looking for a band I was about to shout right there see you don't understand the space between what looks like the end and what is the beginning the Bible said they they hid and they they mourned and they wept because they didn't believe there is a place to where your attendance will not keep you in the trials of life but it must be that you can weather the storm because you have a firm foundation in Jesus Christ well where's that Firm Foundation coming from it's coming from my belief method that I first understand that Jesus is the son of God and he was crucified for my sins yet being crucified he rose again with all power in his hand and he no longer has to worry about death over our lives because he has removed death and we're living in eternity if you understood John 3 16 that says for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever would believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life you would understand that death is no longer the cause of what I have to be a blessing in my life death cannot hold me down it doesn't matter what comes my way I already understand that the promises for me I believe [Applause] but I've got to learn to believe again because the enemy is really good at making sure that you have enough problems in your life that distract you from believing it is the context of what already happened in the Book of Genesis Genesis chapter 3 it starts out and it already lets us know that Satan speaks to Eve and he says this word did God actually did God actually because when disappointment Hits and The Trials of this life wear you down you go back into the promise that you have to write down and say to God are you sure this is what you said and the enemy is whispering in your ear did God fully because what he's trying to do is test your faith to a level where you stop believing and when you stop believing you stop anticipating and having expectation of the promise that God has for your life but I'm here today to let you know is that you don't have to worry about what happened in the garden anymore because what happened on the cross put me back in good sanding and what I do believe is that he actually said I am an overcomer I am a Waymaker he is a God who can do more than I can imagine or think he can change my life he can heal he can break my mind free he can free me of depression he is God so when God comes and it reminds you of the vision but the enemy comes right behind him and remind you of your circumstances and says did God actually that's why scripture lets us know in the Old Testament to write division down and make it plain so those that read it and here they can run sometimes you got to run if you connect the scripture the Bible says you should run from Temptation temptation is not that only which is trying to gain you and to pull you from a lustful mindset it is to pull you from the purpose and plan that God has set over your life to tempt you to settle for ordinary when God has called you to extraordinary things I'm trying to say this to you right now if you can understand in this moment and if you can understand the clarity of what God is speaking God is saying I need you to revoke the voice of the enemy that tries to come and to push you to the side and try to let you know that things are not what they seem to be I'm here to let you know today if God promised it over your life it has already been declared yes and amen what you need to activate it is the activation of Faith to believe that if he said it he'll do it the Bible lets us know faith without works is and thank you so the reason you don't get to see it is because you don't believe it and the reason you don't believe it is because the enemy is playing tricks with your mind y'all know that's all my mind playing tricks on me like a place season here's what I want to tell you about Seasons seasons are temporary so stop adding permanent solutions to Temporary things thank you it's just for a moment it didn't work out the way I thought it was Pastor then if he told you he was going to do it that means the timing was off and it wasn't what it was supposed to be in this moment but what you have to do is stop I was about to say something say it you have to stop wimping out every time it doesn't go your way [Applause] you know pastor this marriage is over he will not yell at me like that [Applause] I want I will not do this I will I will leave now what what did you sign up for did you sign up for a promise that you thought was going to happen because you were just there it required you to believe beyond what you feel is going to take place so happen and you've got to put yourself in position where the walk that you're living out is no longer a walk that's predicated on what you feel because here's the thing the enemy cares nothing about your feelings and your blessing cares nothing about your feelings just waiting on you to be not weary and not faint for in due season you you faint not stop passing out every time it gets hold you oh god oh it's like oh wake up you saw the Bible they went into hiding they was like no we're not doing this he did we um no we gotta do something else and I gave up fishing Lord Jesus help me because what God calls for you to give up is such a sacrifice to you that you don't understand the greater blessing that he has on the other side God has put you in the sphere of people that are always trying to get you to see what you don't see of yourself while you deny what you see and claim what you're comfortable to do oh we love that you know I see a leader in you no Pastor not right now just right now it's not the season for me to leave I don't I don't have the ability my capacity is right now I have some things that I want to fill and do and it's like okay I'm sorry I even talked to you in this foreign because half the time you're not seeing in yourself but God has placed people around you to see so you're living off of the vision that you saw without God and you're working on the vision that you found to be obtainable so now you're living an attainable life without a miracle-working god and he's a God that raises from the dead he's not interested in doing what you can already do for yourself he's interested in exceeding the expectations of what you could even imagine or think but the problem is is that we have created a box that so well fits our life and that produces what we want the problem is is once we get there we notice it's not as well as we thought it would be and what he's saying today is I want to do something greater I want us to believe again whether this is you believing for the first time because here's the thing the seed of belief is on the inside of you but the seat of belief must sprout into the plant that has the potential to Bear the fruit that God wants to do within you so that what he does within you is not just about it being for you and what he can exceed beyond what you can think is an ability to make you a world changer but beyond what they ever thought these guys were sitting in the room weeping and crying not knowing they were about to change the world see what you don't know in C that can't come out because fear and interpretation and anxiety and depression keep it at Bay because you believe this is who you are and God is saying I've come to make all things new but because we settle for where we are and we settle for what we want to see we'll just be like I'll take this and God is saying today I have more in store for your life than you've ever thought possible I just need you to be able to tell your neighbor real quick just believe I need you to believe again I need to see a belief to come in you again I need you to stop walking around so fearful and stop walking around so caught in what you think might happen because you're so a fear of death and dirt your life is all about death well I can't do that I can't get I can't go I want to I can't go not down there not around there gotta live over there gotta do it over there I can't be around that won't go there and God's like so what what will you do [Applause] because the restrictions that you place on your life are now in the barriers in the walls of your life that keep you from being who God's called you to be and you're settling for being miserable in a state that you don't have to live in Pastor can he do that he can but you have to that's why the title of our series is I think I believe because we have a ton of Christians who are walking around believing just enough so that their salvation stays intact but their testimony lacks in power the only thing that you're going to get out of Walking With Jesus is that you'll see him when you die and he's going to say to you well what you do you're like God I didn't do much because I lacked what belief I believed in my job so much that they would take care of me that I gave them everything and gave you nothing I believe that what I have and what I own and what I've received is so precious to me that I believe I have to take care of it and I don't understand I don't own it I just Steward it can I tell a parent in here that that child that you have that you're so in love with I got a 20 year old they're close to you but then later they start finding other people they like you like never I'm like pretty sure [Applause] [Music] and your life becomes totally drowned in what you now believe is the most important thing and God says you put nothing before me wow that's right if you keep everything where it's supposed to be I'll bless it I'll put my hand over it cover you in it but when you make it above me when you lose focus when you understand everything that I have built into this moment has never been about you but it's always been about me he says the distractions of this life will keep you from fulfilling the purpose that have called you to the first thing I want to let you know is that you're called to believe when you don't understand that's our first point for today you got to believe when you don't understand because the problem is is that we're in a world that tells you understand it then believe have it all together figure it out then you believe and what Jesus is calling you is to a faith to believe when you don't always understand that's why we believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and understand our faith lingers in his resurrection not in the Bible our faith is in the testimony that Jesus rose from the grave and our faith is settled in that testimony that even when we don't understand I'm good it when we don't understand and even when we're in the moments of life where things a pressure on us to say do you know or don't you know here's what I want to say to you and let you know is that you cannot let what you don't know change your beliefs foreign I'm not taking Jesus all away believe in the resurrected Jesus for what we don't comprehend and don't understand why Pastor gonna be real ignorant right now you read your Bible anyway so stop worrying about them dinosaurs anyway thank you I'm just saying I passed away you got to explain it to me you got to make it make sense I want to let you know what my job is my job is to convey the gospel not to convince you to follow Jesus I am not a Salesman of who Christ is and what he has already done it is my job to convey the message of Hope of what God has done is doing and will do in this age to come but I want to clearly let you know I am not a Salesman for Jesus why because I have my own testimony of who he is the testimony lets me know that even in the midst of a deathbed God can still Raise Me Up even in the midst of feeling lonely and broken and dealing with anxiety and the pressures of life God can still motivate move my mind and take me to a new place even when I'm in my darkest and hardest moments of life he is still able it's my testimony my testimony goes beyond my explanation and for the person that is hinging their eternity on what they can understand oh I promise you there are things you can't even understand that are on this Earth let alone things that are spiritual that you're trying to grasp a hold of I want to let you know today don't you base your belief on what you think you know you will miss out on what God has in store for your life because your comprehension and your hard hearts don't allow you to cross over into the supernatural of what God wants to do and speak over your life [Applause] scripture tells us Proverbs chapter 3 and 5 it says this trust in and rely confidently on the Lord with all somebody say all underline it in your Bible highlight it write a circle around it put flares up put Emojis up put Thumbs Up Click It Like It copy it it says with all Pastor I'm having a hard time you got to let all Pastor there's a moment you got to have all you can't be somewhat somewhat get you to the place where you're trying to find where all the boundary lines are that you can still be like Jesus and still be like you anybody ever been there before how much Pastor real quick how many drinks is too many anyways I don't I don't know like when he say don't get drunk so for me y'all think this is a game I've had people explain this so to me I really don't get drunk off of wine right you'd be like for real I'm I'm sitting there staring like okay so because I can handle it right a bottle is good I wait you're you're trying to figure out how far you can go back to the old you [Music] before it requires you to do anything greater you're not going to have a great walk let me tell you why because you're always going to live at the minimum of what God has for you the minimum belief the minimum blessing the minimum requirement of Faith the minimum of what I'm supposed to transform into everything will be at the minimum level be because you're trying to hold on to the previous you that's all those questions say it just says I'm trying to see how much of me I can keep without losing me because I think so well of me that I don't want to become new because new will make me different but the reason that you came to him is because you knew you were lost so why are you holding on to the old you to be the thing that you try to grasp as much as you can when the old you was living miserably anyway it says do not rely on your own Insight or understanding because you think you're smart you know how many people I've had given me Bible scriptures and verses they have no idea about Pastor real quick they told me this scripture means what you think you think I can get away with it why are you trying to get away with the old you when the Bible says you're supposed to be producing fruits of the spirit and you're trying to produce fruits of the flesh that's where we got religion and relationship messed up in a relationship you're sacrificing for the purpose of the relationship that you're in and the person in whom you love you're not sacrificing because you have to you're sacrificing for the benefit of the relationship and what can come out of it when you give up yourself the idea that I'm trying to get as much as myself into the relationship with Jesus when he says you're already jacked up and you keep trying to add more of you into it lets me know you're not ready for change you're just ready for heaven foreign without an Earthly purpose um Point number two you're called to believe when you can't see how many of us just if if he could just show us he even got to tell us anybody good with that like you don't even have to tell me can you just show me like if you just showed me I'd be I would be good with that just just show me how this is going to end just anybody I mean you just want to be honest I would be like just if you could just show me I can take it from here anybody got an Ikea spirit you're like just show me what the picture looks like got it from here I walk into Ikea Spirit often Lord real quick just show me like no you don't have to tell me and it's like no if you seek me diligently you'll find me yeah yeah I get that we'll talk can you just show me can you just show me what to do I'm good with that because I know how to assemble according to the picture that's on the box if you could just tell me the vision I put it together and then like Ikea you got 19 Parts left talking about it's all together and everybody's looking at you like I'm not sleeping on that bed I'm not sleeping on that why it's got too many parts left over the manufacturer knows what's needed for what he created stop assembling your own life and follow the instructions that he's already placed inside of you and stop making up your own version that has your children at risk because those bunk beds got three screws holding 17 Parts together here's the problem when you do that you put other people's lives on the line the Bible lets us know in second Corinthians 5 and 7 it says this we live by what we believe will happen not by what we can see we live by what we believe not what we can see on point number three I got to say this to somebody in here because we come to these moments because you got to believe when there's nothing left when you're empty when you're out when you're done when you're disappointed when every prayer that you have prayed seems to have gone the opposite Ray of what you've asked God to do when it seems like God has deserted you left you forgot about you thought no more about you letting you drown in your own mistakes your own mess-ups your own addictions your own wrong decisions your own lustful States your own broken mindsets and when you think All Is Lost here's what I'm telling you Don't Stop Believing you got to believe when there's nothing left when you're empty when the gas tank is hit as my mom and I we were talking the other day and she said I got up to do something and I wasn't motivated I didn't have any affirmations and I didn't feel like it you have got to steal trust when YouTube can't give you a morning feeling when you're lying there dead saying I don't want to do this you've got to but still believe [Music] some of you have asked the question and I know the Lord is speaking this in my heart some of you have asked a question why should I keep going on what's the reason some of us have had tragedies in our life that could stop us right where we are and say I'm done what's the reason to keep going none of this has worked out in my benefit [Music] this Christian walk this thing this served Jesus and he'll do all of these miraculous and wonderful things guess what Pastor it didn't work out that way for me it didn't work out that way for my family and my children and and my husband and my wife and my mother and my father it didn't work the way that I thought and what he says still you trusted me lean not to your own understanding when you get the report and the diagnosis isn't changing I still trust you I believe it's no longer on a yes in every prayer that I pray
