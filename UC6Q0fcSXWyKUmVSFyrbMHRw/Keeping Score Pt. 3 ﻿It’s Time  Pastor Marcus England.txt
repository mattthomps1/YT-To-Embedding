we're on week three and we've been talking through a series on forgiveness and we've been talking about keeping score uh that's one of the things that I think it's prominent that you understand is that as we operate out of this place of forgiveness is that Jesus is throwing away any scorecard and he's letting us know that he's called for us to be forgiven as we forgive I think that's something that is amazing that as we are been forgiven we're called what to forgive the Bible says as you forgive others so will your father forgive you today and I want to jump into the scriptures uh it's one of my scriptures that I've Loved this testimony that John gives of Jesus and it's encountered with the disciples post him rising from the grave his resurrection has taken place and Jesus is connecting with his disciples over and over Through Time time well what has happened previous to Jesus crucifixion is that there has been this discontent between him and and Peter not on Jesus side but on Peter's side because Peter remembers how he denied Jesus Peter in a moment where Jesus was being held at the high priest's home was Acts aren't you one of those who followed him aren't you a friend of the rabbi and he spoke and said three times I do not know him I Can Only Imagine that as something as hard as being denied being denied by the one in whom said they would go to the Cross they would die they would go to jail they would do whatever it took to be with you there's nothing like when people make a promise in life and and they can't really fulfill that promise and so this is an opportunity because Peter since his time with Jesus we don't know that there has been a Reconciliation Peter has found himself in a place where he's dealing with most likely guilt and the hardships of denying the saber and Peter is dealing with will Jesus ever use them again I'm here to talk to someone today because you're wondering will God ever use me in my Brokenness in the things that I've done and the ways that I've lived out my life in in the secrets that I've had in in the people that I've hurt will he still use me or for those of us that have been hurt and find ourselves not seeing ourselves Worthy you're asking yourself well Jesus ever use me I think in John chapter 21 as we open God's word and and we understand this testimony that John gives he gives us a recount that Peter and the disciples John as well are on a boat and they're fishing polite some time before Jesus calling them they're catching nothing if I can tell you is that hardship or embarrassment or shame can move us out of the place where we were accelerating in our purpose and growth to a place where we go back to where we were some of us have been delivered set free we're walking in a better life but when things get tough we always look to go back to that in which we know and that's what Peter did Peter found himself fishing again when Jesus had called him to be a fisher of men when we read in scripture Jesus is speaking from the shore and he has told him to throw their net over for catch the Bible says that they they throw the net over and they pull in the cat so much that it almost begins to sink the boat the Bible says when Peter looks up and says the one who loved Jesus meaning John John says it's the master Peter anxious and feeling like he needs this moment with Jesus the Bible says he puts on His Garment and he jumps out of the boat and he runs to the shore half the time of them eating and and spending time together talked about that you've gotta you gotta be accessible and you got to have a desire but can I be honest sometimes where we have landed in life we find it ourselves are at a place where we don't know what to say to Jesus anybody ever been there before you don't know how to get back to a place you feel spiritually or or you feel like you've let God down or or you just don't know what to say or what to do and Peter just gets around Jesus where we pick up in verse 15 it says this it says and when they had finished breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you love me more than these he said to him yes Lord you know that I love you he said to him feed my Lambs he said to him a second time Simon son of John do you love me he said to him yes Lord you know that I love you he said to him ten my sheep he said to him a third time Simon son of John do you love me when John lets us know Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time do you love me and he said to him Lord you know everything can can I have you underline that can I have you highlight that can I have you at this moment just to pull that out he said Lord you know everything I want to speak that to someone today who thinks they've been in hiding who thinks that God is unaware of where they are who thinks that they're out of the view of God and the Bible lets us know you you can go to the depths of Hell or to the highest place and he will still be there okay he said you know that I love you Jesus said to him feed my sheep truly truly I say to you when you were young you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go this he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God after saying this he said to him two words follow me I wanted to come from the title today it's time I love that already right there I could just go in and preach right there it's time y'all I think Michael Jackson had a song called it was time listen everybody's always talking about it's time for something to happen but I want to speak to you today now is the moment now is the day this is the opportunity it's time I want to implore you in this moment it's time past we may say well what is it time for it's time for you to be healed and come to God for he has a purpose for your life can we pray father in the name of Jesus we are so grateful in this moment that you've allowed for us to be a part of this space at this time there's a word that you want to speak to your people so I pray that our hearts and our minds are available to you so that you can do whatever it is that you want to do in Us in Jesus name come on somebody say a man a man a man listen I'm so grateful I'm grateful for this opportunity to speak to this moment because I think it's time I think it's an opportunity for us as Christians for us as followers of Jesus Christ for us as disciples to stop running and follow him I think it's important that we understand that Jesus is not concerned about who we used to be he's concerned about who we are becoming and who we are right now I think in the moment as I I I talk about this opportunity of reconciliation that's happening between Jesus and Peter I think about how long does it take you to make amends to forgive someone how long does it take you to to come past and just say I apologize or I'm sorry how long does it take you anybody ever been there before my wife and I we we might have an argument in the house and and and we find ourselves at that silent place I don't know if you know about the silent treatment if you're if you're married but we we we're in the silent place we walk past one another excuse me excuse me we walk past and you know what do you need help no I don't need you to get it I have it myself you know what I noticed that happens and in times of disagreement or times of unforgiveness is that we become very prideful and very selfish we become all about ourselves and what's going to be what's best for us and what's going to take care of us and I want to let you know is that in this moment Peter could only see his own hurt and his own Brokenness I'm gonna give you two sides sometimes we can only see the offense and sometimes we can only see the offended and we don't recognize that this is an opportunity that God is giving us to move from one who is offended or the offender to one who is healed and called by the purpose and the power of Jesus Christ oh my goodness I think about this because in this opportunity and moment where it's time I believe we have the time to do it but here's oftentimes what we do is we procrastinate on the healing that God has for our lives because healing takes work and work means I've got to be involved I've got to admit something I've got to say something I've got to be able to pull up something I've got to think through something I've got to be honest about something and honestly to move forward in your life it's going to take some work Peter finding himself at this space is like us because oftentimes if we want to be truthful we like keeping score and keeping score gives us the permission to hold somebody accountable to what they did even after they apologize anybody know about keeping score you keep score back in the day we would you would keep score about the things that people remember what she said and remember what she did and remember how that used to be and we do I remember that one time when you said that I remembered the second time and what we would tell people you got a third strike and on your third strike you are out I don't care who you are you're not gonna hurt me once shame on me shame on you hurt me twice what we say shame on what me because it means I ought to have it together by now I think it's interesting that we had this moment with Peter because Peter is one who back in scripture asks Jesus how many times do we have to forgive someone Peter said is it seven anybody ever know you you count the number close because that's the number you're at I'm pretty sure that Peter was fed up with somebody he could have been one of the disciples and he was at number six and he was like Lord I got one more and left in me and Jesus says no it says seven he times seven he just says wait you you want me to forgive someone 77 times it wasn't even a number because that's 77 times obviously you got to forget counting after that how many times has this person offended you I don't know it's so many I can't even count how many times has this person disappointed you I don't know it's too many to be able to count Jesus says that's what the true meaning of love that's what the true meaning of forgiveness is it does not have an end and I think it's time for you to understand that whatever it is that you're holding over someone or whatever it is that you refuse to admit it's holding up you moving forward to what God has called for you to do I want to talk about this lack of forgiveness I want to talk about why you are still dealing with the trauma and the hurt and the pain of your past and why the hurt and pain of your past is keeping you from moving forward I want to tell somebody now is the time it's not the time when you get an apology it's not the time when when you find out the reason and the meaning behind why someone did what they did I want to tell you now is the time to forgive and to let go now is the time for you to see what's inside of you that whatever it is that you're holding it's rotting you out whatever it is that you have on the inside it's keeping you from getting all that God has for you now is the time to release and let go just write in the comment section real quick now is the time it's time I think it's the time for you to understand that wow you had the opportunity it is called for you not to waste it on the things that don't even matter anymore that person is long gone that person is dead that person is far away from you and yet you are still suffering because you won't forgive or you want to ask for forgiveness I think about oftentimes if I didn't know early in my first years when it came to marriage I would have forgiven or asked for forgiveness the latter is probably the one that is the most I would have asked for it a lot faster can I tell you what time does and unforgiveness it builds resentment and it builds Pride and it builds a wall and a barrier in you that when it would have been easier at the beginning it's harder at the end can I get real serious with you like can I really tell you that there are often times that many of us have found that abuse has taken place and our lives are in the lives of someone else and we don't know how to forgive and time has brought such a barrier in our hearts that we don't really know if we can forgive and I'll say this to you today it's that unforgiveness is a root of hurt and Brokenness inside of you you may be saying pastor I've learned to deal with it and I've never even said anything and I hold that person to it and I'm saying to you today it is rotting your soul it is keeping you and your anxiety it is keeping you in your depression it is keeping you in your addictness you think you've moved on but it is keeping you where you are because it doesn't allow you to break free and anything that has you under bondage means that you're no longer free some of us are on unforgiveness house the rest we're no longer thinking about what happened but we have a reminder that we can't go but so far because we're under probation of Brokenness some of us want to go far some of us have dreams and visions and and we see ourselves going Beyond and we see our children going Beyond and we see our community going behind but the problem is is that we're wearing unforgiveness on ourselves and every time that we try to go further hurt sets in distrust sets in anger sets in the inability to walk away sets in blame sets in and we self sabotage our own success and our own Direction because were caught in unforgiveness Jesus knew that what he did on the cross was an immediate direct result of the Father's Love For Us and Jesus knew there was no way for what he had just done that he could lead Peter where he was so he calls him and that's Peter as a part of this moment he begins to say to him Peter son of John I like that Jesus calls him with ancestry behind him because ancestry means that there is a humanism in him that defines the idea that Peter is imperfect and dust just like everyone else on Earth says Peters son of John do you love me more than these and tells them he says you're called to feed my Lambs I want to say to somebody today your purpose lies in your reconciliation to God you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing your your occupying the job you're you're you're you're you're making money you're you're doing good in your occupation in life but you are absent of your purpose you've got where you're going in the next five years you got how you're going to climb up the corporate ladder you got the dreams but you're lacking purpose and here's the reason why because in your bondage is a wall to the clarity of your freedom Jesus said as you forgive others so your father in heaven will forgive you my question today is in this moment in opportunity in time what is God trying to do in your life that you're rejecting him because of your unforgiveness what is God speaking what is God declaring what is God saying in your life that you cannot hear because you are clouded with unforgiveness it is amazing that we think we can hear the voice of God when we don't have the heart of God it is amazing that we think we can overcome with our own humility and our own Pride but the problem is is that there's a wall in front of us that keeps us from moving forward one of the first things that I want you to understand is point number one forgiving people are themselves forgiven ah here here's the clarity that I want to give you for forgiving people on themselves forgiven you've got to remember that you are being forgiven the way that you're forgiving other people oh why is that so big because oftentimes We Believe while we're forgiving other people we're perfect and if I can be honest with you you're not perfect and neither am I we've got to come to the understanding that the people around us are imperfect imagine chapter 6 verse 12 said this and forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debt towards letting go of both the wrong and the resentment why is this so big I'm trying to tell you and preach this to you because it feels so good it's the understanding that the world is broken say it with me this world is broken which means they're broken people and you're included in that number oftentimes we're looking at everybody else and seeing everybody else smoke it but we don't understand and that the father is forgiving us daily some of us hourly some of us minutely that's right I just made that up minute Lee God is forgiving us for our wrongs constantly for our broken thoughts constantly for our ways that are not his ways constantly for the places that we should not be constantly for the things we should not be involved in constantly but we would have the gall to hold people and be unforgiving to people when our heavenly father is forgiving of us Peter's Journey before him will require a different kind of Peter I want to tell you today is that forgiving people are themselves forgiven because through forgiveness they grow they mature they learn and they use that as a part of their journey of what God's called for them to do there is no way Peter could have been an apostle who could not forgive so Peter himself was forgiven can I tell you Peter thinking that he knew and Peter feeling like he was in charge and Peter feeling like Lord whatever happens to you I'll go there as well Peter had a self-confidence that was not grounded in humility and that confidence showed up when he denied Jesus the Bible says three times It Feels Like Jesus could have kept score when Peter ran over he could say hey Peter I just want to go over the instance what happened to you when you left what happened when we got to the high priest's home and they asked you don't you know him aren't you with him and you denied me what happened I want to speak to some of us today who are so bent on the details that it keeps us from seeing the purpose that God has I want you to understand that God is calling for you to be healed not for you to be correct or informed it's calling for healing to take place in your mind your body and your soul Peter was willing to forgive and receive forgiveness what's a part of his apostleship now Jesus could change him see here here's the thing Jesus can't change you when your heart is hard he can't change you when there's for no forgiveness inside of you he cannot change you when you're not at a place of humility now Jesus could talk to Peter when he told Peter I will tell you what to eat when it's time for you to eat it he says in the next thing go to cornelius's house wait wait Jesus is Cornelius not a Jew it's like wait wait I don't I don't go to Gentiles houses I don't I don't meet people that are not like me I don't do things that are not like your will I don't find myself in the place where I'm meeting other people who don't think like I Think Jesus says in order for you to do my will and to do my work you have to go through what it is to forgive and be forgiven I think it's something special to the fact that Peter In This Moment has found himself at a place where he's humble before the mighty hand of God and he says do you love me Peter do you do you love me more than these do you love me and Peter's like Lord you know you know you've corrected me so many times when I've already been wrong you know if I love you Jesus says I want you to get it's not about your will but it's my will that must be done I think today as we forgive and as God forgives us we develop and become those who walk according to his will and his purpose my question today is are you easy are you easy to be available when God speaks to be obedient to his will are you are you the one that struggles with the responsibility to hear God and be obedient to what he's called for you to do I can tell you a root of that Disobedience can come with a heart heart and a heart heart can come from hurt and hurt can come from past and it all can rest in a person who does not know how to forgive I'm going to tell you today it's not about you going to wait for somebody to forgive you or to wait for someone to come and apologize to you it's about you being a forgiving person with the heart of God we just said it all last week when Jesus was on the cross and we said he said to them what forgive them Father for they know not what they do are you willing to forgive people who have not even acknowledged that they need forgiveness are you willing to deal with individuals who haven't even acknowledged that they're in the wrong I'm here today to let you know God's call to make you brand new in him to give you a new heart Point number two forgiving people understand imperfect people I just want to let you know all of us a little cray-cray all of us got a little something messed up in the head all of us are at a place in our life where we think we're perfect when we get older but the truth of the matter is we probably are making more mistakes because we're forgetting more than ever before can I can I share with you that that forgiving people understand imperfect people if I could ask you today just to write in the comment section are you imperfect you have to say I actually am I don't have it all together I want to let you know I don't have it all together I'm not perfect at every moment I don't have it all scripted out well I want to tell you that I never make mistakes but that wouldn't be truthful I need you to understand that Jesus understood he was working with imperfect disciples and that has not changed the imperfect disciples that are here today are the same people that Jesus is working with and he's saying even in spite of your mess-ups even in spite of where you are I plan for it I framed it out in your life it says all the days of your life were written in a book he knew that you would be imperfect can I say this today if Jesus is letting you off the hook won't you let somebody else off the hook I know you think you got it together I know you think they should have it by now I think that's one of the biggest issues that we have in a council culture where we live is because we believe that people have a score a number of times that they're able to mess up and after that score we cut them off we canceled them we put them away and we say they're no longer to be used but I'm here today to let you know if Jesus Took score of how many times you and I messed up we will find ourselves in a place that we would be in a negative in a deficit not understanding that God has been gracious enough to us he does not reward us he does not deal with us according to our transgressions and sins he does not deal with us according to our mess-ups he does not deal with us according to the way we think in our mind in the way that we treat our body and the way that we talk to people what comes in our mouth he is a gracious and a healing God do I have any people that have a mindset and a different way of thinking and a different way of living that says God if he's willing to forgive me I'm willing to forgive others if he's willing to see me right where I am I'm willing to see others right where they are do I have any Perfect People willing to love other imperfect people I believe today as a church as a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world the only way we can do that is walk into a church and say literally this church is imperfect because I'm in here myself I stopped looking for everyone else to blame I stopped looking for individuals to find that mess up things and I start seeing me I start seeing what part can I play how can I make this happen what difference can I make and I'm seeing it today for giving people understand imperfect people and perfect people that don't get it all right and perfect people that don't always clarify what they mean and Perfect People and I will say to you they never did anything wrong can I be honest Jesus said it's easy to love those who love you but he said love your enemies he said pray for those who despitefully use you he says forgive he doesn't say who to forgive he says just forgive today I'm interested in this moment that we have because the idea behind it is is how can you forgive a traitor how can you forgive somebody that denies you how can you forgive somebody that saw you yeah can I be funny with you right now how are you gonna forgive somebody who saw you on the bus stop and drove past like could you forgive somebody that did that like they saw you I saw you see me see you can you forgive somebody can you find yourself at the place where everything that's happening in your life isn't taken to Heart can you find yourself in the place where everything that's happening to you you don't you don't place it at the top and and live off of that but can you find yourself being forgiven can you find yourself that if you were on the bus stop and they rode past you and then you get a car and you see them on the bus stop are you gonna do unto them as they did unto you is there something about who you are is there something about the transformation that's taken place on the inside of you that has you at a place that you can never imagine or think that says God I'll follow you and be obedient Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4-5 says this but God being so very rich in Mercy because of his great and wonderful love which he loved us even when we were spiritually dead and separated from him because of our sins he made us spiritually alive somebody say I'm alive it says together with him Christ for By His grace his undeserved favor and mercy you have been saved from God's judgment oh my goodness the Bible says you've been saved from God's judgment you understand that it is by God's grace it's very it says rich and mercy that you are where you are you do understand it wasn't because you had it all together it wasn't because of how smart you were it wasn't because of how disciplined you were it wasn't because you had it all together it was because of his Rich Mercy now last point point number three forgiven people live beyond themselves man I love that I love the opportunity in a moment to understand that forgiving people don't live out of Preference they live out of somebody's their purpose it's purpose I'm living out of the purpose that God has set over my life I'm not looking for the flaws I'm looking to come in and love the flaws I'm looking to come in and help I'm looking to come in and be a blessing too many times we're trying to assess a situation and a place to find out all of its imperfections and God says no I'm calling to you for you to live beyond yourself oh I could never I could never do this I could never live here I could never be here this is beyond me no nothing is beyond you because you live under the rich mercy of God I want somebody to come in today and and understand forgiving people live beyond themselves if you've been forgiven if if God has seen your sins your transgression you're a mess and he is forgiving you then you're called to live beyond yourself Pastor I don't have the time to live beyond myself you are a product of the saving forgiving Grace of Jesus Christ you got time forgiving people live beyond themselves to date my question is are you choosing your preference or are you choosing to understand the only reason that you're here is bought by hey Glory the grace of God that's a moment right there it's but by the grace of God that you are alive it's but by the grace of God that you are here in another moment with another opportunity it's but by the grace of God that he has forgiven you and called you to follow him it is but by the grace of God that that situation did not rip you apart and tear you apart it's but by the grace of God so I made the decision that instead of living for me I'm gonna live for him I made the decision that because he loved me first so much I'll in return love those who are my neighbors those in whom he put around me because it's not because of me that I stand here today but it's because of his Rich Mercy his favor and his grace upon my life Galatians 2 and 20 says this I have been crucified with Christ and I myself no longer live but Christ lives in me and the real life somebody said the real life the real life I now have within this body is a result of my trusting in the Son of God who loved me and gave him self for me that's powerful you don't start living until you start giving the Bible lets us know in order to truly live you've got to give those who sacrifice their life would truly live I'm calling us today we're no longer keeping score we're no longer watching people to see when they're messed up we're no longer focusing on who's not going to be good and who's not going to be great we're making a decision right now that I'm living beyond my means I'm living beyond my preference I'm living beyond my understanding I'm living beyond what's in my pocket I'm living beyond my political views I'm living beyond what I think in my mind and I've surrendered myself to the will of God today you know what I believe I believe that God's calling to us to have a church a church that's so in tune and so focused in and so and and I mean we're just in God so much that it doesn't matter how much outside of our preference it is we are sold to him that says God whatever it is that you want to do my answer is yes it doesn't even matter anymore I'm not considering because of the way that you love me the way that you've forgiven me the way that you've given your life for me all my answer is is yes so Paul writes to the church in galatia he says I have been crucified with Christ and I myself no longer live but Christ lives in me my question today is what's living in you heart heart unforgiveness a sense of resolution or I have to have Redemption from other people a sense of a lording over people's mistakes my question today is what's living inside I'm saying today Christ live inside of me dwell inside of me teach me and show me your way so that can live according to your will
