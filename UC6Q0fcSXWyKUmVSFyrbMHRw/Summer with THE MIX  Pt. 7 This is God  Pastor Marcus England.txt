[Music] i think it's important that you understand i came with a purpose and i came with expectation and you should as well believing that god wants to do something while you're here today i have an expectation to believe that god is not going to leave me where i am he is going to take me from where i am to where i need to be so there's something about walking in with the level of expectation that says god i'm trusting you i'm believing you no matter what the situation feels like right now but there's something about a faith breeze a fake phrase says i don't see it right now but i believe that god you're going to work it out anybody need god just to work something out and you've got to faint praise right now i'll praise him when i don't feel like him i'll praise him when it doesn't look like it i've got to praise him i shall what enter into his gate with thanksgiving and to his courts with praise anybody got a praise in here stand on your feet and give god the praise that is due unto his name hey oh yeah [Applause] he's more than a savior to me he's lord i want to help you understand the difference when he is only savior he operates us the one that has brought you out of darkness and he has saved you and brought you into a space of eternal life but many christians get stuck at him being savior and not him being lord and lord means i begin to die to myself [Music] and i take on the understanding that who he is is greater than what i feel it's greater than what i think it's greater than the capacity of my understanding it's larger than what i can see within my own self i begin to understand he's lord and when i know he's lord it means i reverence him whether i feel like it or not when i'm in his presence i'm before him god whatever it is that you want to do we bow before you to acknowledge that you are lord you are savior and you are god just touch your neighbor real quick and say he's more than a savior to me he's more he's lord he's lord he's lord he's lord when i don't feel like he's lord when the weight is heavy he's lord in the days when i'm sad he's the lord when i'm crying uncontrollably he's the lord when the addiction wants to take over he's the lord in the middle of my depression he's the lord in the middle of my anxiety he's the lord when my bank account is empty he's the lord because he's always making a way when there seems to be no way [Music] when it seems that i'm at my last end when it seems i have no more strength left he's always making the way because a savior will only save you from the moment that you need them but the lord sticks with you no matter what the bible says he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me cause he's just tell your other neighbor real quick he's more than a savior [Music] he's lords and we're so grateful today [Music] as you're on your way down to uc just tell somebody it's good to see you come on tell your neighbor real quick it's good to see you welcome to the mix my name is marcus england the lead pastor here and i celebrate what god is doing i welcome each and every person that is online we are so grateful that you have joined us this morning and we believe that there is something that god wants to do we are in expectation of his greatness his power we're believing that as he is speaking he is operating we prayed for you this morning in those sections believing that if there's a broken marriage it'd be mended by the power of jesus christ if there is hurting and brokenness that it would be healed by the power of jesus christ that if there is depression that it will be overcome with the joy by the power and name of jesus christ that the anxiety that lays there that god will give you a spirit of peace as you sit in this moment we believe that there is something about the presence of god that can overcome anything that the enemy has sent to destroy and attack me and i believe today that you are in the right place at the right time so tell your third choice i'm glad you're here listen y'all next sunday is baptism sunday and i'm excited why am i excited because we have the opportunity as a church to be able to watch people as they have made an inward commitment to change their lives and made an inward commitment to allow jesus and now they are what uh they have this ability to be able to exclaim outwardly that hey i am a son or daughter of jesus christ and so baptisms are taking place you can sign up online on the mixed app you can also join us on sunday and as the lord is tugging at your heart i want to tell you this is the next step if you have given your life to jesus that you would be baptized in the name of jesus christ so we're excited about that and then listen i want to celebrate everybody in this place for helping us have an amazing serve day can you clap it up with the people that are around you come on come on come on yeah yeah yeah i want to let you know 63 volunteers 1440 waters were given out 90 bags were served to the ronald mcdonald house we served about five schools we painted we cleaned up y'all we started new curriculum no i'm just playing no we didn't go that far but we were helping out making a great time happen in these schools and i am so grateful for every person that was a part every individual that prayed and was a part of seeing these things happen we say thank you i just wanted to show you a quick highlight of what took place and i got a little special at the end to let you know what god not only did here in baltimore but what god did over across seas let's check this video out real quick [Music] come on y'all got y'all gotta give it up so as you can see we served here in baltimore maryland but what you may not have known or if you've seen on our instagram is that through our mixed groups during through during life together with other people we found ourselves at a place where we had a mixed group that was in togo africa and it was with a divine breakthrough church and they were so impacted by what was taking place in doing life together that they had uh over 34 volunteers to be a part this is the first church in togo africa in that community to serve that community and so they did an internet come on the mix y'all y'all international y'all need to be excited about what god is doing come on y'all asks what's up so we sent over shirts and we had an ambassador here from the mix uh our wonderful sister in christ laura lee and she went over and they impacted so much that people begin to join who had never joined before and they had commitments from people in that community that they wanted to come to a church that would make a difference in their community so i still believe that the local church is the hope of the world and i'm excited can we jump into the word of god absolutely come on y'all know what we do we pull out our notes because we know that note takers are what world changers and we're pulling on our word of god if you don't have your bible it'll be on the screen but we say that readers are what leaders so turn to judges chapter six judges chapter six we're going to read verses 11 through 17 11 through 17 judges chapter 6 and we're going to jump into the word of god starting at verse 11 it says this now the angel of the lord came and sat under the terebinth at ophra which belonged to joash the ebizarite while his son gideon was beating out the wheat in the wine press to hide it from the midian knights it says and the angel of the lord appeared to him and said to him the lord is with you o mighty man of valor it says and gideon said to him please my lord if the lord is with us why then has all this happened to us and where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of midian verse 14 says and the lord turned to him and said go in this might not of mines but he said of yours and save israel from the hand of midian do not i send you and he said to him please lord how can i save israel behold my clan is the weakest in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house and the lord said to him but i will be with you and you shall strike the midianites as one man and he said to him if now i have found favor in your eyes then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me i want to come from the title today this is god this is god can we pray father in the name of jesus we believe in this moment as we are here together and online we are believing in expectation that you your presence is upon us your presence is in this place and so we believe that as your word speaks life we're declaring over us that we are set free by the blood of your son jesus christ father today as we hear your word help us not to just be hearers but also doers of your word that we will be not only freed but transformed in jesus name somebody say amen amen listen i think this is important thank you so much musicians and y'all can y'all help me give it up for our dream team that's in the house come on y'all big ups to our dream team a big shout out to those of you that are taking step three today and we'll we'll be joining a team we're excited about that and that we're looking forward to connecting with you the scripture here lets us know that as we are overviewing this book of judges judges is a time before israel has a king and a kingdom we talked about two weeks ago that there is a kingdoms that we live in the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of heaven as followers of jesus christ we are what caught in the middle we are part of two kingdoms but this is the kingdom of the world and in judges there are men and women of god that the lord has set in place so that these judges are what deliverers for the seasons and the times that israel comes to find themselves in one of the things of israel's pattern which can often look like our pattern is that israel finds itself in a place of pride and israel finds itself in a place of thinking it has the answers and through its pride israel sins israel's sin brings a result that brings suffering usually there is a component that there is a group that the lord has that comes and takes over israel and brings them to a place of repentance and it says and every time that israel repents it says that he god has raised up a savior to be able to get them out of their storm jesus is always making a way i want to speak to you today to understand that for every problem god has a provision for every problem god has a provision what i want to let you know is no matter where you are no matter what you are going through no matter the space that you're in in life whatever you are facing there is a provision for your problem i need you to write that down in your notes there is a provision for my problem every provision does not mean that there is a total disappearance but here's what god can do god can be such a delivering god that while you're still in the state of what you in he can provide a way out of no way god can give you the ability to be able to endure what you're going through even though you may not be coming out like i i want to speak this because oftentimes we may have heard this verbage he may not come when you want him but what he's always what on time and god is always on time but it does not mean that everything that you pray and everything that you ask for comes into fruition into the way that you would like for it to come but here's what i know is that regardless of the way that god comes he's always a deliverer whether he's a deliverer that sustains whether he's a deliverer that provides a way out whether he is a deliverer that keeps you in the middle of the storm whether he's a deliverer like david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil whether he is the kind of god that keeps you in the valley or brings you out of the sauna he is a delivering god for there is provision for every problem i want to let you know that everything that is in your life that you feel is overwhelming for every piece of your life that you feel that you keep sinking to for the areas where you're dealing with the addictions of life and and you're feeling it's overcome me for all of my life i want to let you know that heaven has a provision for earth's problems and i'm telling you today it's not about the feelings always going away but it's about you being able to serve a god that in the middle of my feelings he's still yet faithful he's a faithful god he's a way-making god he's a delivering god he's a peace-giving god he's a joy restoring god he is a god that can do the impossible but we've got to know that wherever and however god chooses to deliver us he is still yet a deliverer and as israel is walking through this say understand that every component of their life they know that the lord is there and i don't know if you're like me but oftentimes in life i can get in my own way and get caught into my own feelings and get wrapped up in my own life because i don't like the way that things are going i don't like that my prayers have not been answered i don't like that the storms of life have not calmed down i don't like that things have not gone the way that i like i don't like that my bank account keeps telling me that there's no money even though i'm going to work can i get an amen right there i don't like it i don't like the feelings that that come with this place of what we talk about it's a place of process and in process god is working through my insecurities and in process god is working through my patience and in process god is working out my faith and in process i don't get to see everything i want to see when i want to see it but here's what i know he's still away making god [Applause] and in the state that god has us in here's what i want to let you know is that oftentimes you don't recognize why you were born in the season and time you were born in the bible lets us know in judges chapter six that the the the angel of the lord comes comes to to gideon and he and he says to gideon the lord is with you almighty man of valor here is where the contrast seems to be a little bit opposite is that gideon is is hiding in the wine press and and and he is is in the threshing floor with wheat and he's hiding from his captives who are the midianites who have come into this this area of israel and they're ramparting everything that israel has they're taking it over they're stealing from them they're wiping them clean and and they are fearful because the enemy when he comes in he comes in like a flood anybody know that to be true he just don't come in to mess up your day he comes in to destroy your life john 10 and 10 says the thief comes to steal and to kill and to destroy he is on a mission to break you out of your purpose and even when the enemy has worn you out so much that you find yourself hiding up in the basement when you find yourself put away in the cuff in the corner and you're saying lord if i can just say out the enemy's way maybe he'll leave me alone the lord has to remind you oh mighty man an almighty woman of valor the lord is with you you must understand of the lord of hosts the bible says the god of jacob he is what your refuge he is the place in when you go to there is a place that we go often times if you're from states and places where there are tornadoes they tell you to go down in the basement a place of what refuge and you stay there until it's over i want to let you know some of us have been hiding and guess what the storm is over and god is calling you to man up and a woman up and said oh mighty woman and man of valor the lord of hosts is with you he is the lord of hosts he is the one who is the god of jacob why is that an important scripture because it lets us know the lord of hosts is with the the god of jacob is our refuge jacob shouldn't even be alive according to abraham and sarah why because they were too old to produce a seed a seed that was on the inside before the beginning of earth but i want to let you know when god has established the problem when god has looked at the situation and he speaks provision over the problem i want to let you know today when you see jacob it's reminding you that what god is with us his promises are what yes sir and amen i can believe his word the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob what is my refuge it is the promise that god is with us it's not just a good scripture to quote it's a remembrance of the promises of god and i want to let you know regardless of how dry the seed feels the bible lets us know he can make water in desert places so i want to let you know today whatever you've been going through wherever you've been at in life i'm telling you today i'm speaking to the dry bones that are in your life and i'm saying dry bones get up he's a weight maker he's a problem solver he's a provision giver he can break the yoke he can bring it back he can keep you in your problems he's a waymaking god [Applause] he says let me remind you that you're a mighty man and a mighty woman of valor the lord is with you you may have been in your depression you may have been in your anxiety you may have been hiding because the world seems so rough but i want to remind you today that the lord is with you but the bible says the lord is with you wherever you go [Applause] when we are followers of jesus christ we understand that even in our messiest moments even in our most broken moments even when sin has repeated itself the bible says if you just call on the name of the lord [Applause] he will renew you know why renewing your strength is good because what the lord says is i'm not coming in to solve it what i need what you need to be able to solve it is already on the inside of you so i just need to give you the what the strength to be able to overcome as gideon is in the space where he's been defeated he looks at his situation and he goes back in he starts recalling his life [Music] if you're with us then why is this happening to us anybody ever been there before if you're with me then why am i going through if you're with me then why am i in this storm if you're with me and you said this to me then then then why do i feel this way if you're with me then why did you take that loved one if you're if you're the god who can deliver and bring free god then why am i going through this in my marriage if you're with me and i'm yours and you're you're you're loving me and you care for me why am i experiencing these problems he says you're the god who did it for israel to pass where are you if you're really with us can i say today that some of the reasons that we don't believe in the god of our parents is because we've heard the stories but we haven't experienced the movement let me tell you a little bit about your parents for those of you that had those church parents they while you think they were deprived and being ran down and and you got a little church here because you're sick of like the way the church was and we were there monday tuesday and oh my god we had to come back wednesday thursday here's something they understood is that the bible told them that if you hide that word in the heart that you don't sin against thee there is something about the lifeline and the word of god on the inside that can keep you in the middle of the storm so they understood that the more that the word of god was on the inside of them the more they could withstand the song the reason you're here today and the lord has kept you is the reason that you must understand the lord of hosts was with them the god of jacob was their refuge they understood it the question is do you [Music] because if you don't understand that the god of jacob is with you then you don't understand why you trust him in the middle of the storm you don't understand why you still serve him with tears coming down your eyes when you don't understand you've done everything that you could have done and it doesn't seem like the lord is on your side why would i still serve him because i have the faith to know that he is with me wherever i go it doesn't matter what it looks like the lord of hosts is with me that's why i'm with him because he's more than a savior he's lord so where the understanding comes through is that gideon is running back the bible here's the problem you get frustrated i get frustrated and we just walk away from it because we have no word to remind just like jesus did when he was being tempted by the devil you've got to go back to the word of god that establishes and sets the foundation for everything and you got to go back and say but you told me i was more than a conqueror and if your word is true then you've got to give me the strength to overcome but if i have no word i have no promise and if i have no promise i have no provision so i have nothing to stand on but what you say is church is not worth it church may not be worth it but god is because his word becomes established in my heart and his word becomes established in my life that through faith i can depend on him i'm not living this thing through sundays i'm living this thing through every day because i understand that even when it seems like the enemy is winning i am still who god says i am almighty man and woman of valor but when i have no word i have nothing to go back to and so your promise doesn't do enough to your spirit to encourage it to keep going because your affirmation is not good enough to speak to the spirit that's on the inside of you spirit can only encourage what spirit so i need a spirit that is stronger than the spirit that's trying to overcome me to be able to speak to that spirit and say not yet no no no no we're not going that way why because all god already declared a promise over my life he said it's what yes and amen and i'm believing it to be soul so i need a spirit that's greater than the spirit that's trying to overwhelm me and overtake me the bible lets us know to gideon says well this mighty man of valor what in the world is going on with my life why are we where we are why do we live in the house we live in why is our marriage the way that it is why am i experiencing this crisis in my life the lord says for every season of your life for every moment that you're experiencing here's what i got to let you know i've already raised up a deliverer [Applause] see we we don't walk through time to understand that those who have come before us were not brave people who had brave motives they were deliverers we didn't understand now when there were moments where conflict was hitting in the world and and you saw all these people come in that got this guction in this notion that i've got to do something about it they had already understood that the processing moment that they were in was they were already being set up to be a deliverer i just want to let you know today that god has put you in such a place that he has called you to be a deliverer and you don't even know it you was raised up in this day and this time you were born at the exact time you needed to be born so that the purpose and the seed that's inside of you could be fulfilled but the problem is is often times we get so wrapped up in our lives that we are looking for deliverer when god displaces the seed of deliverance on the inside of us we just forgot because our trials and tribulations have overcome us so well that we now feel like that we are what's subject to the problem and god says i've given you dominion over the problem i called you to speak [Applause] so i told you to speak to the mountain and say mount mountain be thou moved into the midst of the sea but you stop speaking because what the enemy has closed your mouth why has he closed your mouth because he's put enough enemy territory around you to make you forget who you are but i want to speak to somebody who reflected the other day who knows on the inside of them when they look recently and said this is not who i am god has made me greater god has put something on the inside of me that's more than i can imagine or even think i know that i can what do the impossible with god with me with man it's impossible with god all things are possible i've come to help deliver i've come to help set somebody free i just want to let you know the enemy thought his distractions was going to get you but i want to let you know the fact that you're sitting in that seat and that you're online means that he did not win i spoke to myself as david said and i said self get yourself together get your mind together get your thoughts together you got an agenda to make you've got a purpose to fulfill i'm not going out like this just tell your neighbor real quick i'm not going out like this y'all i feel like preaching the day i'm trying to tell you because god is doing something in this place somebody is hanging by a thread today and god said don't you let go i've got something in soul for you almighty man an almighty woman a valor the lord of hosts he's with us the god of jacob he's our refuge if i need to go and hide in him i'll hide in him but i won't give up i won't let go i won't throw in the towel because he's speaking to me he's with us let's tell your neighbor real quick he's with us i want to give this information to you because what i know is the enemy is really good at making us forget who he created us to be as we walk through scripture in judges chapter 6 we recognize that he turns to him he says go in this mind of yours some of you forgot you have the strength because something took the strength from you that addiction the stress the multiple surgeries the folk on the job the finances in the account it took the strength from you it wore you out and it brought you to a place [Music] where you said well i might as well just quit this is not turning out like i thought the people are not coming to my rescue like i thought the things aren't at the place i thought they were my my it's difficult my family is difficult i i'm just in a space i miss the loved ones and and i'm dealing with some problematic spaces and and i don't know how to deal with it it's hard can can anybody just be honest and say it's hard it's hard i might have the material things but [Music] it's not the material things that i don't have that's wearing me down it's the strength to keep on [Music] through disappointment the people leaving us through the time we gave and we thought it was going to work out and it didn't but can i still tell you that through all that you're going through this is god this is god moving in your life to remind you that you are not who the devil is trying to convince you that you are [Applause] i want to say this very clearly because oftentimes we will identify ourselves with the person we used to be the habits that still leak and roam around in us the hurts that we've experienced that were not our fault and the ones that were our fault and what he tries to do is mold us around our brokenness but the bible says that god understood how broken we are and understood how broken this world is that he says i'll just take it all and i'll work it out for good even in the middle of the hurt even in the middle of the praying and even in the middle of crying even in the middle of losing the home in the middle of walking away from what you thought was everything in the middle of the child being born not being born losing one one with with special needs you just didn't know it was going to go this way but he says i want to remind you that there's a seed inside of you and he says go in the might of yours i want to let you know today you have the strength to do this you're going after that that degree that you like i don't even know why i'm doing this i don't even know what i'm doing this is crazy i already got one what i need another one for and god is pushing you to be an educator because the purpose of the information you will share will change the lives of families and communities but the enemy is just speaking in your air you're not going to do it it's not going to go well it's going to break you it's going to put you in a place where you can't finish it you you're going to lose your family you're going to lose your sanity you're going to lose everything if you keep going down this road but he says it's in you can you just tell your neighbor it's in you it says seeing you i want to remind you it's in you and you're called to be a deliverer i want to let you know that martin luther king is not the only person god called to break bondage to bring freedom and equality he called you to make a difference in your family and in your community in the world that you you're part of but what the enemy tries to do is remind you of your past and even will convince you enough that you start believing the bible says that gideon said but you must don't know who i am you must don't know about who where i came from you know you must still know that my parents were on drugs you must don't know that i'm an orphan you must don't realize and understand that i was aborted you you know they just left me where i was you you don't understand i'm a foster kid you don't understand that i experienced being molested as young you don't understand that i've got a lot of baggage and damage and he began to go to me he said you don't understand who i am you don't know who you're talking to he said how can i save israel my clan is the weakest he was like we're the smallest group of manasses why would you call on me my my family name it's it's not even that it's not even that gnome no nobody know that name he says how can i save israel he said i'm the least of my father's house i'm the youngest i'm the one who ain't got all the degrees i'm the one that everybody doesn't look to as successful i want to let you know today that he's still calling you [Applause] and you may not believe it but he's calling you here's here's where i want to help you it's point number one i want to let you know that god identifies not you [Music] god identifies your purpose god identifies your identity god identifies who you are god speaks to it not your level of education not the way you enunciate not the way in which you have the ability to read god identifies you god has given you a special blueprint god has given you a fingerprint like no other fingerprint the bible lets us know it says that we are what fearfully and wonderfully what made [Applause] we are masterpieces made in christ jesus to do good works tell somebody beside you real quick you're a masterpiece here's what i want you to reply back i know because the problem is is you haven't spoken to yourself what god has spoken and you call it humility but you're really self-sabotaging who you truly are because it's easy to be like no no no not me no no that's not me you know no i don't i don't do it no you need to start claiming it and saying that thing straight up tell your neighbor again say neighbor you're a masterpiece and you reply back that's it [Music] i'm here to give you a whole bunch of extra i ain't here to self-deprecate i ain't here to push it down i'm here to tell you i am a masterpiece created in christ jesus to do good works i am who god says i am i am the head and not the tail i am above and not beneath i am blessed in my going out and my coming in i am generous i am god's handprint i am who he says i am yes i am not walking out of here talking some other stuff god says i'm delivered guess what i'm delivered did you think about it last night yes did you do it no why because i'm deliberate i'm calling those things out as though they already are because i know humility is not in beating yourself down humility is knowing 100 i am who god has created me to be i walk in dominion my mouth when it speaks it declares what the spirit of god speaks i put things into existence that god has already declared on heaven to be done on earth when i pray things happen when i pray people are healed when i pray deliberate happens why because i am a mighty man of valor don't you let nobody talk you out your destiny don't you let nobody talk you out their purpose because they have low sanders because they can't see it you say it i am who god says i am i have identified with god he already spoke it i don't need you to declare it i'm walking in that thing i am everything he says i am i will change baltimore i will deliver the captive i will see people set free [Applause] i'll get a side eye you give me so [Applause] see we get caught up in what other people think way too much you mad at me this sunday i don't care [Applause] i will not allow you to control where i am you don't read your words so your emotions control you god's word controls my emotions so i am leaning on what the foundation of the word of god pastor you arrogant you can call it what you want but when i get to the gate [Applause] i will hear a well done thy good and faithful servant i don't know what you're gonna hear but you take this journey with me you can hear it right behind mines [Applause] hey pastor you going in yeah i'm going in you come on right with me [Applause] because i've been living it out i wasn't concerned about what everybody thought i didn't allow my emotions to control where i'm at i didn't allow people to get into my head every time they got into their head y'all stop doing that you need to understand god has already declared the seed of who you are i want to let you know that promise that you feel churning on the inside that's god [Applause] i want to let you know the day god identifies you you can't get that from anybody else you can't get that from an enneagram you can't get that through a work study you can't get that through a disc assessment for all of you that love growth track you can't even get it from the spiritual gifts assessment it's going to help you but your identity is in christ your identity is not in what you have what you're wearing what you got on today what's in your bank account can i tell you you can still have joy and see that negative now a tear may come out james a strong one and it may be more than one or two but you can still like i've got the peace of god why because he's always making a way and it may look different now but in a few when you see me pull up with them fresh tags cause i've been taking the bus don't worry i'ma still give you a ride because he blessed me so that i could be a blessing this thing ain't about me y'all this thing is about fulfilling the plan that god has over our life so we must understand god has identified you not your spouse not your parents not anyone else around you god identifies you because sometimes you're going to rub wrong against the people who are closest to you because they can't see what god said and you don't have to be offensive you just got to be confident i get you i understand your concern but let me tell you what god said and i'm choosing to identify by what he spoke because why i cannot see it i truly believe that he is a god that has to come through on his word god identifies and so as god has identified you today romans 8 and 30 says this and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified declared free of the guilt of sin and those whom he justified he also what glorified raising them to heavenly dignity this ain't not earthly dignity just saying about what you think about me this is not about how you think i should be promoted this is a heavenly dignity i'm walking in a spiritual understanding that this is who god says i am so guess what my circumstances around me do not control the narrative of what heaven has already spoken i've declared it because god has spoken it and this is who i am point number two is that god identifies but god also speaks the lord speaks because he has a word to give and with relationship with god we hear god speak we hear the angel of the lord speaking to gideon the lord is with you sometimes there's a subtle moment where you're ready to give up and you hear something faint on the inside saying don't you give up you're almost there i want to let you know that is not a great person on youtube speaking that is the spirit of the lord when you are frustrated and ready to go back to what you used to be and what you used to do and you hear a faint voice saying just hold on a little bit longer that thing is on its way your healing is on its way your breakthrough is on its way i just want to let you know and speak into your life god still speaks [Applause] he's still speaking he's still declaring guess what he's not doing he's not creating why is that good to know because whenever you're going to god to ask him about what you need it's already done [Applause] he's not like oh i didn't know my bad real quick oh snap didn't see that he's done creating he's ready to speak somebody just say right now lord speak to me i gotta hear your voice i gotta know what you're saying i need to know the next direction this is pivotal at this stage in my life i can't afford to go back the other way i can't afford to make the wrong turn i need you to speak lord right now [Applause] but how do i hear the lord speak it means i've got to be one of his i've got to be a part of his i got to be connected in him through his holy spirit john chapter 10 verse 27 says this the sheep that are my own hear my voice and what listen to me we need all of that verse because it's important when you say he's my savior and lord [Applause] it goes beyond you saying it with your lips and declaring it with your actions so he says in repeat the sheep that are my own hear my voice and listen to me and it's that's right that's right you read that thing you declare that word son he said i know them and they what follow me not do their own thing not do it on sundays to check it off the list they follow me they follow me monday they follow me tuesday they follow me wednesday wednesday night when it gets rough they follow me thursday when things look hopeless they follow me [Music] because when they follow me i speak and point number three is god confirms can i tell you today that god wants to confirm what he said it's all right to be like lord i need some confirmation listen anybody of you anybody here you just made enough mistakes in your life that you like i can't afford to go down another wrong road anybody there i need you to what confirm it i need you to speak this i need you to let me know listen listen i need you to tell me through my cousin through my uncle i speak it through an unbeliever just like you spoke it through a donkey they don't even know what's happening i need you to confirm that thing in my life god you're telling me to go out you're telling me to empty the bank account on this one you're telling me to sow the seed i'm going to trust you i because you spoke it and you're confirming it i need you to what take this moment with me and tell me what it is you want me to do i can't afford to make no mistake this is the season where god is using you to deliver so you need god to do it somebody say right now i need a confirmation i need you to tell me this is it lord i'm gonna go sacrifice but i need you to stay right here i need in favor if i have favor with you then i need you to stay right here until i come back and offer sacrifice upon to you and when i offer it you'll let me know this is the way to go because i've got everything on the line and i can risk it for a good thought or a good idea you're messing with my purpose we're not talking about couple dollars we're not talking about a couple days you're messing with my purpose you're messing with my future you're messing with my legacy i need to know i need to know i need you to confirm your word i don't need you to call me out and i don't need nothing spectacular i just need you to confirm your word if it's through a devotional confirm your word if it's through a still small voice confirm your word if it's through a child confirm your word whatever it is i just need to know because what you said if i seek you i'll find you and if i found you that means you'll speak a word so speak a word the only way i know this is because i know the god of jacob how do i know the god of jacob because i'm in his word [Music] his word assures me who i am how he speaks and when it is yes and amen [Music] i want to tell you for the person that i need to prophesy to in this moment to the unbeliever who jumped on or is here today and said to myself i don't even know why i'm looking at this i want to let you know this is god this is god this is the reason you're here this is the reason you're in this moment this is god don't you compromise who you are don't you compromise your family [Music] don't you put your pride in the front to prove something to somebody don't you waste time with ideas because you don't have a vision [Applause] you say god i got gotta hear you i gotta hear you if you don't know where to go from here that's what you do this week god i gotta hear you i'm not making another move i'm not i'm just not sewing another seed till i hear you i gotta know what you're saying i kind of know where you have me to go i gotta know what you have me to do because here i'm not here throwing dice to casting lots i'm here because you speak and through your holy spirit those of us that are followers of jesus christ he said it if you seek me you will find me knock and the door will be open if you call upon me he says this i will i will answer [Music] i just want to speak a word of peace to someone today i want to let you know that weeping the hard moment the broken place the thing you don't understand right
