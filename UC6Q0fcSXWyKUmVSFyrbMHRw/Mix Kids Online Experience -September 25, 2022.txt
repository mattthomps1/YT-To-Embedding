[Music] thank you [Music] foreign good morning World Changers happy Sunday hi amishi and this is mixed kids do you remember who we are that's right we are a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world we are happy to bring you all fun and exciting ways to know God our hope is that you would share God's love with your family and your friends do we have any World Changers watching for the very first time or even visiting today for the very first time we say welcome we are so happy that you decided to join us today this month our theme is back to school back to Faith we are going to talk about some simple topics that will remind us about having faith in God while getting into the routine of going back to school who remembers some of the things that we talked about from the last two weeks that's right facing fear and God looking at our heart this week we are going to talk about God's masterful plan and we are a part of God's plan did you know that God has a plan for you specifically for you last week we talked about God looking at our hearts and not judging people based on what they look like on the outside this week we want to focus on how God made each of us in his own image each of us is God's Masterpiece and he is the perfect artist a masterpiece is a one-of-a-kind piece of art we often hear about a famous piece of art which is considered a masterpiece this masterpiece can be found in a museum in Paris do you know what the name of the Masterpiece is that's right the Mona Lisa the Mona Lisa is a beautiful Masterpiece but not as beautiful as the Masterpiece that God creates when God creates a masterpiece he considers much more than just how it looks his Masterpiece are put together to fulfill an exciting purpose chosen by him for him even when we are at school we have something that God has given us to do can you think of some things that God may have chosen for you to do at school I'm thinking about being a new friend to a student who's at school for the very first time or what about a classmate who is struggling in a hard subject or even being a team player on a sports team imagine what a job it would be to create everything on this Earth piece by piece from every grain of sand to every leaf on every tree how big of a job would that be imagine how God worked to create the Earth and imagine how he worked on each of us every one of us are God's creation that means that he made every part of you your smile the color of your eyes and even the way that you walk everything that you see and know about is a part of God's creation well I have this container this jar with some sand in it and I'm wondering if I can count the grains of sand what do you think do you think I can count the same grain by grain absolutely not there are too many grains of sand imagine how many grains of sand are on each Beach more than we can imagine just think God created every single grain of sand just as he created every one of us there are times we wish we were a little different maybe in the way that we look or the way that our personalities are but God has a special plan for each of us remember we are each made in God's image for a specific purpose yes we are all different but just like we talked about on last week even though God made us in his own image what we look like on the outside is not that important there may even be some things that we wish that we could change about ourselves like wishing that we were taller or shorter or maybe if we had longer hair or shorter hair but God made us for a specific purpose and even the things that we do not like about ourselves is what makes us who we are and we're able to do what God has chosen for us to do we are God's Masterpiece now help me with this week's memory verse which comes from Ephesians 2 and 10 and it says let's say it together for we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do and that can be found and where that's right Ephesians 2 and 10. before we go let's sing and dance to every move I make with CJ and Friends [Applause] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
