lord to move i need the lord to operate i need god to do something on today i am so glad that you're here welcome to the mix my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i am so grateful to

special to speak in this place just come on smile at somebody around them tell you somebody around you just tell them real quick it is good to see you today god does all things perfect even when we don't understand he operates and moves in his perfection and so today i'm going to talk about the church and its impact a little bit as we continue in our series of week 3 of i think i believe i think i believe we're going to grab our bibles our bibles are important they're impactful they consist with the testimonies they consist with the history of understanding why we come to serve this god while we come to believe in this one named jesus who is resurrected from the dead and the bible says he wasn't just resurrected [Music] but he our savior rose with all power in his hand and so we're going to talk a little bit through the writings of matthew one of the disciples of jesus he gives us a recount that's what we have which is the gospel this good news is going to tell us a little bit about our understanding of what god is doing in the church today and if you get out your notepads it is an opportunity for you to be able to grow here we say notetakers or what world changers so you are a world changer we want you to pull out that note something that god has for you today and something i believe is going to impact your life today matthew chapter 16. we're going to be starting at verse 13. i'm going to read all the way up to verse 19 and it says this now when jesus came into the district of caesarea philippi it says he asked his disciples who do people say that the son of man is [Music] it says then they said some say john the baptist that was a little weird [Music] john was the one who baptized him but according to them it could be john the baptist others say elijah which is a prophet of the old testament or prophet of the old scriptures jewish scriptures others jeremiah or one of the prophets [Music] i think that's important to understand because when you're not sure of who jesus is you're not sure of what jesus can do i want to say that one more time when you're not sure of who jesus is you're not sure of what jesus can do and when you're not sure of what someone can do you only trust them to the limit of your understanding [Music] but he said to them the disciples that were with him but who do you say that i am simon peter always being the spokesman for the group speaks up and says you are the christ that's not the last name of jesus he's saying you are the messiah the one who is to come the one who is to save israel the son of not the dead but the living god and jesus answered him blessed are you simon barjona it's like jesus calling out your middle name you know you know how when people really know you they call you by your middle name they call you out there you never call them this throughout any other parts of scripture but it says blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you he says this but my father who is in heaven and he declares a statement about the church that will be for everlasting in the minds and understanding of people this is what he says he says and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church i want to help you real quick understand the reason he says my church because there are other churches the word church in context of greek is under the word ecclesia and the word ecclesia is a word used by rome of the gathering of those in the legislative branch of government he had to say it's my church because he understood there were multiple churches with multiple assemblies but what he wanted to say is i'm not talking about anything else you know as a church he says i want to talk about my church with my identity with my spirit with my thumbprint my church he says i will build and he says and i want to let you know no matter what people say out of their mouth no matter what people try to do to it he says and the gates of hell shall not cannot will not prevail against it and he said this to them verse 19 he says i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you lose on earth shall be loosed in heaven can someone say amen to the reading of god's word i want to come from the title this morning the unlocked church the unlocked church can we pray father i pray this morning that we become the unlocked church that you have called for us to be in this season in this day and in this time for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen the unlocked church the unlocked church why pastor do you think it's so important to talk about the church because i believe that as we are getting an understanding to the revelation of why the church is important in this day and age we are upon a time where the idea for most is to see themselves at a place in life where they we like to go after and live out life in the most comfortable way possible most of us are trying to find the the best way to live comfortably the best way to operate comfortably and if we want to be honest with it is that we are always at a place in life where we're seeing new inventions happen anybody ever been there before people aren't inventing anything new they're just making what's already invented better easier you used to have to go to a car dealership in order to buy a car now you can go online and buy a car without ever looking at it return it back in 30 days if you don't like it i don't know if you understand that is a different level of convenience you no longer have to deal with people that if you know about a car dealership and if you are a car salesman we love you but we hate you when we're buying a car is that it takes 55 hours for you to run my credit takes another 90 hours for you to be able to come back and tell me what it is takes another 45 days for you to be able to let me know that i got the car and it takes another 20 days on top of that for me to walk through the paperwork in the process i rather just go get a bike a scooter a motorcycle something that just takes less time in order for me to be able to buy because the idea behind it is that things tend to take longer than they should well i think as we are entering to a place in life where we're learning that we're trying to be better at everything that we do i don't know if you're there but now we have locks that if you put your thumbprint on the lock now you can open your door without even needing a key anymore i don't know if you know about that i don't know if you know that you can literally find yourself typing in a code and you can open your home door and if you want people to come in you give them your code and if you don't you don't even have to change your locks anymore all you do is just create a new coat and say guess what you don't live here anymore this is no longer your residence you've got to find somewhere new to go back in the day you had to do what you had to find somebody to get a key to change it out come in redo the key but then you were scared they made a key copy of the key that you had you just petrified all around we found ourselves in a place [Music] where i thought about back in the day when i was a child and i'll never forget uh my mom she was the choir director for the choir and back in the day if if you know about it choir rehearsal used to be sometimes after church i don't know if y'all know about that but we would have church and have choir rehearsal right after it and and what would happen is the church would be open and and and people would come in for quad rehearsal it was a big old choir and as a child i would run around the church and find all the types of things to get into and be all around and it was just exciting you just got to be in there but one day someone walked into the church and they walked into the church and they went upstairs and they stole something precious to us my grandfather who was the senior pastor of the church when it first began he had a trombone and and the trombone sat in the library of the church because the church had a library because i think people checked books out i don't know i don't i wasn't allowed in there but there was a trumpet on and it had a plaque on it i said ernest gilliam senior and here's what i know that trombone was up there as a memorial i don't think the trombone was up there because my grandfather was good at playing the trombone i think it was just up there to remember that he used to play the trombone and we like things to have a remembrance and so they put it up there and someone came into the church they didn't harm anybody but they stole the trump bone now i don't know what kind of person in the world walks into a church to steal one of the most complicated instruments to play in the world but they come in and they steal the trombone and immediate relief from that sister paul that day they tell us we're locking down the church every time we have a rehearsal we're locking down the church every time somebody wants to come to choir rehearsal we're locking down the church and if you want to come in you got to knock on the door church change and it became locked and the access to the church was not as easy as it used to be i think about that in context to the way the church is now where the church has found itself locked up so much that what we see from it isn't an easy access to get into the presence of god where we're requiring people to do a whole lot to enter into his presence and it's almost like what jesus went through is null and void because what he did was took out the responsibility of us going through the process of the tabernacle where we had to in order to get into the presence of god you had to offer a sacrifice and in order to offer that sacrifice you had to give it over to a priest and a priest would take it and burn it and walk through a process to take it into the most holies of holies and it made the access to god only for certain people but jesus came who is the great high priest who broke all of the barriers for us to walk through the process of sacrificing an animal which did not have the ability to cover the sins of the world it only had the ability to cover the sins for a time here's what i want to let you know is now we find ourselves at a place where now jesus has come to bring freedom and i want to let you know the bible says we can go boldly before the throne of grace to obtain help in the time of need jesus broke down the walls in order that i could get directly to him today so now the church is accessible [Music] because the high priest is no longer behind the wall the high priest now lives on the inside of me thank god for the holy ghost i can take a praise break right there because what it tells me is is that i have access even when i can't get in touch with pastor even when i can't get in touch with the leader even when i can't get in touch with somebody who seems like they know god i can go on my knees before him and ask him and say father i need you right now in this moment in my life i need you to do something and the bible says he shows up right on time aren't you grateful that you have access to the high priest because we can go before him we can ask of him and he can move in our lives like never before but what has happened is is that oftentimes that we have made the church so much about us and it being the means to all ends is that we put a lock back on the church and people come to the church knocking looking for hope in jesus but there's nobody there to answer the door i think this is important for us to understand because we stop believing in the power of the church and we start believing that the church is an event to be a part of on sundays when the church is the very thing that god established and put together so that we could be able to grow in the understanding of who he is and who he's called us to be the bible says we are being prepared for the work of ministry here's what i want to get past you the work of ministry is not just about the work of ministry that happens in the local church it's about the work of ministry that god has anointed you to do to go out into the world and into the marketplace to make an impact on the lives of people he has given you a commission to go into the world and make changes to a world that's broken and out of fellowship if you don't understand the purpose of the church then you look at the church as a place and an event to attend on a sunday but the problem is is the church is the lifeline in order for me to understand the new nature of my kingdom access to what god has given me when i don't understand the bible then i see it as a sunday morning worship experience that i attend and that i get out by brunch so that i can get some good food later on when i see it as his church the ecclesia the assembly place where we are to grow and manifest an understanding of what god's kingdom is to look like on earth that's why when we pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done where on earth as in what is in heaven god is trying to do something on earth that he's already declared done in heaven and he's trying to do it through his church but a church that is locked up in its perspective and idea of what it's supposed to do can never be a church that's powerful enough to impact the world that it goes back into because it only sees itself as a one day event that doesn't have the power to change anything outside of when it meets here's where the problem lies is that we haven't unlocked the true potential of the church in the world we've unlocked the potential of the church in the building that's why when we say oh we had church is when there's been a move in the building but the problem is is the move in the building never moves outside the building and never makes the impact in the home at the workplace in our finances in our relationships and in the way we grow so the potential of the church only magnifies itself in the way that it performs out on that one day and once the day concludes we no longer believe in the power of the ecclesia because we don't understand that the church is not a building it is what the bible calls a body just somebody stick with me real quick if you understand that the church is a body then you understand the power that happens when the body is what together there is something about the impact of what the church has the ability to do as a together unit but when we relegate it to a day when we relegate it to an experience on a sunday we negate the opportunity to be able to take the church back with me on sunday and monday and tuesday and wednesday and i settle for the church being the church in the building but not the church being the church when i get to work [Applause] and so the church stays being powerful for the time that it's in action but not the time that it gets outside of its building and we've declared that we are the church only when we're in the church if the church was what it contained in the building jesus would have never declared that my church shall always stand and there's nothing that shall inhibit it he was not talking about a building because a building can be destroyed can i tell you a sunday service can be stopped with one power outage in the neighborhood so if the church cannot be destroyed cannot be stopped then the church can't be what happens on sunday the church can't be the movement when we start shouting a little bit yeah i come from a pentecostal background so if you start the click track i can show you a little bit of something how to stay on b but if that's the context of the church when that move gets into the cubicle it'll never change your soul [Applause] because it's not about what you do with your feet and it's not about how much you fall out it's about the power that's inside of you and if you don't contain the power of the holy spirit being active in your life nobody cares about what you do on the stage they care about what happens off the stage [Applause] one of the broken parts about being in the church is that you can hide in an assembly but the thing about being outside the church is that it starts to show who you really are see see life happens outside an event anybody ever been to a concert before and you just loved it it was your favorite artist you got there and i mean you had the best time of your life you cried you swayed you screamed you passed out they got you back up you cried again on the way home you listened to the whole record all over again i mean you had a time you kept the passes the tickets you kept everything you cried again when you looked at the pictures and video on your phone you were just are struck but guess what as soon as you hit your door back home you recognize what nothing changed can it be like that sometimes with church is that we have such a way in having church and doing church and operating in church that we're really good in it we're really good driving from it but when life really hits you and the bible says after you have suffered a little while you don't have anything to stand on because nothing has changed in your life you may have shouted you may have cried you might have passed out but deliverance is still evaded your life and the issue that happens with that is that oftentimes we lose the feeling which means we lose the presence that goes against the principles that god has established for he says i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you so that has to mean when the feelings have dried all up and i have listened to every worship song that i can to get through the moments that i'm in that he says when the cd is over when everything seems broken when everybody has dismissed you and when you are staying by yourself he says my presence is still right there and available to you when nobody else hears you when nobody else is talking to you he says i'll never leave you i'm still right here doesn't matter where people go does it matter what people do i'm still right here because i am god all by myself i'm omnipotent i am omniscient i understand i am here and there everywhere why because i am dogs that's the difference between a sunday experience and the presence of the living god it gives me the ability to be able to rely on something other than myself because i'm not reliable but it gives me a holy spirit that the bible says forms itself as a comforter what does it comfort it comforts me when i am in my anxiety of life it comforts me in my anxious moments it comforts me when tears are rolling down my eyes and i have nothing left to work with it comforts me when i have no understanding of why god with the direction he went it comforts me when i have nothing but the enemy trying to talk me out of my purpose and declare to me that something is wrong with me it puts me in perspective on wednesday when the sermon is over when the worship songs have run out when i have nobody else to look to the bible says i can look to the heels from where which cometh my help it says my help comes from the lord you know why he said the maker of heaven and earth he wanted to make sure that in any moment when you felt like god wasn't near he just wanted to remind you he is a creator he is the creator of everything around you so when you feel like all is lost and you feel like you have no motivation and inspiration he says i want you to look to the heels where it would come of your health your help comes from who the lord what kind of lord is he he is the maker of heaven and earth everything that you see and everything that you cannot see he is the god over it it doesn't matter what's taking place he says just breathe in a breath and he'll remind you i'm that god that kept you in the midnight hour i'm that god that woke you up in the morning i'm that god that gave you breath again to breathe i'm that god that's giving you a mind to stay still even when you want to lose it i am that god [Applause] says that's who i am [Applause] that's what happens on thursday afternoon [Music] when you don't feel his presence he says i must still remind you that i am the maker of heaven and earth so anytime you forget that you're spinning in what i created that you're standing in the very thing that i am holding up i want to remind you i am he well what happens is that we forget it because we don't understand the responsibility that we have to be closely knitted to him through his church and because we have seen church as an event we separate ourselves on sunday from what is his church and we try to defeat the battles of life on our own in our broken and limited state instead of reaching out for that in which he called to be joint together the clarity that i want you to get today is that you need the church you need it more than when you show up on sunday you need the church more than when you attend for that service you need the church because the church is the place in which ambassadors of god's kingdom have taken the responsibility of giving you the clarity about what it is to be a citizen of the kingdom of heaven and if you don't know your rights and if you don't understand your position then you will give up the blessings that god has declared for you because while you are a citizen you are a citizen who doesn't know their rights and if you don't know your rights you don't know what to ask for the bible tells us that we can come before him that we can come directly to him that we can seek him in the midnight hour that we can ask of him when all things are broken apart that we can seek after his will and after his face but i don't know that and so what i do is i call my friend on the late night hour who cannot help me who is slumbering off of their own worries and their own disagreements and their own brokenness and spaces and i'm trying to get a concealed understanding from them but he says you're supposed to call on me because you've called on me he says i'll answer if you seek me you'll find me if you knock the door shall open but if i don't understand it then i'm always negating the process of what he wants to do in my life that when my marriage is not the way that i want it to be i can call on him in a small whisper and the bible says he knows the words that i cannot even utter he understands my heart when tears are running down my eyes when i am uneasy in the way that i feel the bible says he knows he knows my groanings he knows what you can't describe he understands what floods your heart but cannot be described in words he's that kind of god [Applause] but when we don't understand it [Music] we go to groups and we go to people to get the clarity on what god is saying for our life when they don't understand the clarity that they're saying in their own life because the clarity isn't there when disobedience rise over top of what god is saying the bible says an only way to know the mind of god is through the holy spirit and only access to the holy spirit is by being obedient to what the holy spirit is saying and speaking in your life therefore you cannot know the mind of god without the spirit of god and you cannot know the spirit of god without being yielded to god [Applause] so today it's hard to try to go after people for advice when they don't know the mind of god to tell you about your life that comes from him which we learned last week week through psalms 139 it's a creator who put us together and knit us together in our mother's womb we're going to people who are broken and who are empty to find our direction when god says i uniquely created you and crafted you in such a way that in the way that i created you nobody has the identity and print even as close as your mother even as close as your father even as close as your husband or your wife or your best friend i'm here today to let you know nobody knows what god has established on the inside of you but god but if you don't learn through the church the clarity and understanding that god's scriptures are letting us know today that we were made in the image and the likeness of god and that we were created for a purpose what we do is walk around in a sense of lostness because what we're trying to identify by is everyone else's opinion and perspective and we have failed too many times to go back to that place again [Music] first point i want to give you is that we need to unlock the church and allow the church to have access the church has access to the power the church has access to the things that god has already declared god has said i will work through my church he is not working through government he is not working through your politicians he is working through the church there is no authority that has the ability to hear what god is saying but the church of the lord jesus christ that group gives the clarity and understanding to know that if there is no church there is no one to be able to translate what god is saying to his people i want you to understand that if the church is absent from the world the world is absent from god [Music] because the church speaks to that which is of god we are ambassadors to his will to his way to his plans to his ideas to what he has for us the church has access to things that you don't understand at times that are not accessed by yourself the church has access and keys to some things that you will never understand if you go back in scripture that we read in matthew chapter 16 it says in verse 19 as he's talking to the church he says i will give you the key somebody say the keys keys keys keys it says of the kingdom of heaven and it says and whatever somebody say whatever says whatever you bind on earth no we're not going there no that's not going to be the addiction in my household no that will not be what my marriage looks like nope that's not where my children are going nope that's not what we're doing here today nope this is what i'm declaring over my house my home and my people no this is what the bible says you don't know that as the ecclesia in a simile where two or three are gathered together touching and agreeing there you will be in the midst what we don't understand is that in unity there is power [Applause] the church has access the scripture says in mark 16 and 15 he said to them go somebody say go go into the whole world not half the world not pieces of the world go into the whole world and proclaim the good news to every what creature i don't care what they look like i don't care where they're from i don't care what back alley they're in i don't care if they speak english don't speak english i don't care if you can understand them don't understand them he said your responsibility is to go into the world and tell somebody about the goodness of who god is to tell somebody that i serve the resurrected king let somebody know that i have a message that can free you from the penalty of sin and to give you your life back what you don't understand as the church is that what's in your mouth is the freedom for the world in bondage he said go into the world and tell everybody every creature don't matter where yet no matter what's happening tell them the good news of who jesus is go and proclaim the good news why the good news changes lives the good news puts people on track the good news lets people know there's hope the good news keeps you from being up and down so much that you got to buy your way into happiness that you got to promote your way into a good life that the only way that you can understand what's going to be great in your life is by what you have and who you got and how long they stay with you because the way folk looking these days it's a tad shaky what he's saying is is what god has placed inside of you is a gospel that is so strong that it can set the captives free it can open the eyes of the blind it can do it but when you think it might be able to you relegate it to a day and a certain amount of hours and if you're really really new to church you start asking how long how long how long y'all be in church to the presence falls down how how long is that so like an hour hour 15. like just trying to figure out how long this presents going to take because i'm really like i'm not being no seriously like i got to prepare for tomorrow you ever seen people that have to prepare for tomorrow before tomorrow the day before tomorrow and you you're like how long does it take for you to to on a pair of pants really i need to know like how long are you preparing for to you y'all i mean that's not even church y'all had people in your lives be like we're preparing for tomorrow no i know your life it's not that structure no you don't [Music] no you don't like you you know like you're not fooling me i seen your child they got wrinkled clothes on every day [Applause] bastard don't do that i'm gonna do that now what's going on i got you know i got to prepare prepare you wear a uniform what you need to do arnold what are you doing i think our context is we're trying to get as much as possible for as less as we can god i want freedom and deliverance in my family but listen i only got 15 minutes so i need you to break these generational curses in the next 15 minutes or my reservation is going to get jacked up for brunch [Music] we've been here presence of god is moving lord is here so how long are you going to be you think i don't know girl just keep looking at the clock in the back we're trying to break something [Music] that has a hundred years on it we're trying to break things we're trying to break financial strongholds that we learn as soon as you make it spend it but we're not willing to walk through the process we're trying to learn how to have healthy relationships without giving everything up the front and having nothing at the end we're trying to work out how to have healthy marriages but we've never seen healthy marriages so we figure it out on our own and he's saying you've got access to the word you've got access to the very plan that's needed so that you can live out the best life possible but the way in which you're going to live it is you're going to try it out from what you know even though what you know is already broken and you're trying to work it out yourself the problem is is you won't learn enough to grow enough to do enough and it's not until we get to the end somebody say the end broke strung out mistakes angry pastor can you um can you um can you give us some counsel no no probably not why because you haven't even walked through your own counsel of being in god's presence because everything else around you is so much more important than your own healing so you're looking for what a fast way for god to deliver change and set free instead of walking through the process of what he needs to do in your life and establishing the groundwork to say god do a work in me so that what you do in me can be a testimony to somebody else [Applause] point number two is the church operates in somebody say collective power the church operates in collective power we are stronger together somebody say together then we are apart you keep fighting that same thing over and over yet you have not come to the understanding that god is trying to do a great thing inside of you let me tell you this the reason that we become bored with life is because we have no vision to excite us i've never found people that um i was trying to think about i was going to say that y'all but i think i am just going to go ahead and say it i'm going to tell you one minute i'm gonna tell you real quick one of the reasons why you're so bored because you've run out of your own vision and you don't have anything else to give and let me tell you why your family is stale and still where it's at i do know after these messages people people do unfollow me but i am okay with that i've come into that clarity and understanding let me help you real quick the more vision you have the more excitement you have the more excitement you have usually the more anxiety you have the more anxiety you have the more faith you need but when you have no vision you have nowhere to go so you have nothing to worry about because all you're doing is maintaining the same thing you're already doing and the crazy thing about life is is that we'll set our own parameters of how far we can get based on what we've seen within ourself the problem that happens in that is that god has so much greater in store for you and so much more that's waiting on you that you believe that you can only collect enough so that's why you always go for the first thing you see if it just barely measures up i'ma tell you we are in a huge huge world right now that doesn't say no to anything that has taken too long to become a yes what do you mean that means if you've been out of a job there is no way that you deny someone giving you a job because you never had a vision for what kind of job god has for you you'll take whatever comes isn't that a good thing pastor it's a good thing when you don't know where you're going it's a bad thing when you know where you're going because it means you see you don't know the word settling if there's nothing that you had a goal to get to [Music] you only settle when you haven't come to meet a mark there's no mark without a purpose there's no purpose without god so without god it means you don't have direction so it means whatever you're trying to set the standard for you'll go after that just enough to get where you are the reason now why you want to fall into comfort at 30. i'm ready to chill you haven't done anything [Applause] 30 you just getting out of park oh okay okay i got it now i got it i'm in it i got it now you're just getting out of gear tell me i've been worried you've been working you've been hovering from job to job you've been trying to figure out who can pay you the most you've been trying to figure out where you can land that you don't get fired but real vision and purpose nah that's not what you're doing because that will actually take faith and faith means you will pass up something for something you don't see but because i walk in the security of what man tells me i get good and comfortable instead of saying god what are you telling me so that i know where to go so that i don't end up on the same road doing the same thing in the same way and then pausing saying what in the world have i been doing you just been repeating the same thing in different environments [Applause] in jesus name ephesians chapter 4 says this says for because of him the whole body the church and all his various parts closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied when each part somebody say each part with power adapted to its need is working properly somebody say properly the question you want to ask your neighbor real quick are you working properly you're working but are you working properly because we can get those two things mixed up just because you're out there busy doesn't mean you're working properly just because you're out there and your schedule is full don't mean you're working properly just because you got things to do and people want to do it with you it doesn't mean you're working properly it just means you can be busy with the wrong agenda it says it's working properly in all its functions what does that mean that means i probably have more than one function and gifting that god has placed inside of me but because i am too lazy i settle for the thing that will be easiest yet bring the most return [Applause] i wasn't talking to danny he was just it was a friend of mine that i could i could relate to i can't stir too many people in the face like that it says in all its functions it says it grows to full somebody say full full maturity some of us are still babies and we've been going to church for years every temptation still falling every place of anger still succumbing to it everything that's not like god still wanting off of it every addiction still given to it he's like no no no you should be working in all your functions you should be moving and operating properly you should grow to full maturity and should be building yourself in what and you just is angry because you're distraught about the path that you've chosen that isn't meeting the needs of your life because it's not what you were created for and you're just angry i hate this job i hate i can't stand that you said yes you filled out the application if you think there's something more then seek him diligently and you'll find him and when you find him he'll give you clarity about what to do and where to go but you hating everything because you hate your own path and let me tell you why because you're horrible at giving yourself directions when you don't know where you're going [Applause] i think i should make it right girl you think i should make it right i shouldn't we should make it right it looks like let's make it right let's make a right that joint's sitting right up there up the hill where's that right there because somebody comes along who's been the path before but because you're not connected to the church you keep taking your own way and there's somebody right here that's like oh no i've been here before it's right there but you have nobody around you to help you get to that path because you're trying to work the path out yourself the last point is the church is not isolated this whole idea that we are isolated group of people that i'm just here to get get to grow closer to god just me and god like i just love god and it's just me and god and jesus was like yeah yeah yeah i want you to love me all your heart all your soul your mind he was like but you know what i really want you to do i want you to love those that around you as yourself wait a minute [Music] anybody know you real good [Music] at that vertical relationship but that horizontal with people when jesus added that second commandment which really biblically if you ask scholars is not a second commandment it's actually in line with the first it was just broken as if too it's like love the lord god with everything and love your neighbor and love your neighbor as yourself i loved you jesus i love you lord thank you jesus god i love you what about what about veronica over there she gets on my nerves every sunday i cannot stand her i don't like her i can't take her [Music] jesus like wait wait wait how can you say you love god in whom you've not seen but you you can't you can't love me [Applause] y'all we can love we can love some jesus but when they come to some people yeah come on y'all know it when they come he's like i'ma tell you it's like you want to know the true true test of discipleship you know how tyranny gonna identify that you're his he said it's about love you have for one another wait what do you mean oh no your discipleship is not included in how anointed you are how prophetic you are how gifted you are how amazing you are how well you preach how good you are when it comes to whatever gift that god has given you he says you know how people will be able to tell your discipleship is by the love you have for one another [Music] let me tell you why that's so crazy let's be like yeah just love people that's easy problem is is we're so introverted in our society we don't even like to try to talk to people so love who you know why we can be like loving people is easy because you don't talk to nobody it's that come on be honest oh this is i can do this it was easy love your neighbor as yourself simple that's my girl right there love her love all day every day what about johnny who's johnny johnny sits beside you every service oh that's johnny i don't know johnny like that now everybody got covered right that's how we saw oh no you know i don't do that i won't get too close let's go of it no the fact of the matter is that he knew as a society would be more likely to be selfish than selfless he knew it you would start thinking about yourself more you start thinking about how much more you can do how much more you could have how much more would be beneficial for you how much more you could take it and you would start to forget about the impact of being together instead of the impact of being solo by yourself and that's why the church starts to get destroyed because the idea is is how much can i take and watch out for me then the responsibility of me watching out for my brother whom i'm called to love and the problem with loving my brother is that it means that they're going to be good times and bads and he's trying to teach you what it is to be responsible for each other and not to do what you just want to do [Music] john 3 16 says what god so loved the world that he gave he moved past israel [Music] he moved past those that were just his and it said god so loved the world that he gave his one and only he said now you want to be my disciple this is exactly what i need for you to do give of yourself to people you don't know and people you do know we're like wait a minute and that's what the church forces you to do it forces you to be in communion with other people that don't always benefit you and when you live a life that is about the benefit of yourself you will receive from that seed the same thing what you get is what you've given you give nothing you get nothing he's trying to teach you kingdom way kingdom way is not about you anymore kingdom way is all about him i think we got to unlock the church again i think we got to start loving people in a way and being so generous in a way that we've never seen before and opening ourselves up and it's not about just being happy people it's about actually loving well here is my last part that the lord just put inside me this is what the bible lets us know we think about love from a very filial and a very aeroslove the erotic and that which is the friendship god says i'm calling for a godly love which means the way in which we love one another even if you're dating someone or you're married to someone that is a part of the body of christ it says you would not treat them that way because the way you love them you love them as god's daughter and son so you would not violate the blessings that are over their life for your own benefit that's how much you love the way you love is outside of your own fleshly desires of what you want for one another the way that you would love is in such a way that says i honor you as god's son and as god's daughter and the way in which i live out that to you is through understanding that's what you want from my life that's the way we love we love through an agape love not a arrow slug not through the erotic senses that we cannot keep under control for the bible says the fruit of the spirit love joy peace kindness gentleness but it says it's also self-control [Music] discipleship is not about how you feel it's about being obedient to what he says that's how we grow but people stop coming to church because it makes them actually have to surrender themselves to the lordship of the father [Music] today [Music] i think we're called in this season to understand the church isn't isolated acts chapter 2 verse 46 through 47 says this day after day somebody say day after day [Music] that's how we know the church started off pentecostal day after day they met together in the temple they broke bread together in different homes and shared their food happily and freely while praising god everyone liked them [Music] they told me not to say this but i'ma say it it's a possibility and nobody likes you because you haven't opened yourself up to be light [Music] the bible says those who are truly want friendship show themselves what to be what friendly it says this kind of church that was working towards togetherness that was working towards love that was working towards unity it says everyone liked them and each day the lord added to their group others who were being saved let me put my stamp right here your group is the same group for years because nobody is growing and no one wants to come in because you don't have anything to offer but your gift [Music] if somebody was entering into your friendship they would be changing and the bible says they would be saved [Music] i want to challenge you real quick have you made any new friends lately [Music] what that got to do with the pastor here's what i'm asking real quick because my question to you is is have you created such an environment that those around you want to be a part of you and that the world that sees you desires what you have [Music] because you've been called to make a difference and change the world i believe today we are called to unlock the church
