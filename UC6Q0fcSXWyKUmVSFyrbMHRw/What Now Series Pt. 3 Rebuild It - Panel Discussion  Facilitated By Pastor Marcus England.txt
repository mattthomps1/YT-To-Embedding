[Music] good morning everybody how y'all feeling come on how y'all feeling this morning y'all doing good well welcome to the mix uh my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here and i'm excited about today because we have an opportunity uh to be a part of what we believe is something special um it is black history month and we're so grateful for it but what we do believe is that every day is a part of our history that is inclusive of black people and so we're not regulating it to one month but we are highlighting it this month to be able to have an opportunity to see that god has created greatness in each and every one of us how many of you agree with that there's greatness inside of you come on now and so i'm excited um to be able to do something special today in our what now series as we're looking to talk about what things look like now and things have changed since the pandemic things are looking different our world is looking different but the bible says something really great is that while things are changing god is still yet the same and so it says he is the same yesterday today and forever more and we're glad that god is in this moment an opportunity with us to talk about not just about what used to be but about where we are today and where things are moving forward to and i'm excited to be a part of an amazing conversation today with some amazing people and i i wanted to give a perspective on it today come on now you know we can't do this without god and so i want to give you some basis some groundwork for how we're looking at today and what god is doing in us through us and for us and i believe that god has called for us to make a difference can you just find a person around you real quick and just tell them you're here to make a difference can you find a second person and say you're here to make a difference can you find your third choice and say even though you're my third choice you're here to make a difference come on come on you're here to make a difference and i really believe that there's something special on the inside of us maybe somebody hasn't told you that this meeting maybe someone hasn't shared that with you today but you are here to make a difference god still has you on this earth god still has a plan for your life and god is still using you to make an impact and difference in the world today and so we're here to talk about that we're here to talk about it in the most positive light because we don't just want to stay where we are we want to be where god has called for us to be and so i thought about this has got placed on my heart and we're going to talk today again with some amazing people i thought about the story of nehemiah and uh here at the mix you know i'm interested in making sure that we don't just get information but we apply the information that we have into our daily lives for the bible says faith without works is dead and so we just don't want to believe we want to be active in our belief and so if you could take out your notebooks your pens your paper your bible real quick um you're gonna get some jesus all the time always so uh pull it out real quick uh here we say no takers or what come on we're world changers in nehemiah chapter one it's letting us know that israel has just come out of babylonian exile means they were in a place where they were under captivity and those in whom have survived have moved back into jerusalem and and and there is a special place in their heart but the problem is is that the jerusalem that they left is not the one that they came back to and the bible says nehemiah is a cup bearer to the king artaxerxes and it says as he's talking with some friends that have come back they start giving him an update about where the kingdom is where the place that he comes from and when he starts to hear the condition of his community the condition of his city the bible says he begins to mourn and they tell him the walls of jerusalem have been broken down and it says and the gates have been burned and the people are in disgrace and the bible says it hits nehemiah so hard that he begins to mourn the place and where he comes from the bible says but he just doesn't stay there tell somebody real quick don't stay there it says he doesn't stay there buddy he gets himself to a place where something inside of him says i'm feeling something so i've got to do something if i can tell you this today don't rest where you are don't rest in the situation you are if you're feeling something then ask god how can i do something and it says and nehemiah gets before the king and that's where we're going to pick up in nehemiah chapter 2 starting at verse 1 and it says this in the month of nisan it says in the 20th year of king artaxerxes it says when the wine was before him i took up the wine and gave it to the king no i had not been sad in his presence and the king said to me why is your face sad seeing you are not sick this is nothing but sadness of the heart i don't know if you've been like me but anybody ever watched the news before and immediately you just felt like you got sad anybody have been there before you you just watched the clip and it's talking about all the horrific things that are happening nothing good is happening in the earth you ever gone on instagram and every feed every piece of what you're getting is about how broken and messed up the world is and you look at it and just it makes you sad immediately it makes you depressed it makes you just want to shut it off this is the place that he was in he was in a sadness in his heart and he says it it's nothing but sadness of the heart and the amount says then i was i was very much afraid he said but i said to the king let the king live forever why should not my face be sad when the city the place of my father's graves lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire can i tell you today you should be sad when you see the world around you collapsing you see the brokenness of what is being described we should be sad but we just can't stay in a place of sadness we've got to do something about it it said then the king said to me what are you requesting i'ma tell you something real quick the next time you look at the news the next time you're looking at something that brings discouragement that brings disappointment that brings discontentment in you don't just stay in the emotion but ask god what can i do about it it says what are you requesting he says so i prayed to the god of heaven and i said to the king if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight that you send me to judah to the city of my father's graves and this is where we're getting our topic of today's discussions that i may rebuild it can i can i share something with you god didn't call you to complain god didn't call you to grumble god didn't call you to just be mad at the state of the world god called you to rebuild it i want you to say this today i'm a builder i'm a builder god's called me to be a builder god hasn't called me to be someone that looks at it and shakes their head at it but god has called me to be a builder today and so we're titling this rebuilding what is god calling you to rebuild rebuild your family to rebuild your community to rebuild your nation what has god called you to rebuild not to just complain about but to rebuild something greater than what it was before today i believe that we are a room of world changers and i believe in being a room of world changes god's called us to make a difference and build that world back over again and i'm excited because i've got some people with me today that aren't just thinking about it they aren't just kind of like having conversation about it they are in the midst of it making a difference and i am excited to be able to have this amazing group of panelists before us today as we talk about how to rebuild it will y'all help me celebrate those that are

with you doctor good morning my name is dr yatunde reeves i'm the principal at paul lawrence dunbar high school come on yeah good morning my name is sharmika lewis i'm a licensed clinical social worker and a phd student at morgan state university come on good morning mix family my name is dana lewis i'm a licensed certified social worker dash clinical and i'm the ceo and co-founder of whole life center that i run alongside my wife which is a urban group mental health practice awesome awesome good morning family my name is christian lasseter i work as an assistant federal public defender in the district of maryland charged with all types of criminals federal courts and mostly in baltimore and some agreements baltimore's johnny cochran baltimore's johnny calkari let's give it up good morning everybody my name is michael brown i am the proud principal of winters mill high school located in westminster maryland lean on me was based off of him just want to let you know it's just life story i'm here to talk today because i think this is a amazing opportunity for us to talk about um just what's happening in our world um and we are not post pandemic we are in the pandemic but we're believing god that we will be in post pandemic somebody say soon lord jesus we will not get back to normal we will get back to the new state that we're in and the new place that we're in and i'm saying that because whatever things felt like they were before i want to let you know that we've moved from there and we're in a new place of establishing new problems answering new uh situations and topics speaking to new issues that have arrived and and we also have some new accomplishments that have happened in this time frame and so we want to dive right into it we want to dig into it we want to have a good time um and just have a moment to be able to connect in and and so i i want to come from an education standpoint i've got my principals here and they uh they are uh making an impact with our young people and one of the first questions that i wanted to hit was is what has been the quality of education for our youth since the start of the pandemic what's some of your concerns what are some of the positive effects like what's happening in our educational system that our church needs to know about and we need to be considering now right so um from the beginning of the pandemic uh you guys know it wasn't something that you know it literally happened overnight wasn't something that anybody was prepared for uh the students weren't prepared for it the parents weren't prepared for it we had to make a lot of adjustments technology was thrust into the lap of everyone students had to learn a different way teachers had to learn how to teach a different way and administrators had to learn to work with both simultaneously and so it created some learning gaps from students that did better um you know virtually but on the majority students did struggle you had students that we used to make straight a's that really struggle in that virtual environment and it just led to some learning gaps there's nothing like getting that in-person instruction for students and when that gap is there um it takes a while for it to come back and so for us we've seen those gaps who try to do different things summer school after school care after school programs those things have worked somewhat but on the whole it's going to take years from this pandemic for our students to get back to where they were so it's just understanding and being patient along with the process and understanding that there is no quick fix to where our students are whether it's emotionally or academically it's going to take a period of time and we have to be committed to that work moving forward awesome i would say that the gap widened if you're in an urban area or if you have a student urban school we talk a lot about the achievement gap it's been wide since the beginning now it's even whiter i'm at a school where most of my students are coming in they read we're not talking about kids who are non-readers but kids weren't socialized or educationized to be independent learners and so when you think about it from k to 9 10 11 kids were used to the teacher providing a lot of direct hands-on support i can raise my hand my teachers there i can you know go around the classroom resource and now that support is gone and so i think what it did for a lot of students was create a place of frustration um because now kids have to think more independently and they have to be focused because the inputs are coming in at a different speed in some cases we had to pivot from kids not having any homework right that's a lot of culture in high school don't have any homework on your homework well now everything is homework because now you actually have to practice um and so i think that it made it really really difficult to really determine who's struggling because now you have cameras off you know kids are in their bedrooms you don't know what's happening on the other end of that computer screen and teachers are just teaching and so that way of knowing oh you look confused let me re-teach that that's obsolete i also feel like it was an opportunity i went from a school where we had computers for attendance purposes for entering grades but not being used for instruction and so i felt like it was an opportunity that we seized and that at dunbar you know the dunbar we had to figure out how to use zoom and google classroom and uh paradex and nearpod and we found through research and lots of youtubing lots of educational platforms that actually have made learning more interactive and i believe more productive so i would say it was twofold obviously kids struggle like my my colleague says that you had kids that went from being successful to kids who were struggling but now schools had to be accountable differently because if kids aren't logging in i can't just accept that 20 of my students were missing so now as the leader i have an opportunity and i was home in my living room i could have said well 80 online is good we're just going right with the 80. that 20 missing was gonna come back this year and be even more behind and so it was an opportunity also to think about how we're engaging families how we're engaging the kids that we know are struggling how do we equip teachers with now a different responsibility for engaging parents differently um so it's been a mixed blessing but i also feel like it's created a space to catch up with the 21st century in terms of how learning is delivered also i think that uh parents in here don't have any parents in here of children that are still in school i got some parents great great great great did you notice how large your gap was when they started bringing homework um home and you didn't know what you were doing anybody know about that you thought you knew how to add until they told you differently and you're like yeah you just carry it over and they're like no we're grouping you like grouping i don't know what this is so it is really been an adjustment on both ends trying to figure out how to make this difference how to make this impact and um you're saying so many things that are connecting which is that we are having to bring in the gap that we didn't know even existed i can even tell you that with church we're learning how many people were really being discipled and how many people weren't really being discipled how many people were shouting on sunday and then they were the enemy was really getting at him in the week and so i think it is been able to produce a bigger view of where have the gaps been all over just emotionally mentally what's happening in our system what's happening educationally where are the gaps and i know we're going to talk to this further more but it's made us confront our responsibility for the gaps that we do have because now we're seeing these moments of i have to learn it i have to figure it out i have to get a little bit more personal with people where i could just read you at first and know you know what i mean and now i when the screen is off i got to check myself because i be you know you feel disrespected when somebody screen off you know how you feel you start sending them threats you know what i mean like i'll fail everybody in here these screens don't come on and uh um and and adults don't laugh too much because if your job did that some of you would be let go right now just the way that you look in your bed the way that you have not even washed i'm not even gonna go there right now but i think that we are understanding this um i heard a preacher say we have to learn this is the season of being able to pivot and having teams and groups of people who have the ability to pivot is really important to us actually getting ahead and not staying where we were because people will talk about well this is what we did back then and you're like but that's not what we're doing now and so my my question and as we're coming in we're talking about this education and we're talking about this level of of of change that's happened one of the things that we oftentimes see is that there's always something bad according to the news baltimore is bad everyone is dying everyone you're not even alive right now everyone according to the news is dying there is nothing great everyone should be in jail everyone should be uh penalized and it's not the right perspective we're just learning all of the answers that we think we have as being professionals sitting in our seat in front of the tv or in front of the computer is not just where it ends and so i wanted uh from just literally a critical point christian as you're talking about it and you're seeing it how has the pandemic and what we're seeing in the gaps that have been noticed how are they impacting what's happening in our judicial system what's happening in our jails what you have to deal with how is that changed and even different more than it was before i i think whenever there's you know hard more difficult times it has a definite impact on the judicial system right on crimes and arrests they go up let's just be clear the pandemic has strained every aspect of society whether it's education educating so many of my clients don't graduate high school and you know after the fact they're now they've been arrested and my work is so reactive and that's one of the frustrations i have is that you know so when the educational system is strained and when i one thing i was thinking about in the beginning of the pandemic is i can always look and a lot of what i'm doing is is mitigating sentencing right my clients when you're charged federally usually that's probably the end of the road it's a strong case and you're facing a lot of time that's usually how it goes so what i'm trying to explain to certain actors being a prosecutor or a judge is how could we even get here and i have to learn my client's life in depth at times um and usually you can pinpoint a few things or my clients are teetering on the edge and this is in events or factor whether death of a friend or a death of a loved one or so forth or they move to another area or they drop out of school something happens where now they've now taken a different trajectory in life and they end up as my client and you know what what i'll see is and i always wondered it was in this pandemic how many of these kids now that are going virtual because it was hard because like like was just said by um you know dr reeves and mr brown dr brown should say is is there are serious serious implications right educationally speaking right and it's hard and it was overnight right overnight all of a sudden now we're all in our homes and figuring this out something that we don't have any comparison for over 100 years right and the world wasn't the same then so it's not there's no this is the first time we're dealing with this how many of these kids that are going virtually and myself having two kids and having to teach them and be an attorney at the same time from my basement which was crazy is how many of these kids are going to come back to school is this the the the event in their life that pushes them towards these factors where they were already at risk of being my client at some point so i think there's that i think there's mental health component everyone's mental health is messed up everybody's right everyone's dealing with a lot of battles day in and day out myself included from this pandemic we've become you know normal it's been normalized to have this amount of death happen right there's thousands of people that die from covert 19 every single day we don't even think about that's normal and i remember in the beginning thinking wow 50 something people died today oh wow that's a lot and then all of a sudden it's a hundred and a thousand then it's a thousand every day then it's two thousand we just don't even almost a million people have died now in this country and you know just that type of strain and the normalization of all these traumas that go on um you know mental health systems being strained and overworked healthcare systems being overworked and health care workers right and all of this has an adverse impact on on people and communities and unfortunately that directly results with people having adverse reactions to stimulus right if you're on top of one another in a small home there's a fight that occurs right and if your mental health isn't great your your response is going to be worse it just is and when those events happen because mental health has a direct correlation with what i do a lot of my clients have mental health issues that haven't been addressed or that we diagnosed at the time now you're facing life in prison and all of a sudden lo and behold we find out that you have autism and you didn't know your whole life and you're 35 years old now i literally had that happen in the case recently right and having to explain that to my our expert figured out this and he's like oh my goodness light went on that's what all these issues were for me my entire life right and just thinking about that stuff and and all of those the impact of it and then also hopelessness sets in right my clients that are in jail right now their cases are being adjourned and spaced out and you can't you don't know if you'll have court or no no we can't it's not safe for us to be involved it's not safe for him in jail either right what are we supposed to do with this is people just sit there on top of each other so it's a lot of that that exacerbates things we're all on edge and when you're on edge and when you're not thinking about things and when you think things are hopeless you have certain impacts and reactions and those reactions unfortunately cause certain incidents that then you know end up and result with them being charged to be my client so like there's it's a really really really you know there's a lot going on right now at the same time and we're in a very fragile place and that's i think a direct correlation what goes on during the pandemic right now anyway a lot of the stuff that we're talking about here and i'm also seeing it even though i'm not you know representing clients in that sense i'm seeing an increase in students who have been charged with violent crimes during the pandemic and i believe that you know if you weren't engaged if you were having a negative experience log into zoom every day and you decided to just be checked out then how are you feeling that time and so we have several students who committed serious crimes that were released quickly and they're waiting to be adjudicated and so now the school is trying to play this you know we know your sentencing is coming because it's pretty clear what happened and we're trying to make sure school is still this really safe space and now you have kids who are immediately triggered because they're in this level of high sensitivity at all times and so it's it's crazy how much our worlds collide even though you're going to education not thinking you're ever going to interface with a criminal justice system we're almost like colleagues in a sense because of what we're dealing with in public education definitely cousins put it that way i think we work with a lot of um adults and so in talking about gaps during the pandemic we've seen a lot of identity gaps um who am i now do i want this marriage now can i take care of these children now um a lot of like what do i want to do next right a lot of us are making decisions in this part of the pandemic am i going to continue to work this job um and so people are having to make a lot more decisions a lot more quickly and so there's this identity gap that brings on more anxiety more stress and more fear about what's next and just to add on to that i heard you guys say strain and as a clinician being in the pandemic and working through it with clients it's been a lot of strain on us as therapists right especially as african-american therapists because it's only about what 3.8 percent of us in the field that provides mental health services for our brothers and sisters so it was a lot of strain on us and it made us see like wow it's a real gap out here for black male and female clinicians and it's like we can't take on everybody right well i wish i could but i tried to send everybody to y'all i definitely did some of y'all no i'm just playing but yeah so thank you on that but um yeah that was the gap like it really showed us that wow like we really need um more black male and black female clinicians in the field to provide services and there's also a resource gap because i'm in a school where some of my students don't qualify for certain level immediate services and so if you have a parent that's working with insurance my school-based therapist may not be able to actually support you beyond just an initial conversation and so it's it's kind of uncomfortable when you know there's an issue that then say well mom dad what kind of insurance do you have and then i have to make sure that i'm doing that with a level of sensitivity but this case could be a crisis and so the school-based therapists have been stretched thin because if you're out of school with 1.5 social workers like we had at dunbar last year and you discover 200 kids that are in crisis those social workers are the front line because i'm not a therapist i can listen and talk and triage but i'm going to punt you to the person actually can provide more care and so that level of support in schools has been stretched incredibly thin that was already under resourced to begin with i think you got um students hispanic students are hispanic population a lot of black population even some of our white students um you know utilizing this pandemic to to work so they've gone out into the community they're working right so they've been able to uh handle both so they're online zoom whatever and now they're able to work so they might be able to work 40 hours a week they're bringing that that money home sending it back home to their home countries and everything's great now when you got to force them back into the building now you got to sit down you got to be in school uh it creates a problem for them because they're not able to be there because they got used to that money the parents got used to that money so now you can't go back to what you were making before because now you become dependent on that money how many you know you get a new job you're like lord please give me a new job so i can you know just make it you get the new job and then you start looking at your bills and getting like man i need another new job guy because you you start to spend to the means that you that you start making so and some of those kids who are working have shifted their goals ninth and tenth grade they were four-year college bound now they're i'm not going to college i'm just going to work and so the conversation then becomes well let's look at it from a lifestyle you know you're working part-time but you have on jordan's and you have on under armour like how much is this outfit so let's talk about if this amazon job no shade is going to allow you to live the lifestyle that you're accustomed to now with your parental support and so not judging people who have to work because there's a legitimate need but some of my kids are working because they just want the latest and greatest whatever and now it's shifted their goals they also know that maybe college will be virtual and they don't want that experience to continue forward so it's been this really difficult time to talk about post-secondary plans and what does your future look like and where are you going to be in 10 years and now we're having to navigate the reality also they've been working and so now come back to a school where you're like don't do this don't do that do this they're like wait a minute i'm grown you know and so having to now have them be back as students has been a major shift in school as well and just to add on to what you were saying like when i was working with youth at the beginning of the pandemic because their parents lost their jobs a lot of kids felt like they were supposed to be the bread winner at this point so it was a lot of stress and anxiety on them to feel like hey i'm the man or the woman of this home let me step in i don't got time for school i need to really provide for my family because of the things that were going on in society with their parents losing their jobs and just a lot of things were just spotlighted so the child felt like they had to really step into the position to hold the fourth down at their home which has impacted their mental health anxiety depression um giving up on their goals giving up on their dreams and really helping them even as a therapist to help them to see like hey man you know you can still focus on your dreams and goals you know this is just a season that we're in and that we will overcome this that's really good that's really good and you know we're talking about that mental health space christian said it i'm gonna say it clear he just said we all crazy that's what he said um as we continue said straight up is we all are dealing with some mental health issues and and the and the serious part about it is is we think that our new level of high intensity living and social uh adaptiveness of seeing us move and go and and jump on a virtual call i don't know if you've had a day like i've had but my day starts almost at around 6 a.m and it won't end and i'm talking about zoom calls because now it's almost like you don't have a reason not to be in the meeting anybody know your work increased it was just it was before like i want to go back it wasn't this much work now it's like you've got a meeting at 10 12 3 4 6 and you're just trying to find out where i'm eating on my meetings now i talk to people i don't care i'm going to eat either other than that i'll pass out in the middle of this zoom call because it's like well now that you have this availability we're going to expand it and the responsibilities haven't changed and so in life that we're talking about and i just want to make this clear is that it has impacted how we are dealing with life mentally and how we are dealing with where things are going and what is happening and um some of us know we're reacting a little bit a little bit more edgy aren't we you know somebody's saying something you're a little bit more quick and you're a little bit more edgy somebody looks at you the wrong way you're a little bit more edgy with it somebody is walking down the street you're feeling a certain way and we're just living at this high level of anxiety or tension and some of us don't even know what to call it we are just dealing with the day-by-day pieces of what is brought to us can y'all talk a little bit about what the last two years have just done mentally to us as adults and young people and how we can kind of move and recognize how to move forward with where we are so um the bible says that we are fearfully and wonderfully made and aversion says complexly and one of the things that we all have is a central nervous system right we all have this response system that is created for us to be able to move and interact with our environments and um you're not we're not made to be in sustained crisis right we're made to react to crisis to bring ourselves to safety and to move on and live peacefully and then another crisis but what has happened with the pandemic is that we have lived in a sense of sustained crisis and when that happens all kinds of things are happening in our minds and in our bodies right there are stress hormones being released there are things happening in our brain and our bodies and what happens is that it really causes inflammation in our bodies and out and in our brains right it causes our nervous system our immune systems to sort of break down and deteriorate um it causes our executive functioning our ability to make decisions our ability to remember so if you are around your house and you can't find your keys and you've never been a person that loses everything it might be that you know your stress response system is being overworked and so other things are breaking down and like pastor marcus said we are in this state of hyper vigilance when we are in a state of hyper vigilance we're talking about cortisol and adrenaline being released we're talking about us always being on edge us overreacting us having high anxiety and so even though we've tried to because we are adaptive in our nature we have been able to still go to work still teach the babies in the basement while being an attorney still doing those things your body and your brain are doing a whole different response than sometimes what we see in our external um interactions and so that's why you get the overreaction that's why you get the forgetfulness or you're more tired um than you typically are sometimes that zoom call that you're like oh i can do a zoom call that thing take you out you'll be like wait i'm so tired well i'm so tired you know it's because we are one o'clock naps anybody know about that one o'clock nap they're about to come on again absolutely but that's why it's happening it's because our brain and our body are constantly being worked because we're in a state of crisis and because and because we've been in a state of crisis one of the positive things that we can take a look at because we've been in crisis is that people are now more invested in their wellness they understand that we cannot put this on the back burner we cannot just suppress it we can't just pray it away we actually need to go to the professionals that god has put on the earth to to tap in and to get that healing that we need so even though it's a crisis on the crisis side of things it's always a solution and that's the resilience right and that's the solution to the problem is being able to understand that i can invest in my wellness that i don't have to be in this state of crisis i don't have to uh move around and suppress it like no i can actually go get the services that i need and now that things are telemental health it's more accessible right so you don't got to worry about if you got to catch the bus gather up some money catch the bus get to the office or you got to drop the kids off to get to a session or do whatever you need to do is is very accessible and you can do it right at the um at the comfort of your own home i thought you were about to get your uh give out your name and number and email right after that that's what it felt like you were about to do a a commercial so the idea is is that we just really aren't called to do life alone and we need help in doing life because a lot of the weight that we're taking on ourselves um if you're even married you're expecting your spouse to be able to handle the state of the pressure that you're under and you're operating as if it's still the same level of pressure or the same level of uh stress that you had before and everybody knows our stress is up i don't even know um and i'm watching dr reese um as she is when she came into dunbar i can speak to this um because you're an influence to me i just want to let you know that um she came in and then the pandemic hits and now she has to get all of these new resources to be able to operate that i haven't even never seen before so i was on my three calls with her and we were on all kinds of stuff that i didn't even know existed we was on google classroom we was on another i was like i didn't even know where did you find this and the work that had to go into bringing people up just to a basic speed was incredible it was huge it was it was massive the on taking and guess what your load didn't change and i would offer i think people forget that while many professions are still working from home educators are not so we went back into the school when there was still a live an active super active pandemic and so hearing people say like oh i'm still working in my basement i'm like yeah that ended a while ago and i think the work of educators has quadrupled because you guys are talking about crisis well people often call the principal the teacher first and we're saying well we're the first we're the first line and so if you know an educator if there's one in your family this is where you also extend that person grace because they're having to navigate their own families and then let's say you're a t-drive teacher with 200 kids my ninth grade has 200 students that's 200 families that call that's 200 kids to see if they're in school and so that level of stress and responsibility and then fear because there's still a pandemic right you're still going into a situation that could lead you to you know contract covet yourself so that fear as well is bubbling out there so it's been really traumatic and stressful to be leading while you're supporting kids families parents neighborhood issues have not changed they've actually gotten worse and there's not enough conversation about now that people are in these stressors how does that affect schools because the neighborhood comes into the school more often than not and so i just wanted to lift that there's a lot happening that doesn't often get mentioned in the context of education because we're thinking only about can kids read and write and that's not exactly the full breadth of what it means to educate young people and i think those uh those stressors um are going to manifest themselves over the next couple of years to be catastrophic for education so you know teachers educators everybody that's in the field of education are over it like they're over it like to the point where i think a recent poll uh the national association for secondary school principals came out with a poll things like 40 of principals uh are rethinking whether they want to continue to do this profession or not it's 40 there's over uh 10 superintendents that are now leaving their jobs to go you know do something else amazon and probably so whatever whatever is not education um and some people have retired and you know i know a colleague of mine have retired you know working that hardware store you know i was just like this is the best job i've ever had because you don't have to like think or worry about anything just tell me where the hardware stuff is and i'm good to go but like that is where people really are at and is really taking a toll on people throughout this entire pandemic just being able to do their everyday jobs we kind of you know forget about i found more about my staff than i ever really wanted to know just different health issues that that were going on with them their home life situations um the whole nine yards there's been marriages that's been broken up through this whole situation that has been a leader in the building you have to try to figure that stuff out and help them through it i am not a healthcare professional you know i do not have a medical degree however i could probably sit now and probably take some type of nursing uh tests and probably pass it because of all the things that i've learned over this pandemic things that have changed on the health care side and what we've had to do as educators has been tremendous so it's just a lot contact tracing and talk about that part of it finding out who has what i i don't know anything about that you know what i mean but you had to learn you better learn about it real quick if you want to keep your job and do that calling people at 10 11 o'clock at night just let them know that their child may have covert or their close contact these are things that educators have had to do and teachers that is not in their wheelhouse is not what they went to school for and i just want to lift this up it's feeling a little sad i don't want to i don't want to turn anyone away from the profession but but i also think it's been a place i've been a principal for 16 years and this is also an opportunity to find new joy because what brought me joy to three years ago is not the same experience now and so i do feel like while there are people leaving the profession it's also given me a chance to decide like i'm actually recommitting to some of the work because it looks different and i've learned so much that i didn't know and i have a doctor i've gone to school i've you know lots of education behind me but i feel like we also get to model for young people what does it look like to be a lifelong learner what does it look like to show up to say you know i don't even know how we're going to solve this problem but let's do some research together or let's partner with families in different way like let's actually reimagine and rebuild schools differently because it was never meant to actually support black and brown kids to begin with so now we have a chance to actually do things differently because it's pressure they're pandemic no one has the answer which creates opportunity thank you for not quitting but i was going to say i i think also just to acknowledge i think um you know principal brown spoke to this just a moment ago is that all the people that are so educators or first responders or pastors or social workers right are all people yeah right that are dealing with their own things right at the same time and have these other issues that are coming from their own personal lives they have to bring into it and you don't think i joked with you before pastor about this like you always expect your pastor's always going to be in a good mood yeah no no pastor is a human being too right or your teacher is a human being and understanding that that is has a direct impact on things as well and how this dynamic happens and the pandemic is really hard for everybody i think that's really something i've learned about and tried to work through this pandemic is like making sure that i take time and something that charmander said before was you know having this like zero down i think i can't remember the term he said the power down excuse me power down where like you take the crisis and the stress of life and put it to the side for a moment and that's something that i've tried to do and i think that's a great technique for everybody because we need that right and that's something that impacts everybody you said something earlier that struck you said there are people living in situations where they're living on top of each other and i think that sometimes we have to remember our own privilege because i wasn't living on top of people i could spread out i have plenty of spaces to clock in and zoom in and zoom out and i think sometimes we get into a situation of it's actually selfish to think oh my god my life is so horrible i'm dealing with this well there's somebody that actually is dealing with a more challenging more dire circumstance that we also have to have empathy for and i think even leading a building i've had to remind my staff like while we may be frustrated imagine our parents who are now our co-teachers who didn't have the educational tools that we have to support their young person so i do feel like it's also perspective and also that moment to just be grateful that while i hated not traveling i still had a chance when the world opened up to hop on a flight and not everybody has that privilege and opportunity we want to be mindful of that too as we're navigating this new normal that's real good that's real good i i wanted to jump into the idea we've talked about the pandemic we've talked about the impact educationally we're talking about it mentally what we're also talking about that happen during this time seem to be an uprising in racial tension in our nation and as a church we always want to talk about how we are dealing with what is well known the racial tension the the the issues that come about and that aren't just black and white um we saw uh that there was the discrimination against asians and we've just seen that it's picked up on all levels and and so i want to talk about that because um as a church of a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world it's very easy to try to choose your preference over your purpose and it's real easy to get into a comfort place where people like me people only in my space people that think like i think that's the people i want to do life with but um we're dealing with some issues that have come up and i said this earlier which is i don't think they're new i just think they're more publicized i think we're capturing them on camera more than we used to i think that we're seeing it in if you're living a life where everything is perfect on your end and you're good you're not living in reality and you're missing the real impact of what's happening in the world and so i want to bring all of us together because christian you said something in the first experience which is it's not just a black and white problem it's all of us problem and so we've seen two major cases i feel and we've seen others come into effect and we've had the george floyd and mod aubry and we're like okay cool we feel like you know there's justice has happened and we've taken two cases and we've spread out the thought process that everybody is in the same place and maybe we're getting better and i feel in some areas that we are but personally um we have to go back and see really what has happened over these last two years that's heightened and then also what's the impact racially that it's had on our city our nation and just us personally and i love the panel to literally talk about what that looks like so i want to jump in on this um with the george floyd situation like when we saw that on the news it was like what you were saying pastor marcus like we thought we had a reprieve of um police injustice and things of that nature police brutality and then when we saw it it's like our hearts dropped again we got frustrated again we got more anxious again so when you think about the racial injustice that has been going on in america it has heightened our um our senses in a way that makes us feel unsafe because i know for me on a personal note you know when i'm riding down the street and police officer come behind me i'm like did i do something i'm i'm just taking my son to school but i feel like because of what i saw because of the ahmad aubry cases and the george floyd cases it just puts me on high alert and i think that in this time that we're living in i think it's very important for us to acknowledge these feelings place a name to these feelings don't suppress how you feel about what you saw and what you feel about the racial climate that we're in and also know that you can make a change it's about making that personal decision to say you know what i'm not going to let the hate of racism influence my heart to the point where i don't see myself making a change in the world i i think too all of us all of us want to escape can always be honest because of the high intensity we want to escape we want to escape to somewhere where it doesn't exist we want to escape to a place where we're okay um it's even easier to escape back to people like us so i don't have to deal with detention so let me find an all-black church let me find an all-white church let me find a place that easily fits my set of circumstances because if i'm already dealing with detention all around me why walk into another space place school that i've got to deal with it and i'm even saying that to you mike because you're you're not just in an urban school where everyone looks like you or we're in these urban spaces it's like i am going to make the time to do something that i don't have to do and place myself in position to see real change take place and to be a part of something different um i'm just thinking about how do we really find ourselves in a place where we can see real change happening what are some things you're doing in this racial climate that's helping you to be able to deal with it but not only deal with it as dana said to recognize it put a name to it anger frustration but now go from that place to say how can i change the narrative of the story so for me a few things one i had to start to think about and redefine what my place my role was as an attorney for my clients and i always thought about and i should and my first point is that i am their attorney and i have a job that i have to do and i have to represent them to the highest of my abilities and and that's what they deserve um and i truly believe and that's very personal for me but also thinking about all right my clients come from the most vulnerable populations in society whether they're black men from baltimore or they're people charged with legal re-entry and that don't have documentation to be in this country or they're i would have cases with women that were human trafficked right and now we're charged with helping that type of operation but they were victims and they are victims right and figuring out how can i speak to them about life right i'm not to be clear i'm not a counselor that's not who i am but i did feel i had a role and i had an obligation to try and reach them in a way that we can have some hope for the future and some semblance and some thought process about like all right this case will end and it may end with you going home you will go home at some point right what happens when you get home what is the plan what can we do so that you don't have to continue to forfeit and give up time because we don't have a lot of time we have a finite amount of time in this world right we just do and time always say to them time right whether it's years and in the federal system they the sentences are calculated in months which is i don't know why they did that but anyway explaining how many months 96 months is to somebody doesn't make sense that's like when people tell you how old is the baby 18 months okay 12 months okay got it a year and a half you could have said that right got it so 96 months is eight years i know that off top of my head because i have to talk to my clients about that type of stuff but in any event saying those months that you have to spend in you can never get back ever you can get back relationships probably you can get back money and material possessions jobs right you can get back opportunities maybe you can't get back that time right so let's figure out a way that you can stop forfeiting your finite most valuable press's research which is time yeah um and speaking to them also about like there were times i i started a book list that i send to my clients to read so that you don't waste the time in there also you know i don't want your mind that's good to just be stagnant inside this cage because that's where you are now that's just not even candy-coated the reality is it's a cage and figure out how they don't waste your time in there right and a lot of my clients dropped out as i said before at a very early age and now let's think about all right read and educate yourself about things and i try to give them books of different examples nelson mandela i think is a great example for them because he spent 27 years in prison and still got out and changed the world so understand that you have hope there was a point in the book where he speaks about he didn't think he was ever going home and why would you you're there for 27 years some point probably not right but he did and no one anyone that is aware of who he is now cannot argue that he didn't undoubtedly change the world anybody can and i think his story is amazing because he came from a very very you know meek and a pla unassuming play you would never think that this guy was going to be this world changer but anybody can preach christians [Laughter] so i try to just inspire that listen and i had a client when i had this conversation one time with a client and we had an argument and he wanted to get up and leave and i was like no you need to sit down we're not quitting yet right please don't disrespect me it was really about that in the moment i was a little i'll be honest i was angry with him like sit down and don't just disrespect me and walk out but he said listen listen christian you're a lawyer and i'm a criminal and i said to him i was like don't call yourself that anymore because with labels comes assumed in inferred behavior right so you say you're a criminal you act like one stop it and he had never heard that from a lawyer and then we had a dialogue come to find out he's an avid reader we had a whole bunch of books so i sent he'd never read nelson mandela so i sent him that one and then we started commuting that's where my book list idea came from because it reached him a light went on with him and now he has value and hope for the future i can't do that for everybody but as many as i can that's what i would like to do because all of my clients are people [Applause] it's so interesting i think as adults we talk a lot about the high profile cases and what's happening with the criminal justice system i don't spend most of my time talking with students that's not what's on their mind on a given day one quick story i was coming back from a basketball game that we won and i was we're struggling but we gonna get there i was taking a student to a bus stop and she's academically solid you know she's a really sweet girl and she's asking me had i heard about different crimes in the city and like we're just leaving a basketball game and she said did you hear about this 13 year old girl that was raped and she's literally pulling up on instagram you know the picture of the person that was arrested and i'm like no i hadn't heard about that then she's like and she just starts talking so she goes over that and there are two other things that she mentions and i cried after i dropped her off because at 16 this wasn't my conversation with my principal my parent nobody and we went from that conversation talking about you know some kids she knew that had been arrested and she just casually said and i'm so worried about my brother who's 21. so i'm so worried about him and we talked about that a little bit and then she moves from that conversation and she goes did i give you a valentine's day gift and what shocked me was just how quickly she moved from talking about violence to a gift for her principle and i was like really disturbed by the conversation but that's normal it's normal for teenagers to be so traumatized that it's now normalized that they're talking about violence and homicides and and who did what and school is on edge because they you know and so to me that's the crisis is that when are young people given a chance to just really unpack what is it like to be living in a war zone right and to also be so worried about relatives who are doing the absolute right thing and we don't make enough time and space to unpack that because i think we don't always have the answer but that just struck me that we're not talking about crime and you know criminal reform they're talking about literally is my brother going to be the next homicide victim yeah yeah i mean um i could talk about the political ramifications of all of this stuff um you got to really look at the timeline of events so we have probably probably the most divisive election presidential election in the history of our country following right after that or during that period of time we had the pandemic which we hadn't dealt with and who knows how long and then during that time we still have all these racial issues that are continuously happening they never stop they're just continuously happening and so it's created an atmosphere that i've noticed within our school district where you know i'm in a rural county um in carroll county which is mostly republican we are in a democratic historically democratic state in maryland and so um it creates an environment of divisiveness that i've never seen before most people before the pandemic had never been to a school board meeting nobody had any interest in going to a school board meeting they really didn't care they just trust most parents here you just trust your your kids with the school district hey they're doing do the right thing they're educators and so now um you know it's standing room only in these meetings it is uh divisive it is aggressive it is all the things that you would say that would make this country ugly you would see in these school board meetings and it's all brought about because it has now become a political grandstand area where people can come and just spew their political views about stuff that has nothing to do with whatever that's on the agenda that they're talking about um which puts our children in a really interesting spot because they come to school and they have parents that are trying to prove a political point right so i take the mass for instance right yeah some people are pro-mass probably in this room some people pro-match some people against mass with a masked man they came out parents were telling their kids don't go to school with the mask go to school without one and i don't care what happens i'm we're gonna make a point now the kid doesn't have a choice mom tells you what to do when you're 15 16 years old you're gonna do a mile all right i guess i'll go to school with no mass going fine whatever and we were dealing with that all throughout the pandemic and even now you know you still deal with some of those things so the mind job that it plays on kids that now uh they're not free to be who they are because of the pressure of their parents because the pressure of the political climate of today is really really profound to me and we have to find a way where we can reduce that as much as possible people talk about getting back to normal it's not gonna be normal we have to get back to it's okay to disagree with stuff but still go out to lunch it's okay to disagree with things but still be good with one another and we i felt like we used to be there at some particular point and we are so far away from that now it's crazy yeah i think that's real huge why the church has to be a picture point of that whether you're republican or democrat in here or an undecided party i think that we have to know our biggest nature of understanding who we are comes from christ before it comes from our culture and if we don't get i'm a child of the king first then we will always put the preference of our skin color the preference of what we have heard or grown up on or again a political party as the front-running piece of determining who we are what we say how we impact or how we make a difference and so i think that's a big point where you guys are going to say something i was just going to say the question was what can we hope for and i think what these cases allow us to do is have conversation what we can hope for is conversation in conversation we are disarmed in conversation we are informed in conversation we find safety with one another when when it's a good conversation and there are healthy mature adults in it you know because we have to um as christian said earlier it's a problem for all of us it's not just a black white thing or asian hispanic thing it's a problem for all of us and i think the hope that i have is that we will have more conversations about what race matters in america how it impacts us and how we as a body of christ can show the world difference right that we can work together that we do love one another it's one of the things i'm excited for like in my head i see like um commercials for the dream center right with all of these different kinds of people serving and working and loving on our community no matter where we are and how we are and who we are i think we have to have just these conversations with one another about how these things impact us not skirt around it not not deal with it not not know what to say you know just as an ally just how are you you know how how do you feel about what would open up conversation for real expression and then us being able to dialogue back and forth you know i think this generation we we really want to make some progress yeah we really want to make some progress and i think the way to do it is to continue the conversation and to lift up the fact that we really are better together and we really are more alike than we are different but just we have to be in conversation constantly and amplifying that conversation and this would be a great time for a plug for mixed groups so if you're not in a mix group we want you to get in a mix group you can sign up for one online you can go to the mix church app and get that and be a part of a mixed group and get into community so that you can begin conversation about what it is to be a child of god and be different continue yeah i just wanted to add on to what you were saying pastor marcus as far as this is a moment in time where the church is really needed you know god's love is the solution towards racial injustice you can't fight hate with hate you can only fight hate with love and god's love and being as though like we are in a position as a church like to have these conversations so today like what we did two services this is impactful and i believe like we should continue to carry the torch to have these conversations to bring a mixed group of people plug um to talk about racial injustice because i feel as though like we all have something to learn from each other no one's better than the other man or woman we all children of god and we can learn from each other to make a change in our environments in our world so the church is definitely needed and i really believe that god is saying like tr like take care of this moment well you know don't don't let this go under the rug but really be a cloak of peace and love to the people into the to the world at large you know the the funny thing about race right no i yes absolutely for brother the the the crazy thing about race is the race as we know it now was actually a business model it was a business model it was it was it was redefined in the slave trade on purpose as a business model to to to to maximize profits yeah race in to to think about all the different backgrounds of human beings that there are in this country or in the world and to try and classify us into like five or six groups is just stupid it doesn't make any sense there is a huge rainbow continuum of people yeah in any community you look at you want to say it's the black community look how diverse the black community can be look how diverse the latino community the white community age it doesn't matter any community is super diverse because the concept of race was only to make money and now those those classifications now are still in our society ripping it apart the the thing i loved about this church and what i was talking about in the earlier experiences the mix i love the concept of a group of people from all different walks of life and backgrounds and experiences coming together for one common goal and realistically absolutely and that's all from pastor marcus like don't know clap for me but that's him that's him yeah that's god there you go that's god [Music] that and that's the thing with our country that's what we should be doing in our country we have the ability to bring a group of people from every walk of life come to this one central place we can take all the best benefits from all these different backgrounds and life experiences from all over the world literally for the good of the common unit that is forming here and instead of doing that we focus on these five or six classifications of race to continue to be divided so that a select few at the very very top that you know are the descendants of the people that started that business model continue to reap the benefits of us fighting each other over the scraps that are left behind that doesn't make any sense talk about it that's real that was great i was just going to say like that you also have to understand the just the political side of things and why certain things are the way that they are and unless you really honestly do your research around you know why what these political parties stand for like i said most republican and democrats actually don't have a problem with each other personally they don't their kids go to the same schools right they dinner with each other they really honestly don't have an issue we're the ones having the issue right and it is meant to really divide us to the place where certain people stay in power and where you all feel as though you don't really have a voice so why bother right why reach out to my congressman nothing's gonna happen anyway so now a person that's supposed to work for you he's chilling or she's chilling because i don't think i did nowhere because ain't nobody calling me because i don't know how to do anything right you have to force people to do what they're supposed to do and democracy is made to work for you the people and if we we the people aren't doing what we need to do then that's an issue and a problem i think through this pandemic you know and i'll talk about it later like putting your money where your mouth is like you can't just be on social media i've seen posts you know you're speaking out about you know freddie gray or this that in the third and you're saying yeah you know you got the black fists and all some of the type of stuff that you're you're putting out there what are you doing what time are you committing to changing things right and if everybody it don't take a lot you know guys you know spend you know 20 hours of your day doing something but a little bit of your time being a part of an organization meeting with the congressman right being at a school board meeting speaking up for one minute or two minutes of your time that's not a large amount if we do it in the masses this country will change this city will change but we can't sit on the back burners and just scroll through social media and feel good because we like a post that says something about racial injustice and be like yeah see i did my part i hit like that's not enough yeah i think that's really really really really really good and i think that we have to be that example i think the reason that we're coming together as a church and we're not the only church but we're coming together as a church to say it because i really believe we're the church that can make the impact um spiritually mentally physically to put our community back into the shape that it needs to be in because if you have a healthy person a healthy person goes out to find another sick person to make them healthy and so sick people trying to help sick people is going to get us nowhere if we don't become healthy ourselves i believe us as the local church we're called to make the impact and make the change and make the difference in our city in our nation and in our world and that's why you've got to be at the mix and that's why you can't just be a consumer but you got to be a contributor and that's why you can't sit back and complain about what's happening but you have to step forward and say i'll be a part of it i'll serve people that are different than me i'll give to what god is telling us to give to so that we can reach further and go further and make an impact and make a difference and say how can i serve somebody today how can someone that is uh white standing at the door speak to someone is black and someone black at the door speak to someone who's white and you're like i don't have time for that pastor and god is saying you have time to make a difference and so i think that's so important i think it's important that we make sure that we understand the validity of what god is calling for us to do as a church because if we're not making an impact then all we are doing is gathering together with people that are just like us to have a good time on sunday and go back into our communities to see our city stay where it's at and look at tv and instagram and complain about and say i wish they would do something well we are the answer to the brokenness of our city and our world that god is calling us to and i believe that once you see yourself get active then you'll have the ability to say i'm out here making a difference as you say and i'm putting my mouth to what i actually believe and i'm doing something to make a difference in the world today and i am so grateful i just want real quick real quick means real quick it says that real quick um i want you to give just real quick um your thought basically on what you're doing what you're focused on and how you're making an impact to see what you believe is an issue change so for me i think one thing i'm dealing with in schools is just how young people are responding to conflict um i'm definitely trying to invest a different level of support um for our girls um i think a lot of times talk about black boys i think our girls are on a different level of crisis as well i'm so really thinking about how to make sure that we're not just developing the academic mind but developing womanhood and so that's something i'm really committed to is just again making sure my girls and their mothers in some cases just have the support to make sure that we're going to have healthy whole families i think one of the things we're focused on i think dana said it earlier is that there's only 3.8 of clinicians of color and so one of the things we're committed to as a team is building new clinicians of color new social workers investing in them pouring into them helping them to develop professionally and personally so that they are available to the masses and just to add on to that um working with men helping men to heal helping them to understand healthy thought processes around masculinity so that they are not dying internally and externally so that's my focus is to help the men speak on their healing so i've started to teach take individual classes as an agile professor and and what i've tried to do and my emphasis on that is not only teach you obviously the rules i have to do that and teach you the law but teach you the actual practice of it so you'll see a video of what a stop and frisk looks like and i can say to you i've been through that as a black man right and you understand and impress upon them the human cost of what's going on because they will be attorneys that can go out into the community and make change as well just so that everybody has a role in this yeah for me um just continue to work around diversity and equity in my school district giving black and brown students a voice i find that you know to be one of my most important things um also to tackle the mental health issues that are going on within our county and beyond young people are struggling so i will continue to do that was featured on nbc today show about them will continue to do that work also president-elect of maryland association and secondary school principals be able to lobby for different things that are going on within our own government to support our teachers and support our administrators the way they need to be supported and lastly i'm executive board member of the red cross in central maryland to help when disaster strikes to be
