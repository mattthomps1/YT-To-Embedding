[Music] we have had an amazing time today and so grateful for all that god has done and is doing if i can tell you so and i really believe that uh the lord is speaking in the house you said pastor you see what time it is [Music] i'm just already saying what y'all thinking don't mean to act like y'all wasn't thinking that [Music] you turned over to you whoever you came with how long what you think you're gonna do like how long i think you're gonna be it's been a call sunday no i'm not i'm not gonna do that to you but can you jump in your bibles real quick so i can pour some things into you real quickly [Music] and believe that god is going to do something i believe deliverance is in the house i believe freedom is in the house i believe healing is in the house in jesus name we're closing out our series in week four the truth about jesus we're going to jump into the word of god i want to jump first at the scripture at matthew chapter 28 verses 19 through 20. this is jesus's commission to his disciples after his resurrection before his ascension and the bible lets us know that he gives instruction because if jesus is with you that means he's going to instruct you on what to do because he says my sheep know my voice and if the lord is speaking it means he's instructing god isn't speaking to create because he's created everything that he needs to create so he's instructing or giving revelation to the next direction so the bible says that this is a commission that he gives to the disciples verse 19 he says to them go therefore and make disciples of all nations somebody say all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and it says in teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and behold he says this which is good to underline he says i am with you to the end of age [Music] and then we get the acts and jesus is gone wait what jesus he said this you said you were going to be with me until the end of age [Music] when the bible says [Music] the lord doesn't lie so if jesus is going to be with us to the end of age how is he going to be with us to the end of age that means if he has sins he's got to send somebody to be with us because jesus says what i've commissioned you to do is literally impossible he says i'm calling you the reason why i pulled out that all nations he says i'm calling you to the jews first and then i'm calling you to everybody else to get this message across so that in 2020 that we would be standing here talking about this gospel he says well how in the world are we going to do that jesus if you're saying you're going to leave us jesus says i'm sending you somebody somebody say who we're going to talk about the holy spirit today acts chapter 1 starting in verse 4 says this and while staying with them he ordered them not to depart [Music] from jerusalem but to do what somebody say wait tell your neighbor real quick wait tell your other neighbor real quick wait tell your third choice i'm sorry i'm a third choice but wait [Music] he said wait [Music] for the promise of the father it says which he said you heard from me [Music] for john baptized [Music] with water we had five baptisms on last sunday can y'all help me celebrate them in the house yeah also for those of you that don't know who i am my name is pastor marcus england i'm the pastor here at the mix welcome let's jump back in this bible real quick he said so john baptized with water we're so excited you made the decision to follow jesus you have declared openly that jesus is your savior and you're declaring to the world which baptism is is an open declaration as you are washed the bible says an old person goes down but a new person comes up it says what a baptism that's what that is it is the our acknowledgement of newness of life transformation happening but jesus says it doesn't stop they tell your neighbor real quick it don't stop there because he said for john baptized you with water so there's a baptism of salvation the baptism of water he says but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now so now we're talking about the baptism of the holy spirit he says so when they had come together they asked lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel he said to them it's not for you to know mind your business it's not for you to know the times or seasons that the father has fixed by his own authority he says but somebody say but after a butt is always good but god it's always something good after but he said but what i want to let you know is the commission that i place upon your life the purpose that i set over you what i called you to do the very thing in your mind that you're saying there's no way that god would use me for he says but what i have called you to he says you're going to need something more than a good will and a strong line so that's why he says what wait stop being all anxious you got saved and baptized i love jesus i'm going i'm gonna change the world out here he says yes yes yes i love that but hold on wait a second you're gonna need something more because in two weeks when life gets rough you're gonna want to try to quit and i need something on the inside of you that will keep you consistent to my word and to my purpose over your life so that you don't fall back into the old you so he says [Music] but you will receive power somebody say power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witness my witness [Music] you you won't witness for me you'll be a witness your life will be my witness where you go will be my witness not that you went to church on sunday your life will be my witness some of us are trying to talk people into jesus but our lives look so dysfunctional that they can't believe your witness it says you'll be my my witness he says in jerusalem in all judea and samaria you're like well i don't live in any of those areas so what about me he says i got you don't worry about it it says and to the end of the earth this last verse it says and when he said these things as they were looking on he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of sight anybody know when you pray and god give you a word but he don't give you the rest of the word he just give you that half of the word and you'll be like well what's the other part he'll be like mind your business not time for you to know that's what prayer is god gives you a glimpse of where you're going and then tells you to come back mind your business it's not time for you to know yet you'd be like what well how am i supposed to act out of that he says faith well how is the church going to be powerful if it's given a testimony that god's a healer god can open the eyes of the blind he can do all these things and you're witnessing about it but you're not a witness of it see a lot of times we like talking about what we think we saw or think we read anybody at google anybody have a phd in google like you will swear in a conversation real quick that you know everything y'all been there man that's a pelican that ain't no pelican [Music] [Applause] that's a tn b's cock-a-doodle if you would know we love repeating stuff that we just read real quick and we're trying to be a witness of something we haven't experienced [Applause] so while we can get facts which we don't really know at their facts when we become a witness and the lord has healed your body and the lord has changed your life and the lord has restored your family and the lord has broken the chains off your life you become the witness [Applause] is walking the court i saw everything that happened i was right there and i got video oh that well dang because it's my life mark chapter 16 verse 17 through 18 says this and these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up serpents with their hands and if they drink any deadly poison probably them five hour energy drinks that's what he's talking about anyway it says it when i hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover that's what he said how you feeling you fry why would you what you talking about pastor we had outreach together she said pastor i didn't come last sunday because my back is hurting and i'm gonna try to make it this week she said but i'm just not sure i said cool the bible says and signs will follow them so what we do we pray father in the name of jesus heal her back right now so that she can move and come she said we were inside the clothing store together and she said to me pastor it's getting better i said i know no no here's what i want to give you because if you go further on an axe after they receive the holy spirit which i'm gonna get to peter and john said why are you looking on me as if i did it ain't got nothing to do with this not my power not my might it's by the spirit [Applause] so what he says is the church is supposed to be operating in the spirit that brings about the giftings that can cast out the broken areas and people's lives and bring healing in the name of jesus mark 16 says the church proves it's the church through the giftings of the holy spirit because we'll talk about the witness but the problem is we won't have any experience with the witness that's what separates the church from being powerful or entertaining it's the power within the church just tell your neighbor real quick we need the power so so so mark chapter 16 says listen there's something coming there's a baptism of salvation when you see me give the prayer lord jesus i give my heart to you i give my life to you make me who you want me to be lord the bible says immediate right there their salvation takes place and we begin to walk that salvation out then we move to the next stage which is water baptism in water baptism we find ourselves saying now i'm making this outward declaration what i've done in my heart becomes outward and i'm now deciding lord jesus i want to make this our declaration that the old me is going away but there is a new me that you are transforming me into and we celebrate and we give god the praise but we do not stop there tell your neighbor real quick don't stop there we need the holy spirit the bible says the baptism of the holy spirit so you're wondering why some people are successful in their christian walk and others aren't it's through the power of the holy spirit some of us we have the holy spirit but we have not been baptized in the holy spirit which is the working power of the holy spirit can we jump in this to it real quick point number one when you receive the holy spirit you receive power real quick the title of the message is jesus descender got it all right point number one when we have the holy spirit we receive somebody say power we receive power we receive power we receive power we receive power [Applause] oh we receive power we receive power oftentimes you're wondering well what what is god saying about this power what can i receive the power i'm telling you today you're supposed to receive the power you're inclined to say it is yours it is due to you [Applause] i was reading in john chapter 1 verse 12 and the bible lets us know to those in whom we go through the scriptures to those into whom i'll read it in this version is that yet to all who did receive him to those who believe in his name he gave the bible there's one version that says the power to become the children of god it's not going to be up there i'm sorry but it's john chapter 1 verse 12 verse 13 it says children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husband's will but born of god and it says so there's an authority you're given the right you're given the power to be called sons and children of god i'm a son and child of god but when we get to acts chapter 8 he says you shall receive power a different kind of power in the translation of greek which is dynamous somebody say didymus i was like uh i'm not speaking no greek i don't know what that is did in this power that's where we get the word dynamic from it means a power that's not just for the salvation sake of ownership in the kingdom it's power that is bestowed upon us denim as dynamite power to live out and to be everything that god has called for us to be to break the yokes of bondage the yokes of addiction the oaks of sexual identity challenges the oaks of sexual areas in our life that we find ourselves wrapped up in he says this i want to give you the holy spirit because in your transformation you cannot do it of yourself but i'm calling you to have the spirit of the living god so it's not about being better then it's about the operating of the holy spirit on the inside that's what changes me not the mindset that i'm better it's the holy spirit who knows the mind of christ as corinthians tells us and the mind of christ puts us in connection with his mind and our spirit the holy spirit that's connected that lets me know greater things beyond what i could even imagine or think that whatever god has called me to do i can do it can you tell your neighbor real quick whatever god's called you to do you can do it y'all looking at each other like yeah listen here it's getting hard but the bible says we have the holy spirit but you shall receive power you shall receive power dynamis power why am i not successful in my christian walk because i don't have power i need the power of the holy spirit here's why because sunday is not enough to break what the enemy has been doing in your life since birth the pride the anger the division the hurt that has been in your life incorporated in it those are areas that god is saying i can break when you have the holy spirit living and operating living and operating living and operating now you're working off of something you did 15 years ago living and operating in your life the point number two when you have the holy spirit you become a witness unto jesus the second verse of verse 8 says and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth there's nothing like witnessing and trying to tell others about jesus when you try to tell them about a jesus that you don't really have a relationship with you ever had somebody try to tell you they know somebody [Applause] you know like they brag on it oh yeah i know them you know we y'all took that one picture down there that you choked him out to take a picture with you now all of a sudden you got a tight relationship with them can i tell you that's like when you give your heart to god and then never come back to him [Applause] you spend no time with him no devotion time with him and you want what god to do something supernaturally inside of you and god says here's the problem here's where we're messing up you're void of my spirit so that means you have to rely on your own will he says you need the holy spirit to be able to do so he says you you need to be a witness somebody say a witness i had a couple couple weeks well actually a couple months ago now where my car was parked and somebody sideswiped it it was just it was parked now i can admit if i did it some of y'all looking at me questioning me i see the face i did not do it it was parked and somebody hits the car and keeps going the person behind them witnessed it got their license plate tried to you know get the person to pull over i was like i think you went a little too far i i just said i appreciate you you know but it's a little tricky out here in this world so i don't you know don't don't go being you know hawaii 5-0 or anything i don't need you chasing nobody [Applause] and they left the note on the car and said somebody hit your card this is who call me you know the difference between having a witness and somebody just saying they think i think he's a healer i'm pretty sure he could open some blind eyes i think what happens in court without a witness i throw it out right you got to prove something you got to have some evidence there's got to be some some evidence bible says you know what one of the evidences of it is point number three we speak in tongues y'all like oh this that weird church they about to start tripping mike i'm about to slip i'll actually put a book bag on i'm out there i'm just playing actually i'm just playing i'm out of here can i tell you what the bible says about speaking in tongues acts chapter 2 verse 4 it says this and they were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit as the spirit as the spirit gave them utterance not on their own not in their own way not in the disruption not flipping over the pew not flipping over the chair not acting like they got no sense it says as the spirit gave utterance they spoke can i tell you about tongues i know your heart thumping a little bit but i'm on point number three i know what that means we're done [Applause] y'all like yeah that's all right that is right i didn't even notice that he done already first corinthians chapter 14. paul he speaks this starting at verse two he says this for one who speaks in the tongue speaks not to men but to god there is a communication between you and god that the responsibility is for you to let god take control and the biggest area of our life that we suffer with is that we don't want god to take full control that's why tongues will seem scary is because that means i have to give up and that i'm going to tell you the biggest hindrance in relationship with god is we don't want to give up control so we want to maintain our christianity with the things we like and the way we want it and god can come in when we need him to help us for the things we need and then we take back over right and we repeat what we just did because every time we take control we mess it up and while you can successfully move in life you feel empty on the inside it says for one who speaks in the tongue speaks not to men but to god it says for no one so when you heard people speak in tongues and you'd be like that is crazy here's what i want to let you know you weren't supposed to understand it anyway unless the bible says paul speaks this in the accompanying of people that there is a prophecy that goes out that is connected with that tongue but in your devotional time with god in your secret place in your car where the windows are tinted you can have it [Applause] you being there and people never really like like what in the world and you just flowing you're like i'm not crazy just move your head back and forth just be like yeah they'd be like they're listening to music i think must be a fast rapper because the lord is just giving it it says for no one understands him but he utters somebody say mysteries if he utters mysteries it means there's a lack of understanding that's going to happen in the natural realm for you to be able to grasp what's taking place that's why it's a spiritual thing so the bible says he utters mysteries in the spirit on the other hand the one who prophesied speaks to people for the what of building and encouragement and consolation so it says the one who speaks in tongues built himself up the one who prophesies builds up the church real quick the one who speaks in tongues builds himself up why do you needing building up because you don't always have a motivation person beside you to put you back into the place that your new mindset needs to go so the bible says he begins to edify you and when you're in your private moment with god and begin to speak your heavenly language the lord begins to speak to you and give you what a supernatural move that you cannot explain how did you know to take that job i was with god in the supernatural i began to speak and he began to flow he encouraged my soul he moved in me so i'm no longer waiting for sunday to happen for edifying to take i'm moving by the power of the holy spirit pastor i need a word today you need the holy spirit and you need time with him so you can be edified outside of sunday [Music] because it has power dynamics power dynamic power to change your life that's when you yield to the holy spirit so you're saying if there's a problem with yielding in my heart it means there's an absence of the active power of the holy spirit the active power of the holy spirit doesn't just take you and make you like you want to be it gives you direction to get to where you need to be so whether it's counseling [Music] whether it's help mentally physically emotionally the holy spirit leads and directs so you don't have an excuse to stay the way that you are and he will change you [Music] today our jesus is the center of the holy spirit he said the father will send you a comforter so that's why he said at the end of the scripture i'll be with you always even until the end of age are you going to be with me jesus my holy spirit will be inside of you and it will be an activated power to change you that's why today we honor the presence of the lord and we acknowledge we need the holy spirit can anybody say today i need the holy spirit i need the holy spirit i need the holy spirit active i need the holy spirit active i'm leaving out on this note so you don't get worried but here's what i want to let you know you can stay because there's something about the presence of god that wants to transform you and the holy spirit can do that today church is more than a service it is the place where you come together with people that are like-minded that's why you don't have to be fearful when you come into the presence of god or you need prayer or you need a moment because you're in a place and an environment created for it it would look weird if you came down to your boss's office and be like can i get prayer prayer what does it look like a church and then we get to church and reject prayer [Music] but it's the place and the environment created for you to receive not the place in the environment for you to show off it's just like i need the holy spirit today and if that's the next thing that's going to break the bondage in my life for the bible says you can only serve two masters you either hate one and love the other my question today is will you surrender yourself to jesus and in surrendering yourself will you allow the holy spirit to take control today's message is about moving from religion to relationship [Music] and to be empowered by the spirit of god let's pray in this place father in the name of jesus we thank you so much we declare right now [Music] that we want your spirit in this place take control take over have your way do whatever you want to do come in us live in us change us we need your holy spirit today i need your holy spirit today to doing me what i cannot do of myself father i pray today for those of us that have been saved even for a long time i pray that we would re-engage with your presence while we know your information we don't know your presence while we understand the bible we don't understand your presence while we can quote scriptures we don't understand your presence your presence sets us free so i pray today we be set free in the name of jesus for we love honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen come on help me celebrate god in this place [Applause] amen pastor you apologize today no i don't apologize why because i know it's an opportunity for us to really have the presence of god move in our church and i'm so grateful that you stayed and you're connected and a part of the moment here's what i want to let you know i'm not angry of you you're like hey i ain't coming down i'm not angry god's not angry god's working on us he's changing us day by day moment by moment and as you keep surrendering he'll change you this is not a one and done if i can tell you real quick i went to a revival and saw people receiving the holy spirit i never forget walking out of there because i felt like i didn't go to the altar and i should have and i wanted the holy spirit i wanted to be baptized in the holy spirit i never forget i kept saying it over and over i want the holy spirit god empty me of anything that's like not like you and i'm here today to let you know i had to be a teenager i don't know how old i was but i'll never forget i was in my room and laid prostrate on the floor and i just kept saying jesus i need your holy spirit jesus i need your holy spirit i can't do it without you and i never forget i began to speak in tongues and the lord baptized me in the holy spirit and i laid on the ground now let me tell you the kind of house i grew up in is that they knew about this and my parents prayed over me and went into their room here's why because god doesn't need any help he doesn't need assistance he didn't need somebody to conjure it up in me he didn't need to take me in the back room and make it happen it was my heart that was open to do what he said do when i said lord jesus i want to receive your spirit i went in and laid all night and just began to speak in tongues and the lord filled me with his holy spirit and he's working constantly in me daily but i want to let you know the spirit is offered to you today
