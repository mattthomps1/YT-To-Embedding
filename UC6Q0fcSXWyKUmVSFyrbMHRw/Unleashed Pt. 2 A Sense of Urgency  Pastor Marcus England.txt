[Music] thank you Romans chapter 12 verses 1 through 2 and it starts with this it says therefore I urge you Brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as Living Sacrifice holy and pleasing to God this is your true and proper worship and verse 2 comes in and says this and do not conform to the pattern of this world but B somebody say transformed be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you will be able to test and approve what God's will is his good pleasing and perfect will I want to come from the topic this morning a sense of urgency a sense of urgency can we pray father we ask in your name to give us a sense of urgency in Jesus name amen amen thank you so much musicians appreciate you y'all can y'all help me give it up for our Dream Team our volunteers that are are part of making it come on y'all help me celebrate them big today just tell your neighbor real quick let's get into this in Romans 1 through 11 what we understand that the writer of Paul is describing to us and giving us clarity that there is something that God has done that he has sent his son Jesus Christ to this earth to be able to die for the sins of the world and through this blood sacrifice we are now forgiven forever for our sins what he brings to Clarity is that from an Old Testament standpoint from the church and the Jews in which he were speaking to in Rome he wanted to let them know it is no longer by the sacrifices of turtle doves and of lambs that sins are now covered but he said according to the sacrifice that Jesus Christ has made we are now set free from the bondage of sin and death somebody say Amen right there it's an amen moment because you must understand according to the way it was set up it did not look like you and I if you are not of an Israel Heritage that you were to be included it would be that you would have been on the outside of the promise that abrahamic promise that had been given to the people of Israel but what God is is not a god of exclusion he is a god of inclusion and because he understands that all creation is magnificent it is a masterpiece it is something to see and to behold he said guess what I'm not going to keep this with only one group of people I am going to open this up to not only Jews but gentiles and so Paul writes this letter not only to the Jews in Rome but also to the Gentiles in Rome and he says through chapter 1 through 11 there are the mercies of God that has been established he wants to let us know that it had not been a for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the sacrifice of what he did on Calvary you would not be here today you would be messed up drowning in your mess every mistake that you made you would have been accused and rightfully sentenced right where you were but by the grace of God but by the mercies of God he has extended the ability for you to be able to get up and walk again the Bible says you were yet dead in your sins but yet Christ has done what he has come to revive you and bring you to life again and this promise is now yours but it is only because he's a mercy merciful god he gives the clarity to understand because what he wants you to know is that Christ has paid an ultimate sacrifice for you to be where you are today I don't know if you understand this but whether you know it or not you are free through the blood of Jesus Christ you no longer are condemned to your old ways your old sins that owe you you know the old you the one you deleted the pictures off of IG when you started seeing a new you come about you say oh no they can't see that that wasn't a good year for me you can't you can't know what I did that year you don't want to know what I used to look like in the things that I used to do and so we we hide it and we put it away and and we put a mirage around it but there is something that the Bible says uncovered and fresh looking at it all your destructive ways all your broken ways all your mess are thinking all of the things you got addicted to the things that happened to you he says but by the mercies of God I've come to let you know that Christ has prayed the ultimate sacrifice so that you and I can be called brothers and sisters that we can be a part of what is this kingdom of God we are not just as we are joint heirs with Christ Jesus today and it's all because of his mercies the Bible says because of his mercies that we are not consumed for his compassion faileth not his mercies are new every morning great it's the faithfulness of our God and as we speak and declare and understand what this very little understanding I don't know why he chose me but he did I don't know why he saved me but he did I don't know what all my mess and my destructive thinking in my crazy ways he chose me it did not want to be honest you didn't deserve to be chosen anybody want to be real all the mess that you have done and all the chaos that you have created anybody know you weren't the first to be chosen but had it not been for the grace of God had it I've been for the love of God he would not have chose you but by his mercies I thank God they're new every morning it's by his mercy so Paul says I want to set you up so that you understand through the testimony of those who know Jesus the sacrifice that he laid on calvary's Cross I want to tell you so much that you don't deserve it but you have been afforded anybody ever know at times you find yourself in the place where there's some things that you want to ask God but you just feel like you've lost the qualifications to ask them anybody ever been there before you want to ask them for something but you thought about what you did yesterday you're like ah I'm not really in position to ask God give me about two weeks at church and let me make one prayer call and if I can hold one day on a fast I should be good to go I put myself in space I'm really good to go I'm I'm at a place I really feel like I could I can ask God now but anybody ever fail I'm just not worthy right now to ask God of what to do I thought about this oftentimes I I remember asking when you're when you're young and you need permission and you know state of your parent when you go to ask for something you create the condition so that the yes is easy anybody know about that yeah you I was when I was young I want to go to a friend's house I want to go outside I wanted to hang with somebody I want to do something I would create a condition that would leave as less negative impact on what the answer would be so what I would do I'm going to introduce this word to some of my Millennials and and my younger Generations we had these things called chores yeah let me describe chores to you it was a responsibility and child labor law broken for you to go into the house no matter if you were two feet three feet and your responsibility was to clean something I don't care what it was you would have wiped the table you you were to take out the trash you were to clean your room it didn't matter and so what what you would know is in order to really get the answer you want you had to be proactive and I knew my mother was coming home from work and I wanted to do something on a Friday night right after Bible study because Bible study that wasn't an option so I was going but after Bible study I wonder so what I did was I would take the day and I would go in Young when I was small and clean my room and make sure the things that have been accredited for me to be able to do I made sure they were in order and when my mother got home I greeted her well was your day I'm setting the stage for what I want I'm trying to create this idea because there's a big ask on the way and and and so I do that and I'm I'm asking and so hey Mom waiting for the right time the right moment hey uh can I ask you a question I wanted to know if I if I could go over over Jacob's house after we left it you know I've taken care and you start listening everything you've done I've taken care I watched that I made sure the room was clean I vacuumed I got in the corner like you told me I wiped the TV down everything you asked me to do I take care of it you think it's gonna be okay and you know so you would get a good answer yeah yeah if you've done what you're supposed to do yeah yeah go for it then we would get to an older age I would I would be now asking for a vehicle because I wanted to go somewhere y'all know how you want to go somewhere and back in the day you used to have to borrow your parents cars for a long time now we just buy you a card to just leave us alone you know because if you grow up in my time the car your parents had at that moment it don't look good at all anymore it got so many dings and dents and you they just they had patience y'all and I'll never forget I would I would make sure the house was together make sure things were in order I even learned to cook y'all hey man I just took a year I took your dinner and just want to make sure everything was you good all right hey real quick you got any plans because if you don't have any plans I would love to be able to take the car and so you go through this process because there's a big ask well Pastor why are you bringing this up Paul understands there's a big ask Romans chapter 12 verse 1 there's a big ass that he's about to give and he needs to set up the picture so that he can get this Clarity that all of what I've explained to you is so important to the moment that's about to come up because what I'm about to ask of you goes beyond culture goes beyond normalcy and so I want to set you up to understand that the ass matches the sacrifice so in verse 1 he goes and he says I urge your brothers and sisters he gives all of that in view of gods remember what I remember what I told you he said that that's why we started off with therefore see therefore is the continuation of remember what we were talking about all right so therefore since you understand let me bring you over to this ask he said in view of God's mercies to offer your bodies as living sacrifices excuse me excuse me Living Sacrifice what do you mean because here's what they they were trying to get is that there was no paganism paganism means that there would be a sacrificing of someone there would be a sacrificing of an individual that was alive but they did not believe in that and then when it came the sacrifice here's what I want to let you know is that normally the individual that was offering the sacrifice was not the one who gave the sacrifice he says I want you to offer a sacrifice ah this is so unique to the moment because now you become the one who is offering the sacrifice you become the sacrifice and you become the priest who offers the sacrifice to God now we're playing all positions so Paul says I understand the acts as big but here's what I want to let you know I need you to present all of you to God somebody say oh anybody any anybody don't um anybody don't like everybody to see all of us anybody want to edit some parts of your life out anybody want to do that don't don't see no don't do that anybody ever watch somebody do a video but you're not looking at the video you're looking at the background you'll be like your bedroom is dirty [Applause] [Music] you trying to teach me something but I can see you don't have your life together because I can feel of all that I want you to offer your body as a living sacrifice Paul States in this new relationship that you have with Christ in order for the relationship to really work you've got to give something here's a statement I want to let you know is that relationship has responsibility relationship I'm not I'm doing a relationship series next month but just to tip it real quick stop walking into a relationship thinking it is your responsibility to get without giving I'm looking for somebody to take care of me and you better take care of me I'm looking for somebody to look out for me and you better look out for me there is a responsibility in your relationship with God and the idea is not that God save you so you can sit with your feet up and ask God for every inheritance and blessing that you can possibly get without not having the responsibility of giving up something from yourself can I tell you it's real easy to give away things it's easy to give away money it's easy to tell somebody here's a car it's easier to tell somebody here's a house but to give yourself up y'all know how much we value ourselves you like you don't you some of y'all relate to church because you liked you too much [Applause] you were staring in that mirror all that my God look at oh my this is amazing oh selfie Sunday at the mix [Applause] there we go I don't even understand that picture right there it's the right angle that's what it it's Sunday at the mix you ain't been in seven months start my Sunday at the mix the church or a relationship as a responsibility and when we don't acknowledge that God is allowed to be in every part of our life we miss his impact on our lives the Bible says in Proverbs chapter 3 and 6 it says this in all our ways somebody say all in all our ways we are to acknowledge Him and when we acknowledge he will direct our path the problem is we acknowledge post our decision and we want God to fix what we've messed up or what we've walked into that he never declared was ours idea behind it is that you acknowledge Him somehow they say before because now your prayer after everything is going on is that God would get you out God free me God relieve me no God said you didn't ask me on your way in now you're trying to get me to get you out and the problem with it is is that I don't even break my own covenants so the things that you have solidified in Covenant I'm not just getting you out of it you're going to have to learn how to be able to live in it with peace and with understanding because I'm That Kind of God foreign can I tell you God's a little nosy don't talk about my God like that but God's nosy God wanna know where you're going when you going what time you going who you going with what y'all gonna be doing and you'll be like passing well you know we don't need to know all that he just he's just God over my life no he's God over your life in your life through your life for your life he won't know what you think and why you thinking let's get to the bottom of why you think like that he wants to see greatness happen inside of you but here's the thing you gotta offer your self he's not going to force you he's not going to make you get into your purpose and the destiny that God has called you to he cannot unleash what's inside of you by forth you have to offer your self when you offer yourself you put yourself in position to say God whatever it is do what you want to do I might kick I might scream I might lit my voice and scream no but whatever you do don't let go anybody ever been there before you know that you are a mess and if you had it your own way you would quit every time but anybody ever want to put God in a drama seat and say I don't care how much I'm fussing I don't care how much I'm yelling I don't care when I scream I don't care when I lose my mind don't you let go of me I can't afford for you to drop me where I am I'll lose my mind I'll lose everything I have if you don't hold on to me so even in the middle of the sauna when I'm trying to walk out and do my own thing don't you let me go in the middle of when my crisis hits and I'm losing my mind don't you let me go even in the middle of when I'm in doing my mess don't you let me go I was talking to a young lady named Gabby and we were at prayer yesterday and she was explaining to me I said what are you what are you asking God to do and she began to tell me and she said this statement that I thought was a great prayer she sent me she said to me she said I told God get to the root of it sure some of us we want God to clean it up enough so that people don't see it cleaned up enough that guests on the first floor yeah y'all to take everything upstairs like if they go around the corner it's going to be Anarchy like like there's a stack of stuff that shit's holding its place like how many more hours we got cause I'm about to go like if you go upstairs and around the corner it's done anybody ever been in for like like that's the way we're living it out but when you are really at that place where you're sick and tired I mean sick and tired I'm tired of bowing I'm tired of living out of depression I'm tired of living out of anxiety I'm tired of my bank account being where it is every time I get paid I'm tired of allowing this anxiety to work modern I am tired anybody just can say sometimes I am tired I'm tired of this addiction I'm tired of thinking so low about myself some of us know how to encourage everybody else but us we can see the potential in the world but cannot see it in US we can develop everybody give everybody a motivational speech we can sound like Les Brown we can sound like every motivational speaker but when we get to the mirror we see ourselves and say what you think you think it's possible you need to be able to be in the place that you've offered yourself to God in such a way that he says to you you are my daughter you are my son and there's nothing that can change that so hold your head up tell your neighbor real quick hold your head up you're God's child [Applause] stop thinking so low of yourself walk with some confidence put some swag in your step [Applause] pull out that bank card like you got money on it try it again [Applause] it's just you just got such strength try it again he might have deposited something on it right in between the moment of me fearful and me being faithful and so I'm just saying anybody have a moment like that try it again I know it failed the first time try to get I know I messed up on the first go-round but try to get I know I didn't have it all together but try to get tell your neighbor try it again oh I may have jacked it up last year but try it again [Applause] [Music] I'm Gonna Keep swiping [Applause] go in that wall and pull out every card you got try that one try that one try that one sir that is a bus ticket try it try it might have dollars on it I don't know [Applause] [Music] and here's the reason why God gets to do this in your life First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 20 says this for you were bought at a price the Bible says therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit and then it takes you right back so that you understand which are gods it's not yours this is me I can do whatever I want no not if you've been bought not if you're a Living Sacrifice this idea that I can have God and do it the way I want is not scriptural it's against God's word it doesn't make sense you can't convince me why because his word says for you abroad with a price so he gets to be in everything Lord You Wanna I wanna know about your finances I want to know about your mental state I want to know about your soul I want to know about how you feeling I want to know about your addictions I want to know about the places where you're groaning and moaning I want to know about the places where you feel uncomfortable I want to know about the places where the lower self-esteem is lying I want to know about the places where you're still hurting you don't have forgiveness I want to know because I'm the god that can change everything [Applause] when that happens you will be Unleashed to be everything that God has called for you to be and you will walk in the purpose and plan that God has for you but as long as you stay in your corner thinking you are the solution to your answer here's what you'll do you'll go and find people that are just like you who are not Unleashed who are bound who are sitting in their mess who are crying who are thinking negative and you will group with them because it's comfortable and easier for you to stay where you are Flash the good pieces of your life online and know that what the way that you're living out your life now is a mess and you wouldn't want to show it to anybody so Paul goes back at the top of verse 1 and says this I urge you can I urge somebody today can I tell you you got to have a sense of urgency some of us are walking and we strolling again strolling to the new year strolling strolling just hey hey how are you good to see you everything good hey everybody all right yeah yeah yeah strolling how you doing I'm doing good you want 21 days of prayer I'm trying what you doing trying to get my finances together because for some reason we think Financial change is going to change our life Financial change without a God to lead you in the right direction does nothing for you sorry to tell you so the context that we come to is we come strolling in the New Year what's up I'm good you good yeah I'm just you know here seeing what the new year brings in the new year is bringing in exactly what you're bringing in a lack of urgency which means that God is in no rush to meet the need that is burning in your heart because all you're letting him know is I'm just not ready and when you're not ready you live like you're not ready time is not of the urgency you are not pushing yourself into the uncomfortable spaces to see your life change you're looking for the most comfortable place where you can set your feet up and say you know what this year I'm just not going to get overwhelmed I won't be overdone I just don't have time for that what I'm going to do is just be able just only to do me and God is saying well I called you to offer yourself so how can you do me and do you that's tricky y'all because to do you means you gotta leave God to do you if you don't do you with God because God wants to do you with him if y'all do us [Applause] you get what I'm saying the idea behind it is that God is trying to act on your behalf to let you know that there is something that he can do in you that you cannot do of yourself but you must offer yourself here I am I come out of me my thinking my limited mindset which we're going to get to in verse 2. and I'm going to position myself to offer me to do whatever it is you want to do here is the clarity when we are really looking for God to change us we don't get a say and Who We Are all we are is a Living Sacrifice and sacrifices don't get up and move they stay where they are what you doing today the Lord pressed on my heart some of you I'ma let you know you'll be like I've never heard God speak yes you have you just didn't listen there was this thing unctioning feeling that you had that you were supposed to do and you said to yourself self do I feel like it when self said nope not today y'all let's try tomorrow you said sounds good to me high five self God said okay then go do you and you went out and tried to work it fix it up make it feel good you got some success you walked back and said I still feel the same way God said I told you because whatever it is that you thought you concoct up and put together you thought you were gonna be really good at so I'm gonna need my assistant real quick I was I was walking through this idea that in verse 2 it says this thank you thank you thank you appreciate that thank you so much thank you I appreciate that thank God he's always elevating me if you guys saw me in the hospital and I was walking I would be like hey Doc how you doing I'd be like it's just a white coat in verse 2 it says do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your what your mind needs renewing not culture upgrade not the opinions of others from a three second clip that you about to change your life off of that you sin 15 people because you want to be like this is the truth no you don't know how they live in you don't know nothing about them you have no clarity about their life and you have promoted them more than you promoted the word of God it says don't conform be transformed and it says once you're transformed in your mind then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is is good pleasing and perfect will it's important but the problem is is that too many of us start thinking we're doctors you know how we think we think highly of ourselves oftentimes and so what we do is we start gaining Knowledge from a broken world that cannot help us with the way in which to live a kingdom life and we find ourselves and we put on lab coat because after you've seen three Clips right of a good relationship series you know relationships you know how you do it because that's what they say and I agree and because I agree I repost because when I repost it makes me understand that I knew what I was talking about it don't have no consistency with God's word it has no connection and Clarity with the Bible it makes me even think do you believe in the Bible because there's got to be something that correlates your life because you've offered yourself as a Living Sacrifice but here's the problem you'll never be able to offer yourself as a Living Sacrifice if you do not renew your mind your mind will stay where it is it will think what it is it will think negatively it will think in a depressed mode it will come out thinking the way that it is the problem is is too many of us think we are something we are I want to let you know today that you are the creation and he is the creator but the problem is is too many of us have been walking around because we've seen ourselves give good advice to somebody we've taken on the position that we're God we got it all together we got it all under control listen to me and so we say now I'm a doctor he put a lab coat on me I'm a doctor well then if I'm a doctor it means I can operate this is a game from my past time called operation I don't know if you remember it but it was a good one and the jingle behind it was Operation you're the doctor and the problem if I can be honest is that in having a renewed mind many of us find ourselves in the place where we think that we have the ability to change guide spiritually and give adequate thought through our limited understanding of what God wants to do to change who we are on the inside and so we start self-medicating and we start self-improving to get ourselves to where we want to be and we become somebody say a doctor and we start getting ourselves in place where we're finding ourselves operating on things we have no Clarity on we don't know God's word we don't read God's word we don't study God's word we go to things that give us quick references with no background no understanding no Clarity and huge point no Holy Spirit and we get to operate I can change your life in 30 seconds if you can change my life in 30 seconds you're greater than God we need to be given to you and so we start at life anybody know this 2023 I got this I'm about to do this all I got to do is change my thinking and I am on my way excuse me excuse me okay hold on wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute no I got this I can change my heart because I don't even care no more you know what I mean I don't even care no more because this thing is about me I'm about to get my life right I'm about to get myself together my finance is about to be crazy it went okay hold on wait a minute and then you find out you can't change you but here's how crazy we are instead of why you're doing it and turning to God oh a friend hey can you come can you come here for a second and can you can you come up here real quick for me listen I've been going through and you know I've been trying to figure it out but I'm not really sure about how to how to really how to really get there what do you what do you think is the best way can you can you tell me which way help me help change my mind just a little bit if you can here you go yeah there we oh my gosh you didn't yeah yeah I'm dead man all right that's fine go back to you PT you're a man of God can you can you come can you help me real listen man this is this is this is how life goes you know this is this I I just need you to get me get me there and if you could if you could just help me because you know what I'm saying we tight like that and you know life so like if you can make that happen I appreciate you my man that's what I'm saying because he know he you you hey hey hey hey hey hey bro hey bro you you go have a seat bro [Applause] thank you time of death [Applause] and we keep inviting people into our lives and all the while they kill our faith they killed the seed that's been poured inside of us instead of us going to the thing that the very person the very creator of who we are we found ourselves in a place where we're trying to self-fix the things of life and we don't want to offer God all of us just some of us and we only want to do a little bit but not too much and we don't want to sacrifice and we don't want to hear anybody else because we had the answer and he says this there's a problem you need to be transformed and understanding my good and my pleasing and my perfect will he says you cannot do the will of the father without surrendering yourself to the father today and I just want to tell somebody stop being your own doctor in 2023 and get on board that God wants to do something in your life I don't know what to do about my finances but I know he says I need to be a giver so let me take this thing off and let me get my understanding under action I don't know anything and everything I do know comes from him so whatever it is God that you need to do in me change me make me change my mind help my heart help my mind because if I keep doing this I'll kill everything on the inside of me and you wonder why your potential won't rise somewhere it's supposed to be and you're wondering why you're fighting the Battle of Life of where it's supposed to be and you're trying to consume in your mind why you can't get over this home because you keep trying to fix you and God says all for yourself as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable and pleasing unto God and then he says this in order to do it your mind has to be transformed 2023 you can be as healthy as you want and financially free as you want but if you are not transformed and you are conformed to this world you will stay in the darkness of where you are but I got a couple of people that are interested in fulfilling their potential and are saying God use me whatever way you see fit I offer my life I offer my mind I offer my body whatever you want to do I am willing but I won't just tell your neighbor real quick I will not stay where I am oh [Applause] I won't stay where I am I won't stay in the state I won't stay in this arrogance that I know and I'll pull God in on consultation some of you have put God in the consultation seat and he is the creator of all things I want to live a life that is good pleasing and perfectly fulfilling his will and when I do that then from that I will see the fruit that I'm supposed to bear in my life but it needs to start somebody say now you've got to have a sense of urgency I don't feel like it it's not about how you feel it's all about your life is on the line can I even get crazy enough and tell you something I'm gonna tell somebody something it might get a little controversial but I'm gonna tell you this stop saying who you're doing it for you know I'm doing it for my kids God ain't actually do this for your kids you know I'm doing it for my family God didn't ask you to do this for your family God God said I created you the responsibility to fulfill your potential is not according to how many kids you have how big your family is how large things are when you fail at being who God called you to be it is not a letdown of your family it is a letdown of your creator if the result is the Brokenness of your family and the result is the Brokenness of your family but I'm here today to let you know you need to get intact for you not for somebody else not for somebody on the side not imma do it for Grandma mama mama I got you I'm missing that no they already where they need to be you need to get it together for you so that God can change you where you are because when your motivation is people you will lose it they will leave you they will go in a different direction they will upset you and now your full motivation is God but the Bible says something about he'll never leave you and he'll never forsake you he'll always be there even in the midst of trouble if I lose everything he's still there if I have everything he's still there he's the god it doesn't matter what happens and when it happens he is always Fair so my motivation is in him is the sign I did the sign that's the last week joke y'all don't y'all we might not the context is that what God is doing is bigger than what you could even imagine or think today God is saying there's greatness in store for you but the responsibility of it being fulfilled is not in God it's in you because he's done everything already to see that it would be manifested he's just waiting on somebody tell your neighbor he waiting on you ah tell him bro he's he's waiting on you [Music] he's waiting on you to get it for you he doesn't care how much you are supporting and pumping everybody else up God never called you to be a sideline cheerleader and not get in the game yourself [Music] some of y'all on the side like go go you can do it go and it's like well why you ain't in the game oh no you know I don't I don't play that position you know that's that's not what I do I'm just on the I'm the background no background God didn't make background Creations God didn't form background people God said when I formed you I saw you as a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for good works so today if we want to be selfish let's be selfish and say God I want everything that you have for me bless me indeed enlarge my territory enlarge my mind my thinking my ways and then let it Pour down let there be an overflow let the windows of Heaven open up and pour out a blessing that I don't even have room to receive and since I don't have room to receive it pour it out on my family pour it out on my children pour it out on my mother pour it out on my father pour it out on my community you can pour it in my block you can pour it in my ZIP code pour it out on my church pour it out on my pastor whatever it is you want to do [Music] wants you to pour it out
