[Music] and thank you for what you've done in this space welcome to the mix my name is Marcus England and I'm the lead Pastor here and I am so grateful so grateful that we have this moment together anybody ready for the word of God I'm going to Jump Right In we're in our Series in week three of the good life and I I think it's an opportunity for us to understand what our Prime scripture is if you can open your Bibles open your notes real quick we're going we're going to jump into the word of God there's something see I want to tell you this that connection matters because connection will help you understand as a follower of Jesus Christ for those that are following the importance of the blood of Jesus Christ if you've opened your Bible to the Old Testament you understand as you walk through Exodus and as you walk through Deuteronomy and as you walk through numbers and and you walk through this Torah the first five books of the Bible what you'll understand is how much blood sacrifice went into covering sins when you understand how much sacrifice it took to cover but then you understand the ultimate sacrifice of what it took to wash away when we understand the power of the blood we understand that every day I can walk in Victory in my imperfect moments of life because the Bible says that I am more than a conqueror if I understand scripture then I understand that every word of God somebody say it's true every word of God is true and so as we as we really go into week three I want to talk through the idea of what peace looks like in your life do you tell your neighbor real quick I need some peace come on anybody listen it didn't sound like you need it you sound like you were good right where you are can you tell somebody else on the other side I need some peace come on tell your church I say third choice I need peace anybody can say that today I need some peace listen you can pay me more but I need more with peace I don't know anymore headache I don't need more weight I need more somebody say peace John Pennington says this the thief comes only to steal [Music] and kill and destroy Jesus being the eye says I came [Music] that they may have life and habit somebody say abundantly I think it's important for you to understand we've already diagnosed that abundantly means Superior in quality I am to live the best life that Jesus offers me somebody say now not tomorrow not when he returns he's called for me to live the best life now [Music] so I don't want to wait he says how come that you might have life which means eternity but to have that life what more abundantly that means today so since we understand that God wants us to live the good life I want to talk about relationships today somebody say relationships Romans 12 18 says this if possible [Music] already knew some of our attitudes he already knew what some of us lie with people he he already knew the introverted people we're going to talk about staying away and the extroverted people will go on Gossip he says this if possible [Music] so far as it depends on who no no as far as it depends on who lives peaceably with somebody say oh some of y'all already shaking your head you said on the left side so you didn't have to sit on the right side you already knew you need to live peaceably somebody say with all I want to talk from this title today the good the bad the in between the good the bad the in between can we pray today Father in the name of Jesus help us not help our neighbor [Music] not help our spouse not help our children not help our boss not help everybody in my circle help me oh Lord for I am standing in the need prayer help my mind help my eyes to see I help my ears to hear your word today in Jesus name somebody say Amen come on help me celebrate our amazing worship team thank you so much and can you also help me celebrate our Dream Team every volunteer a part of your church help me celebrate them today I want to go back and and recap first of all I want to celebrate our overseer overseer Joyce that spoke on last week can y'all help me give it up for the word of God that's my mama oh wish she's my favorite all right let me get into the message Proverbs chapter 3 we talked about this because the scripture lets us know that God wants us to live a life that is full and abundant But A Life That's Fallen abundant does not come through salvation only it is the result of what Proverbs 3 and 1 and 2 says my son do not forget my teaching my precepts and my principles but keep my Commandments in your what heart somebody say heart it's important that you underline that because the word of God needs to be in your heart not just in your mind a word that is in your mind does not change your actions it is a word that is instilled in your heart he says for they will do what prolong your life many years and bring you somebody say peace and prosperity today we're going to talk through the lens of peace and it's important that we talk through that lens today because we understand long life peace and prosperity all intersect our lives so that we can live the Abundant Life that Jesus has called us to here's what we said the long life equals health that peace equals relationships and that Prosperity speaks to our finances our career and the material things of life let's leave that up there so that everyone understands that all of these areas matter together not only separate here's the reason why I want to get you on board with the together life because of together life means I cannot live in proportion to an abundant life but in a totality of abundant life I don't want to be great in my health but failing in my relationships I don't want to be great in my relationships but failing in my finances everything matters for me to live the Abundant Life that God has called for me to live but if I do not understand that all of my life must be in the hands of God I will surrender portions of my life and will only see blessings and pieces of who I am today I believe that God wants you to have peace just tell your neighbor real quick I need some peace man I listen in a world of confusion in a world where every system is failing in a world where everything that you look at is declaring that life no matter matters to you I want to tell you I need peace today and I believe this that peace is going to come out of the relationships you have can I tell you this you can have amazing health you can be financially set but when you are by yourself living out life you feel alone and you feel disconnected and there's nothing like a successful person with no one to share it with anybody ever been on vacation you ever been on vacation by yourself you've been like I need to do this this is healthy but on day three when you've talked to yourself for three days you start to say to yourself I need some people around me anybody ever been there before you you know life is going well you you understand things are connecting the right way but here's what you recognize is that I need relationships I don't need to do life alone I know you think you're killing the game I know you have passive income I know you understand how much life is succeeding but here's what I need you to know is that you're not called to do life alone you're called to do life in relationships here's the thing most of us have been in a relationship and we've been in some bad ones can I get an amen don't look beside you why did you look to the left don't look to the left or to the right some of us have been in relationships because we chose broken relationships because we were in broken places you choose according to your current Outlook you make decisions according to what you believe not just what you know you may know a lot but what you believe determines what you do you can tell somebody I believe this I believe that but the product of your life of where you are now is according to what you truly believe and trust so here's what I want to tell you about good relationships good relationships enhance Our Lives bad relationships teach us lessons neither should enable us I'm gonna repeat that again good relationships a good relationship does not make you who you are you are already purpose filled before you've connected with someone else you are enough where you are by yourself Let the Church Say Amen can I settle you there can I tell you that you are Enough by yourself [Applause] I got them golf claps and I appreciate y'all the rest of my church they're trying to consider Pastor I just got into this relationship We're not gonna mess this up for me were you whole before you got in to somebody else's life that may not be whole or you may not be whole my question today is to ask you good relationships somebody say enhance they do not make you let me say it again for the people in the back it's three rows back that's all that's as far as a good relationship does not make you that's why you can never tell anybody I would die without you no I wouldn't I'd be really sad I cry for a long time I find myself in a place where I don't may not know what I'm gonna do but one thing that I will not do is lose identity of who I am when someone walks away from me tell your neighbor real quick You Better Know Who You Are why is that important Pastor because a good relationship enhances let's talk about a good relationship a good relationship is something that is healthy that is not feeding off of you because of what it lacks only it is enhancing your life to give you something that you need good relationships are always not 50 50 but they contribute in the seasons that they're moving in your life you need healthy relationships to enhance somebody say enhance because where you are is not supposed to be where you stay there are relationships called to take you to the next place and season of your life they are called to enhance where you are going not to just keep you where you are good relationships enhance bad relations oh y'all know about them don't you a spirit rose up in you when I said a bad you immediately a picture came to you immediately you be you just got angry I can't God I thought I let it go I took communion I said I forgave but immediately when I said bad relationship you immediately drew a picture in your mind I can't stand them Jack my life up Nest me up the problem with that thinking is for the relationships that you have not healed from you are not learning the lesson that you're supposed to get what you will do is find yourself in position where you will be angry yet you will still desire what broke you [Applause] we have some unhealthy relationships that position Us in life as followers of Jesus Christ and Kingdom movers that God has called for you to take assessment of but not to sow seed into your heart and because many of us have allowed the seed of disgruntleness of unkindness and unforgiveness in our life it's taken rude and grown fruit instead of teaching you the lesson so that when you moved on you didn't duplicate the bad relationship with the new face you moved on to something better here is the idea is that neither one of them are called to you forever a good relationship it's not called to stop you in your life from purpose and you give everything to this one space in life now you've lost your identity and the bad relationship isn't called to you because it didn't work out because you put everything into it you need to learn the lesson so let's talk about what the foundation and the building blocks are the first foundation and building block that you've got to understand is about you living Abundant Life this is from somebody say a kingdom perspective because what you're going to initially think is Pastor I tried that it don't work I'm trying to tell you I was not the problem they were the problem I will tell you that my therapist told me that and I just want to let you know I'm on the right side my therapist told you first of all your therapist is not God second of all they're there to help you move in your life but they're not there to be your life so stop claiming your therapist as your God because sometimes God requires you to do things that don't seem logical to the human mind the Bible says his ways are not our ways and his thoughts so if you know that and God could possibly choose something different for you why do you avoid him when it's time to receive the answer of what to do the reason I avoid God is because he might force me he might force me to do something that's going to require me to come out of me and to do something that would require me to trust him because I'm not strong in that area enough to do it by myself that's why the Bible says in my weakness his strength is made what perfect so I understand there are weak points that what teach me a lesson so that I can become all that God has called for me to be but in order to live a Peaceable life the Bible lets me know that I'm called to live out his Commandments how are we going to list that all together Pastor we're going to Mush it all together because Abundant Living comes from obedience and understanding what God wants to do in your life and making sure that your alignment matches up with God's alignment and that you don't walk in your own ways but in all thy ways you do what acknowledge Him expecting him to direct your path every time if you get into a session and the moment the only conversation you have is about what you feel and what you think you have lost and understanding of the Kingdom principle The Kingdom principle says I am more interested in what God thinks and what God feels before I take an audience with everyone else to see and get their opinion some of us stay in a survey about our lives instead of going before the throne of grace real quick I just want to pass a survey out to five friends that I got let me know is this relationship good or do you see bad things happening and here's what we do we put Christians in our lives but not believers we put emotional broken non-abundant living [Music] fearful non-healed people into our decision-making process instead of yielding ourselves to what God has to say because I promise you what God has to say about you is about building you it's not about changing others see real quick you think you're good like you I did the work pastor and what I won't do is go back you might have left something behind because the Bible understands that what we're doing are going from glory to glory we're learning more and more about who we are I understand that you haven't messed up in a long time but here's what I want to let you know you've identified your outward sins that everyone publicizes as being broken but you haven't identified you're inward sins which is the pride and the arrogance and it is the anger that has led you to sin that you have not been able to be able to be objective about because you found yourself at the place where you're okay with making sure you don't do the outward things that people can recognize but you live in the inward parts of where you are we need that healing from God [Applause] so the First Foundation that we've got to live on is the foundation of somebody say love I'm not talking about your lovey-dovey feelings I'm not talking about when your heart just begins to shape it a little way you begin to oh my god when you first saw him when you first saw her where your heart just was like oh my God this is this is a man oh my God you you just oh every time I look at them I can't stop we gonna FaceTime until the phone dies we gonna make sure we text each other all night I I can't stop looking at you you can't stop looking at me I gotta go study but I just can't imagine life without you today I'm not talking about that kind of love I'm talking about the kind of love that you make a decision not the kind of love that you feel because the love that you feel will weigh in and out every moment of your life it will shape you it will take you it will move you today you will lose your mind tomorrow you'll Act Right the next day I'm not talking about a love that varies I am talking about a love that is consistent love Romans says in Romans 12 and 9 love from the center of Who You Are don't what pause right there love from the center of who you are don't fake it anybody know how to how to fake their love how do you fake a love you create actions that please others to personify that there is something there that you feel and want to be you know what love is can I cannot can I talk about love a little bit it's the rest of the scripture says run for dear life from evil hold on for dear life to good be good friends who loved deeply [Music] practice playing second fiddle Pastor you gonna open that up I'm gonna open that up can I open it up can I open it up real quick let me just open it up let me help you real quick so so we're going to talk about this love that loves from the center which means it is a choice of love that I am making that what you and I have will not be dependent on how you feel tomorrow it will be somebody say a decision I need to make a decision that I'm going to love that's what Jesus did on the cross he made a decision not my will thy will what be done I'm making a decision to go to Calvary for you because even in the midst of knowing you're gonna act a fool when you get here on this Earth and I'm going to still die for you that's love that's what John 3 16 says for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever however crazy you are however repetitive in your mess you are however chaotic your mind thinks that whoever would believe in him shall not perish but have what eternal life so he says I want you to be good friends can I start at that point every person that you meet of the opposite sex is not supposed to be your mate can I get an amen my God let me share a wife because as followers of Jesus Christ we are supposed to have brothers and sisters in Christ that are supposed to be a part of our life but the only thing we see is a possibility of dating every human being that looks like they looked at us they didn't even look at you you know how I'm talking about every time she keeps sitting near me she got there first [Music] [Applause] he keep cutting the eye at me that's cause you keep coughing without covering your mouth but every relationship in your life is not supposed to be the one the reason we're so bad at relationships from an intimacy level is because we're bad at friendships we don't have building blocks to build upon because everything we rush into is about us being together I don't know you I don't know what you like I don't know your temperament I don't know how to deal with you when you get mad so every relationship is dependent upon you being able to meet the needs of what I need in the mate instead of meeting the needs of what I need in a brother or sister so you don't know how to be a friend because you looking to hook up with everything that looks like it's halfway living no you do not know how to hold a conversation because you never sat at a table without looking on the other side of it to see what you can get from it [Music] every time y'all go out you trying to figure out I'll make this plan work so we can get together instead of saying I don't have anything to get from this relationship so there's no pressure that's why y'all want to sit in church together you walk on one side they walk on the other side you're dating listen fellas Every Woman does not want to date you because she said hello some of them are just on the Dream Team I make them say hello you know every Sunday she keep talking to me come on tell your neighbor real quick calm down my God calm down because you think out of your emotions you don't have Clarity of thought to see red flags and red flags May mean or indicate this is someone God has called for you to help not to date y'all want to hear this conversation because everybody trying to fall in love let's pump the brakes can I really dig a little bit more just a hair real quick those of us that are around that 30 35 40 that's all you're looking for because you don't even want to make new friends you locked all your friendships are locked think about this every person you know that's your best friend you've known them for about 20 years 10 years you don't talk to nobody what's up yeah I'm good you ever heard somebody say I got all the friends I need how you know can I tell you Jesus was 30 and got 12 new homies some of the relationships in your life are supposed to be built on a genuine love instead of in anticipation about what it could do for you when you love you walk into a relationship saying what can I offer not what can I get how many of you are walking and connecting with people and meeting them and saying God what do you want me to do not what do you want me to get he told Abraham I will bless you so that you can be a what blessing you can only be a blessing if you're looking to meet a need most of us are figuring from our lack what can I get it gonna pay me you think you think he can get me a job no no no the idea is figure out why God put the relationship in your life and when it's in your life don't fake it be genuine stop trying to sell your life to people who don't want to buy it just be real and new I got it together on Mondays but not so good on Tuesdays this is who I am God is working on me because his kingdom is transforming me as Romans chapter 12 verse 2 says being not conformed to the pattern of the world but being transformed by the renewing of your mind I'm looking for imperfect people to do life with so you don't have to keep masquerading so when you do fall you don't have to go into isolation because you never told me that you were imperfect so now you're scared to come out and talk to me because we don't have genuine relationship if we had genuine relationship you could have called me when you fell or right before you fell and I could have been there with you in the moments of me but instead of having a genuine relationship you created a picture so that I would think more about you than you even think about yourself now you have no peace because every time we come together you're trying to masquerade as something that you're not so you're Faking It instead of being genuine and allowing me to love you where you are Let Me Love You Where You Are not where you want to be I need to know you got a bad attitude so when I call you I'm not surprised or I don't quit that's why y'all quitting everybody that's why you tell online people I'm a preach to y'all that's why you telling everybody I ain't got no time for this because you don't understand the power of relationships you're called to love somebody say love means good and bad some of you wake up every morning with anxiety because you're fulfilling someone's idea of who you should be instead of walking through the process of God creating you and taking you through the moments of who you will become you dressed apart you talked apart you get the hair that looks the part but inside you are drowning and broke you need to tell somebody who loves you my marriage is broke and I need you instead you work it out within yourself because you don't even have the skill set or the ability or the tools to work it out so you personify Perfection constantly which is burning you out your relationships your marriage your children you got them on Perfection goals that you could never accomplish that's why there's a tension between y'all because you want them to do something you ain't done you know you shouldn't go moving in with nobody I saw you moving in with somebody how you gonna tell me instead of saying I did it in a broken manner here's how I messed it up instead of saying out of love this is why I'm where I am honestly [Applause] we're Faking It and we're requiring everyone else around us to be something we aren't when we do that then we have the second building block that we don't oftentimes share which is Grace you have no Grace for anybody everybody is living on some pedestal that you don't even have the ability to reach and every time someone makes a mistake you on them like hot glue Won't Give Up won't let up won't make an opportunity for them to be able to say I'm sorry some people want to apologize in your presence but you have not even made space [Applause] some of you I want to tell you I messed up but I'm really fearful of the repercussions [Music] I'm really scared that you are not going to share my same sentiment of thoughts when it's time for me to find myself at a place of being vulnerable I don't need a solution right now I just need somebody to hear me but you only do that when you have what Grace action neighbor real quick you got any Grace no because if they look at you and be like well you know because the Bible says I'm glad you know what the Bible says how about you do what the Bible does because if you had Grace you would forgive much quicker if you had Grace you will already know through the friendship that there's a possibility that this could be a weak area and instead of accusing me every time you could help me live it out in a gracious way the scripture says in Matthew chapter 5 verse 7 those who sow loving kindness are what happy because they will have loving kindness shown to them what you give is what you what receive if I can forgive well guess what I'm forgiven well I'm trying to tell you today what you need to receive in your life is so important because if you don't have Grace just tell your neighbor real quick have a little Grace anybody just need a little Grace this morning it was raining he was coming in he was like I'm Gonna Come boy I don't feel like it today what if God was like oh oh that's how you feel that's how you feel don't call he's just like like you're gonna freeze me right here like I'm not gonna don't come God is so God is so gracious with us yes so much love and kindness and we are so strict like we got it together it's you you ain't all that I know your degree I I know the things that are built in your life make you believe it but we need Grace anybody in here can just use some Grace sometimes anybody here could just use the you know what let's do it let's let's take a fresh start let's do it again anybody can use somebody around them that when you got mad they just be like man you tripping and they could just walk anybody needs somebody like that you're just stripping today it's all right I'ma call you tomorrow [Applause] people in my life like you won't because I didn't get it right today I saw a pastor I think he said a word I ain't going to that church no more I won't do it I know that's how he is I won't do it now do you understand the grace culture is the kingdom culture the canceled culture is the world's culture when we cancel people we have nothing to do with the grace of God but what the grace of God says as I see you where you are but I know that's not where you'll stay I see what you're going through but I know that's not the end of it for you I see greater this is what Jesus told Peter right before he's going into the garden he said to Peter in Luke 22 32 Simon it's the same as Peter Simon Peter praying for you in particular that you not give in or give out when you have come through the time of testing some of you are in the time of testing when you get through it turn to your companions and give them a fresh start some of you have cut some people off y'all had that New Year's Eve message you got some haters in your life and when those haters come in your life you need to cut those haters off nobody was hating on you I just messed up you were supposed to show them so what Grace now you ain't got nobody in your phone you ain't got nobody to call cause you don't cut off all of your haters they forgot to teach you Grace but Grace does not come without Point number three and that's the truth yeah I need some real people y'all ever heard them say I need some real ones I need some I need some y'all I need some real ones [Music] show me the grace but don't be over here lying to me either you get what I'm saying like hold me accountable because I don't wanna hey where I am I don't want to be here forever hold me accountable stop saying everything I want to hear y'all like that you're like I don't know I don't need that Pastor I need some people you need Grace with truth [Music] Proverbs 24 and 26 says this an honest answer is a sign of true friendship tell me can I get real practical tell me something's in my beard y'all like that's small no that's real you gonna sit there and talk to me for 20 minutes knowing I'm jacked up knowing [Music] I messed up knowing and here's how we keep people from telling us the truth we put on the angry face with the angry attitude you better not say nothing all right but the Bible says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free two sides to it tell me the truth but be available [Music] for somebody to tell you the truth [Music] because I don't want to tell the truth to someone that's always biting my head off it's the truth it's an opportunity it's a moment to say what is God really saying in my life so spouses can I say this last portion to you how you say Your Truth matters stop saying this very arrogant and prideful well I just gonna say what I'ma say and I ain't gonna hold back because that's just who I am you're rude you don't have the fruit of the spirit love joy peace kindness faithfulness and self-control stop saying you're a real one because you want to tell everybody else about themselves but you don't want to see anything about you you a real one when you can give it and take it [Applause] [Music] I want the truth you're not you're not you're not giving a you're not giving 100 today I tell my team well Pastor what's Excellence me being able to tell you the truth you didn't come prepared today you didn't do your part you came in with an idea that you were better so in this truth let's have some Grace what's going on in your life that's keeping you from reaching the Abundant Life that God has for you I prayed today that in every relationship there will be love that there would be grace and that there would be truth
