[Music] i don't want you to take for granted the moments that god has given us but what i want you to do is have this opportunity in this moment to understand is that god wants to do something in you god wants to do something through you and god wants to do something for you and i believe this today by the power of jesus name that there are chains that are falling there are fear that is bowing in the name of jesus and what i believe today is that what god wants to do in you is to make you a brand new but i need somebody in this place to recognize that whatever the hole that the enemy tries to have over our life that he is not going to release it unless we are serious about there being a movement and a change a change not just for ourself but a change for our children and our children's children and i'm here today to let you know is that if you understood what your praise was worth you would value that thing just a little bit more you would take the moment an opportunity to give thanks to the king of kings and the lord o o give thanks unto the lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever [Music] now real quick if you're in expectation for god to do something right where you are can you just begin to lift your hands right now and just begin to give god a praise god i'm thanking you in advance for what you're doing right now i'm thinking that you're moving already i'm thanking you that fear is bowing that chains are being broken right now i will not walk out the same way i came in but i believe today by the power of your spirit oh god that i am being free in the name of jesus it's not by what it looks like and it's not by what it feels like but i am declaring it today in the name of jesus that i shall walk in freedom for we love you we honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody worship god for what's already being done [Music] amen amen [Music] real quick as you take your seat just tell somebody around you i'm so glad you're here today just turn to somebody else on the other side say i'm so glad you're here today can you turn to your third choice and say third choice i'm so glad you're here today come on we're excited we're excited about all that is god is doing here in this place welcome to the mix my name is marcus england i'm the lead pastor here of this church and i am grateful for all that god is doing and moving to do in this place i pray today that you have been blessed thus far by our worship team i pray that your heart is being opened even further to the things that god wants to do and i am grateful today and i am excited listen i want you to get out your notes i want you to get out your bibles we're going to be reading we're going to be writing we're going to be believing god that he has a word for us today here in the mix we say note takers or what and readers are what leader so let's do something today let's dive into god's word i believe opening these letters opening these testimonies are going to be huge as we're moving into week three of our series the movement the movement the movement and i believe god has a word acts chapter two let's jump into it what's happening in acts chapter two the holy spirit has come upon the apostles god is moving he is the beginning of the church it is not called the church it hasn't even been named christianity yet it's just a movement somebody say a movement it's a movement that is starting through the eleven and now in acts one has been added the twelve disciples to begin to get this word the testimony that jesus christ of nazareth is risen from the grave and the bible lets us know that as they are at this place he tells them to wait in jerusalem for they are part of a festival he says i want to let you know if you wait the holy spirit is coming he says i i want to let you know there's something that is going to be activated somebody say activated in your life that will give you what you need to be able to move according to the purpose and the plan that god has established over your life the bible lets us know that as the apostles begin to move they begin to get this word and they begin to talk about the testimony for there is no bible there is no new testament this is the beginning of the church but they have a testimony and in this testimony is the clarity that jesus the messiah has risen from the grave as peter begins to shout this story this testimony to many the bible lets us know that over 3 000 were saved that day and the bible says once they got saved they did not just stay at salvation they moved to the next step somebody say the next step they took the next step and god said i want to do something more than just save you but i want to fill you with the holy spirit and he said this holy spirit will be edited by the speaking of tongues i will identify in you that i have set my spirit inside of you the bible lets us know once that happened there was a group that came together and that were saved immediately and the bible picks up to say what happened after this salvation and the filling of the holy spirit in acts chapter 2 verse 42 it says this and they devoted themselves [Music] to the apostles teaching and the fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers and the bible says and all came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles [Music] and all who believed were somebody say together all who believed were together your salvation was never meant for you to do it in isolation it was meant for you to do it somebody say this word again together we were meant to do it together and it said and had all things in common but the bible takes it a step further it takes it a step further than just showing up on sundays than just being together it says and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need that's the first church that's the movement it was not self-motivation with success that was about me growing minds and minds only it was about seeing the need around here's what it established it established a group of people who were looking for the needs of others i'm just searching around to see if there's anybody in me because if there's anybody in need i want to be a blessing i'm searching around to see if there's anybody that has fallen by the wayside because we are all believers and we all have the same father in heaven and we all are on one accord together i look for the need if you have a need let me know why because we are all together in this it says we're all together and they're selling their possessions and belongings and distributing to all as any hackney and says and day by day somebody say day by day they say sunday by sunday y'all it said day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes some of y'all like i come to church twice a week i can't do it it's too many sundays in a row they were there day by day breaking bread in their homes they received their food with glad and generous hearts praising god and having favor with all people and the lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved i want to come from the topic today saved to serve saved to serve let's pray father in the name of jesus we thank you so much for this moment that you've given us we thank you for this opportunity that we have to be in your presence i pray that this seed not fall on rocky ground stony ground that did not get caught in the thorns but god that it would fall on good soil today let our hearts be open to hear and receive your word for we love you honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much y'all can y'all help me give it up for those who serve here that's a part of our dream team can y'all help me celebrate them real quick y'all you saw him coming in you saw him outside you saw him in the kids area they are serving because they have been saved to serve i believe this today that we're called to serve we're called to give of ourselves to something greater that is not of us many times what i'm believing and learning is that in this life we are often believing that our only focus point at times can be the focus that we are called to be successful that we're called to have it all together that we are called to be the picture of perfection but if many of us could be honest is that in life we find ourselves making mistakes jacking it up as we go along and asking for an opportunity to be better at what we've given the opportunity to be able to do i don't know if you've been like me but i have taken on life and life has hit me and i thought i had it all together but life has shown me many times that i did not have it together as much as i thought i did if you learn life life will try to throw into the process this idea that our pride how others see us the way we look to people is more important than the truth that god has to give us through the word for the bible lets us know that if we know the truth that truth shall somebody say free the bible lets us know that there is freedom in truth but often times truth is hard to hear because truth will require you to look at yourself and truth will also require you to change yourself in a way that isn't always initially beneficial to the extended vision that you had for your life can i tell you today that i had a vision of where i was gonna be where i was gonna be how i was gonna be and when i was gonna be it can i tell you the idea in my mind that the way that god was going to use me the way that i would be profoundly used by the lord would be in the circumference of the way that i wanted him to do it when i wanted him to do it and how i wanted him to do it the problem is is that he may not cut when you want them but he's what always on time we like that saying we don't like that process [Applause] because the context to it is is that we're giving god the liberty to come at the right time but the right time isn't always the urgent time because there's some things that i need god to do and see my urgency on that i need him to acquit and fast if he doesn't act quick and fast then sometimes what i do is put him into the place where i say god i'll give you a rest and i'll take it over again anytime we take back over the things that we've laid before god we find ourselves picking up sacrifices that we should have laid down to him that we ourselves have never had the ability to be able to solve but yet in some way we've convinced ourselves again that we have the ability to do it on our own today i want to let you know that you have the opportunity today to stop right in your tracks and to say to yourself some truth self you can't do this without god i think we need to come to a realization that we can get a little ways but we are definitely not where god has called for us to be there are some things that are in the inside of us potential that is ready to grow but without god we cannot establish who he has called for us to be yeah you know how to work yeah you're really good with the computer yeah you got some people that want what you have but i'm here today to let you know you are only tapping in into the smallest version of your potential if you could possibly hook up with the one who created you who established you who put your mind into the right place and put your feet on a firm foundation i believe today you could establish something that you've never seen before the bible is letting us know that there are 12 young men really 11 but one is added at the end to replace judas iscariot that have come into a place that by themselves they are unlearned men they don't really know what life is all about they don't have it all together they understand that they're zealous because what happens at a young age is we're highly zealous but we lack wisdom we lack wisdom and the information to truly become who god's called for us to be the bible says in discipleship that jesus keeps them for about three years and he pours into them he speaks into the men and they understand some and they don't understand always but they get into a place when jesus is crucified they go into hiding in fear because they think the same is going to happen to them the bible lets us know though that they are not looking for a risen savior they are sitting in the room wearing out of their selves of fear that someone is after them but there was a testimony there was a testimony by a woman that established a a sense of hope that god was doing something miraculous in the world through his son jesus christ and the bible lets us know that a woman came back and said you've got to see where the body of our lord is he is no longer in the grave he is risen that testimony sparked the sense of hope and that hope came back to make something new and brand new the bible says they ran to the grave to see his body but i'm here today to let you know he is risen and you cannot find him you can go into israel but you won't find his body because i'll save your life just tell your neighbor real quick he lives come on tell somebody else on the other side he lives if he lives it means that i have something to look forward to it means that the hope that's with inside of me is a hope that goes beyond my understanding it is no longer a logical hope it is no longer just a literary hope it is a hope of things to be seen it means i must activate the faith inside of me to believe that god is doing something why because he's already sent his son to establish a firm foundation that i am his and he is mine [Applause] i believe that today and we established that today as the basis of our foundation because if we don't believe in the resurrected christ then what we will do is waver in our salvation and we won't look for the next step of what god is to do within us we will wait for god to do for us instead of us waiting for god to do something in us the establishment of why these men were able to take a gospel around the world that over two thousand years later it's still being preached and established is not because of how great they were it was established because of the greatness of the god that was inside of them i want to let you know today is that if the holy spirit could be inside of you you could see yourself and your life change the very dynamic of your community the very dynamic of your family the very dynamic of this world you would not just be someone who was living day to day waking up for work and going back to bed you would be someone who is identified as i have a purpose and that purpose is established on the inside of me and the way that i'm moving today is intentional honey no i don't have time to go out with you today why because there's something about my purpose that needs to be sewn into and i understand the way that god is going to use me is in such a way that it's going to blow your mind so what you need to do is give me the opportunity to become who god wants me to be because when i become who god wants me to be i'm going to blow your mind and bless you at the same time [Applause] you don't understand that you're hindering the process of what god wants to do yet also you're hindering your blessing when you hold people back from the things that god wants to establish in their life and you keep them for what being able to fulfill the potential of what god is spoken your blessings are in some of the people that you're holding back if you could understand that they are around you to bless you instead of being around you to entertain you i'm not here just to be your friend i'm here to establish a sense of foundation in your life because god has put me on this earth to do something that nobody else could do and if you understood what he established and created me to do you would be on top of me telling me you better get in your word today because your deliverance is my deliverance and your blessing is my blessing and your breakthrough is my breakthrough you put me here for a reason so it's important that the people around you be established because there's something they're supposed to add to your life not take away [Applause] [Music] when you get 12 homies around you [Music] you got to be on them and what you doing today man i'm chilling we ain't got time to chill y'all let me let me let me tell you real quick let me establish why this is so important because if you understood how important the surrounding that you have in your life is you will pressure the people that are around you to become everything that god has called for them to be because they're in your life to establish a blessing that god already has over their life and you're in their life to establish a blessing that god has over their life and if we join together where the bible says two or three are gathering together touching and agreeing do you know what we could conquer as a unit together and not by ourselves it could be something that would blow our minds but the fact of the matter is that i don't value what god has put inside of you enough to establish some confidence in you to say you better get it together because if you don't get it together i can't get it together because i'm depending on you and you depending on me and i can't go backwards so man up woman out and get your life right because my freedom is on the line if you're tempted and i don't have any accountability where am i going [Applause] what we're establishing is how important your salvation your circle and the purpose of what god has placed inside of you what it means to your growth and your further movement as a man and woman of god if we don't establish it then your salvation is enough and your salvation alone cannot get you to the purpose that god has established it can get you in the pathway to heaven but here's what's going to happen you're going to have jesus and you're going to stay the same [Applause] the scripture says in psalms 92 13. it says those who are planted somebody say planted it says those who are planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god there's an establishment of what god is doing in your life as long as you're doing something in his house [Music] god says you focus on my house i'll focus on yours we've taken the mindset the more i focus on minds then i'll get to his god said no no no you understand the pathway i set for you what i've called you to do and flourish how i've called you to move and be established if you establish that i'll bless you [Applause] he says i'll flourish some of us are working so hard to flourish because we're outside the will of god [Music] god says what's more important how do you how you flourish it some of you i'm gonna tell y'all we got folk that's been serving that don't even know why they're so blessed eg listen pastor i pastor i bought this house this is a testimony pass i bought this house i don't know how i got it i don't know i don't know what i don't i don't know why this person came and introduced me to this person and i got that job off of that person being introduced and god says i told you if you take care of my house i'll take care of yours for those who are planted in the house of the lord shall flourish y'all thought i like church i just like the word of god why you here all the time pastor cause he keeps blessing me [Applause] why are you worshiping i'm planted what you doing i'm right on the front row why you worship so hard he just told me real quick david said it i'm gonna go with david because the bible lets me know david and god were pretty close so i'm gonna go with somebody who was pretty close to the lord and he said hey listen if you plant yourself in the things of god he'll flourish you some people don't understand why you're doing so well in a short amount of time when it's taken them all of their life to get to where they are [Music] [Applause] how you do that i don't know [Music] i just i just i just kept with god [Applause] well how are those doors opening for you i don't know i just i just pointed myself in the things of god how where did you get that deal from i don't know i just planted myself in the things of god tell your neighbor real quick you got to get planted you're too loose you're all over the place you don't know where you're going you don't know what you're doing from sunday to sunday you're trying to book brunch and brush still got you looking sad sunday afternoon when you didn't come to church when you weren't apart and you're trying to figure out what the problem is it's because you haven't established yourself in the house of the lord that's right when you play it yourself bible lets us know in psalms 16 11 it says you will show me the path of life that's why you're always so happy because i got king jesus and i don't need nobody else [Music] [Applause] some of y'all like we in church stop laughing pastor this is serious business it says you will show me the path of life he says in your presence somebody say in his presence is fullness of joy sometimes i just come to church because i'm just a little messed up and i need some joy in your presence it's fullness of joy and at your right hand of pleasures forevermore i want to establish something real quick and i want to run you through it i want to run you through this process because many of you have forfeited the blessings that god has established over your life because you haven't walked through the pathway of life that he has made for you and you've taken your own pathway you built your own record you built your own book and i'm just here today to let you know it's time for you to start following jesus how about you just get on his pathway just tell your neighbor real quick won't you try it the bible speaks this in ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 18. can you can we run through this real quick y'all i'm trying to teach you this morning i want y'all to go as far as you go the bible says this as paul is writing to a church in ephesus paul is an apostle apostles established churches churches now establish how paul pastors them is that he writes letters these are letters of information these are letters of doctrine these are also letters to be able to help them know that he's establishing new leaders and these leaders will be coming those in whom he is pouring into will be coming to be pastors over those churches as paul is writing this letter he says this he says i keep asking that the god of our lord jesus christ the glorious father may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened that you may know the hope somebody say hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people pastor what that mean let's break it down real quick point one the scripture says i want you to know him better can i tell you it's time to get closer to god can i just put that out there as your pastor you've done really well at church you've done really well at growing up in church you've done really well and attending and being a part and volunteering because it it feels good but this is not the definition of relationship the definition of relationship is coming to know jesus more and more it is first understanding through salvation that he is the resurrected god it is coming through that salvation to understand that in his resurrection he left us a gift somebody say a gift i like gifts what did he leave me he left me the gift of the holy spirit the bible says through our salvation we are baptized in his name because we understand it is symbolic i was praying on symbolisms and did i believe him baptism is a symbolism of a old you going into the new gray into a grave and a new you coming out to be manifested into whom god has called for you to be the problem is is that i'm so used to the old me that i'm scared that the new me gonna be boring y'all thought that i know that's what you're thinking if i go to jesus all my fun is gone that's what it looked like why because you came to church and we was like let's just rejoice in the lord and the person besides you looks like they're two minutes from saying something to you that you don't like and you're trying to figure out are church people nice do they have any joy just tell your neighbor real quick i'm nice turn back to that neighbor and say i couldn't tell no i'm just playing don't do that don't do that i don't i don't want you to get into an issue with nobody but close relationship with god is not sunday sunday is the byproduct i come in his presence to be rejuvenated and renewed and to be together on one accord and one mindset i've come to be open my heart to be open and to worship god and to have an opportunity but what i am telling you is you were made to live in joy you were not made to live in anger bitterness unforgiveness is the root of the loss of joy some of us are so brokenhearted that we've never had the opportunity to receive the healing that god has for us so today i want to offer a relationship for you to get closer to god so that you don't stay where you are this idea of closer relationship is about intimacy it is not about proximity [Music] matthew chapter 7 verse 21-23 it says this not everyone [Music] who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will somebody say the will the will of my father who is in heaven many will say to me on that day lord lord did we not prophesy people love the gift part of what they do then we not prophesy in your name and in your name drop out demons and in your name perform many miracles and the bible says this he's just gonna return back like you did something but it says then [Music] i will tell them plainly somebody say plainly this is basically the uh the old version of i'll keep it 100 no cat no cat i never knew you you ever been out with somebody somewhere and it's somebody you don't want to see and they stop calling your name that's the marcus oh no no no way no way i start searching for air bugs and i'm trying to hit i get on the phone real quick hello hello hello he's like i never knew you you you would feel some kind of way if i saw you and i didn't speak to you you would feel some kind of way if i if i was talking to you and and i met you out in the lobby and then when i saw you and if i can recognize you you know cause the lights are burning me right now but if i knew who you were and i looked at you and didn't speak you'd be like man that's messed up he didn't even speak to me he act like what he even know me jesus says this you can do a ton in my name but it does not mean i know you he said plainly 100. lord i was at every service i gave time offering everything he said listen i'm here to let you know i did not come in your life for what you could do for me i came in your life for what i could do for you [Applause] i came so that you could have life more abundantly it's time to get closer to god point two it's time to get honest with a friend can we park which is right there anybody know honesty is hard [Music] because you want to present yourself in the best possible way all the time can we be can we be honest with it i got it together how many of you somebody asked you today how you doing you said i'm good but she wasn't good how many of us have an issue with being honest because it means i've got to be vulnerable or i've got to put down my pride or my ego how's it going today you ever had somebody that's real honest they're a friend they're a little too honest y'all ever been there like okay some stuff you do need to keep secret but the idea when we read acts chapter 2 it says they all came together and they ate together and they were a part of the apostles teaching together because there's something about isolation that god knows when you're isolated the enemy tries to take advantage of you and there's something about being honest to people you can see because we'll be honest to god all day [Music] some of your prayer time lord i promise you i love you but i was going smack i'll put hands on her god if you don't help i promise you my hands are lethal i am not anybody tell god you're not fully changed like he don't know because i ain't changed all the way yet and i will i said what the world here's the thing being honest to god is great for he can forgive you of your sins but being honest to people is hard because honesty to people means accountability the bible says in james 5 and 16 pass to prove it i will therefore it says confess your sins to who therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed confess it to each other oh now let's go back that's why your circle means so much because if you cannot be truthful and in your truthfulness allow god to change where you are because you have someone who is now accountable to where you are and they're willing to pray for how many friends do you have that will pray for you [Applause] no for real like who you got when it's about to go down who you got pray girl what you mean pray i need you pray for me you need somebody that know jesus because as you draw closer to him you're at a point now where you're saying okay i get it i need to be honest with some people around me and not celebrate my brokenness that's right because i will cuss you out okay let's first of all get you got anger issues and where the bible says the fruit of the spirit is self-control you lack self-control let's stop promoting and celebrating because it means the fruit is not coming off of the branch that means the branch is not tied into the vine and who is the vine jesus christ stop promoting what you think other people want to hear because you don't have scripture context that says when you don't bear fruit it is a decide it's a sign that there's brokenness so you need to get healing that's why we have groups that come up on september the 11th you need people to do life with pastor i don't want people knowing all my business here's what i want to tell you that settled my heart about people knowing my business you are unique but your problems ain't [Applause] my kid's acting up so are yours so now we got something to talk about instead of me suffering in silence and thinking that god isn't with us god said i'm here i'm with you the problem is is you don't have community to help you get to the next level because you think prayer is about us talking to god and then him solving everything but you don't understand ephesians 2 and 10 that says we're god's masterpiece created in christ jesus to do what good works i don't see you as a good work partner because i have not looked at you as having being what a masterpiece so when i see you i see you as a complaint person but i don't see you as a truth giver some of us are in people's lives pacifying them and they can't get to their potential because they don't have accountability i'ma be honest with you i need this gym in my spirit but the problem is is that oftentimes anybody know you're trying to do something alone and you need somebody to say you're going today don't you mind your business you said you want to be free i know but you ain't got to be always in my business but did you go no are you going now it's a problem we don't have anybody asking us have you been seeking god today don't get all in my business do you know what god is saying for you your wife your family your home your children no i don't really know then when you're gonna do it i'll get to it why not now i don't know see here's the problem you don't have accountability [Applause] where you at what you doing who got you who's speaking into you who talking to you that's where pride and ego rise up because we think we're good enough without anyone else and genesis already gave us clarity it is not good that man be alone it was not just talking about marriage you need people write that down i need people [Applause] point number three i have four points for those of you i don't wanna i don't wanna mess with y'all i know how y'all okay here on third point why the keyboard player not out what's going on i've got four points today somebody say four points all right calm down changing it up like that what is wrong with him point three it's time to discover my real purpose in life [Music] you can have a lot of occupations you can even have a lot of passions but there is only one purpose that god has and that's the purpose that he declared for your life before he even formed you in your mother's womb you already came programmed the problem is sin has deprogrammed you [Music] into the brokenness of this world and you're like i'm good so let's talk about it i'm good you're not good well wait till i get the money i'm going to be good no you won't wait till i have the car i'll be straight no you won't wait till i get the house with the rooms i'm gonna be all together no you won't wait till i get my boo no you won't now you're gonna really need prayer [Applause] y'all you're driving me crazy lord you messed up my order it's time for you to discover say i have purpose didn't tell your neighbor you have purpose say it again i have purpose didn't tell your neighbor you have purpose you got to recognize you have purpose not just a job purpose a reason god created you a reason god formed you he did not form you because he needed another administrator he did not form you because he needed another doctor he did not form you because he needed another nurse psychiatrist or anything else we good i'm letting you know he formed you because he has a purpose for your life the question is are you doing what you're supposed to do to understand the revelation of who god's created you to be or have you settled for bmw a three-bedroom and a bank account that's not in the negative is that is the whole intent of how god has established your life can i tell you god can do better than that [Applause] romans 12 and 6 says this we have different somebody say gifts according to the grace given to each other of us i want to let you know today you need to stop comparing your gift isn't my gift my gift isn't your gift we don't have to compare gifts we just need to be in one accord all together i'm gonna do something real quick i just want you to tell somebody beside you real quick i need you to find your purpose tell somebody else on the other side i need you to find your purpose tell your third choice third choice i know you're my third choice i need you to find your purpose y'all understand what i'm like i need you to when you don't find your purpose i don't get to experience what god intended it's average people get to me like pastor why are you so hard on everybody because you're not hard enough on yourself [Applause] i heard the saying that said we real good at meeting everybody else's standards except ours they tell you coming to work you in there they tell you over time you in there they tell you got to be down here at a certain time you there you tell yourself i'm gonna be on time y'all in the argument well i don't know depends on how i feel today depends on where we are in compromise with our purpose while we help others fulfill theirs [Applause] can i tell you at t is killing it but you're going home without joy can i tell you comcast is wearing it out but you're going home miserable and depressed can i can i tell you johns hopkins is making it happen but you're whole trying to figure out do you even want to do this anymore can i tell you for those of you that work in the government [Applause] if they let you go today they got 50 people lined up to take your spot real quick there is no one lined up to take your purpose only you can fulfill it only you can make it happen only you can do this so stop thinking that everything you do outside of what is for you is so important to what god has already called you too last but not least point number four for this week it's time to do something that's greater than myself [Applause] [Music] it's time to stop letting our aspirations be good people and to be purposeful people [Music] a purposeful person makes mistakes along the way [Music] they're trying to figure it out there they're asking god for forgiveness they're getting it together they're working out this new person that they're becoming good people have to front because they're always trying to put a facade on because they want their actions to deem them good so the things that they do looks presentable to others around them i'm a good person i gave today i went to the goodwill and gave i put clothes over here i gave it god said i'm not interested in what you're doing i'm interested in who you're becoming not enough people are concerned about who you're becoming more people are concerned about what you're doing what you can do for them you need people in your life that care about who you're becoming the individual the integrity the character that's in your life who are you becoming forget what you're doing [Music] it has no weight you're working hard why because as you're working you're hoping that others see that's what good people do they do it enough so other people can see the call today is god is saying i didn't call you to be good if you never go to the good will that's not about what i'm asking you to do we're trying to be good for god god says i just need you to be purposeful i need you to live out because if you can live out my will that means you can be obedient and the bible lets us know and when we're obedient to god it is a show of our love to him not when we're good to be good scripture says in john chapter 15 8 this is to my father's glory [Music] that you bear much fruit [Music] that's to his glory not you being a good person talking nice low tone trying to act as a christian he said it's according to the fruit you bear meaning once you look at the extension of you for he is the vine we are the branches it's not about how good you are it's about the fruit you bear scripture says that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples clarity in the word of god not religion relationship you bear much fruit question today is what have you been a part of barry [Music] what's your fruit is it an action is it a way what is your fruit today and john 15 11 says this i've told you this he said not that you can be impressive not even that i'm establishing this so that because this is this command he says but when you serve [Music] when god called you out of darkness when he rescued you from your brokenness when he pulled you out of the broken places that you have been in he said i have told you this so my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete i'm going to tell you today you're over extended and trying to please your happiness because you don't have a permanent joy so you gotta find things to do and the things that you do give you a purpose and a sense and now you have joy because you do what you like to do he says no no no no no i need to let you know there's going to be problems in this world they're going to be mess-ups in this world i need you to connect in this moment that what i want to do for you is way beyond what you can imagine or think i saved you so that you could be like me i was not called to be served i came to serve you're looking for joy he says the response to you looking for joy today is that you would serve me and you would say yes lord whatever you want to do however you want to do i'll do it for you i say this to you today and i know i know it's going to be a heart space but the joy that you're missing that money a home prestige a degree we'll never give you is laying in jesus christ today he says in in romans chapter 12 verse 1 he says here's what i'm calling you to do today calling you to offer up your body that's a living sacrifice does that mean pastor that sounds weird i want you to give yourself all your thoughts all the all the things you have been taught to do i want you to give it over to me so i can teach you who to be today god wants to make you brand new in him he didn't save you so that you could walk around and say i'm good he saved you so that you can serve today he's calling us to serve in ways more than we can imagine or think it's not about your gift it's about what's inside of you god has something great on the inside i want to pray over you i want to pray whatever's inside of you will come out of you and that you will see the full manifestation of the power and presence of god in your life and from that here's how you measure your follow i see my fruit [Music] i see others lives are changed i see people coming to know jesus i see people changing around me i'm a disciple that's bearing fruit today that's all we are that's what you see here at the mix when people gather together i just want to bear fruit i want others to know that jesus is the way and this is the kind of movement that we're leading here at the mix but we understand that the resident of resurrection of jesus christ is everything that our faith stands on that discipleship is the maturing of who we are as people pour into us as on shoppers aren't and as we pour into others and today that he saved us so that we can serve
