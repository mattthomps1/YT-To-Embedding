[Music] i'm ready to get into the word of god and we are on week three of our series on unapologetic and i'm grateful uh it's been a blessing to me and i pray it's been a blessing to you if you're catching up all you got to do is go back to youtube catch the first two weeks jump in it with us we are excited to hear what god is saying daniel chapter one i want you to get out your bibles get out your notepads get out everything that you need we just say here that we believe that notetakers are what world changers and so the information that we're getting what god is speaking to us is going to change us so that we can change the world and we're coming in in daniel chapter one and we're jumping to verse eight after daniel who is a captive in babylonia and and he is in a space in his head with his friends where they're in captivity but they haven't lost sight of who they are can i tell you that that sometimes where you are can't depict who you are and so uh this this is a space where uh he and his friends um are are sort of being groomed to be a part because what the world loves to do is groom us to look like them um but you've got to come in with your own standard and you got to come in with your own understanding and your own clarity the bible says though i am in the world it does not mean i am of the world and so there's a transformation of changing a making new that's happening uh in this place and and daniel has come to a point where uh it says listen uh the king is offering them food um because uh this food is gonna make them be healthy um the world likes to oftentimes tell us what we need so that we can be good so that we can be healthy so that we can be where we need to be the world wants to tell you what your success looks like the problem is that god has already declared it over your life and so uh uh the daniel says even even though y'all got some good suggestions i i i want to let you know that god has already spoken in our lives and and and so we we we got some objections to what you want to conform us to uh we've got a different set of ideas a different set of circumstances we got a different mindset to what we want to do and so daniel begins to offer this space and it says that but daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food it said or with wine that he drank therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself can i tell you that often times you feel so uncomfortable where you are because you know it's not really who god says you are and you'll take on things and add things because people said it people told you people said you look better this way you look good doing that and sometimes you got to say listen listen i know who i am i can't define myself looking like others being like others trying to do what everyone else does i am knowing who i am in this moment and god has already spoken and daniel says listen i will not define myself he said god gave daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs and the chief of the eunuch said to daniel i fear i'm scared i know you're trying to change and i know you don't want to do what i'm asking you to do but i'm trying to tell you if you don't do it i am fearful i fear my lord the king who assigned your food and your drink for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age so you would endanger my head with the king he said then daniel said to the steward of whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over daniel and his friends han anaya mitchell and azariah it says to him he says test your servants come on come on test test test me test me test me test me you think you think this gospel isn't real you think that this savior isn't real testament let me let me show you for a couple of days let me show you for a couple of moments that god is real he says how about you test me for 10 days and let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink and then let our appearance because the product of what god is going to do in your life and in my life is going to show on the outside said test me give me vegetables and and water to drink he said let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you and deal with your servants according to what you see look at the world and look at me look at my joy and look at the world's joy look at my peace and look at the world's peace and if you don't see anything different then maybe god isn't real but i don't know like anybody else that knows is when you look at me and see the transformation of who god has made me to be it's totally different than what i could have done on my own he said so he listened to them in this manner and tested them for 10 days at the end of the 10 days it was seen because if god is truly moving in your life you will see results he said it was seen within those 10 days that they were better somebody say better i'm trying to tell you you think you're making a sacrifice but really you're just getting better you think you're denying yourself for what you really need you think you're denying yourself from a relationship you think you're denying yourself from what all your friends are doing but all i want to let you know is this god is reserving you because it's better on the way from you i don't know who wants to claim that today in this moment but the reason that you've been in obscurity the reason that you've been in the background the reason that nobody called you on friday night when you was trying to figure out where everybody was because you were in obscurity because god was doing something better god was placing you in the back for somebody say better said he was placing them in the back better appearance the bible says in fatter in the flesh i don't i really don't know what that means that's a now lord make me better but don't make me fatter now i i don't i don't know what that it said fatter in the flesh then all they used to ate the king's food and said so the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables the only way you can convince the world of who our savior is is through your life and the bible is letting us know that what they're saying is i'm not just going to talk the talk i'm going to walk the walk and you'll see the product of my life and i promise you you'll do it without jesus and you'll look at your life and i'll do it with jesus and i promise you at the end you'll come to me asking me hey what you got going on because if there's something truly transforming in my life you should see the results of who i'm becoming and who god has called for us to be i want to come from the topic today the power of a set mine the power of a set mine father in the name of jesus we're believing today that you're framing our minds you're changing our mind you're making our minds brand new and you today so lord i pray lord as we are watching online as we're in person in this moment that we will allow the word god to open our hearts to receive what you want to say to us for we love you honor and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen thank you so much amazing musicians y'all can y'all help me give it up for those that have been impacted i didn't even say who to give it up for this is just a church that loves people but it is our dream team [Applause] i love it i love it celebrate before you even know what to celebrate the idea that we're going to do is talk about the principle of the mind today the reason that we have to talk about the principle of the mind is because the mind is the controlling factor to what you do the mind is the place where you make the decision the mind is the place where you accept the fear or you reject the fear the mind is the place where you set the foundation to understanding exactly what it is that you will do and you won't do the mind is the foundational place of the warfare and you believing in the purpose that god has set over your life or you disagreeing with god has spoken over your life the mind is the place of warfare in battle i can let you know today if you feel great about yourself it's happening in the mind it's not about what you have on it's not about what you drive it's not about the number of bedrooms you have in your home in order for you to be able to keep this idea of knowing who you are it is about the state of your mind somebody say my mind i want to let you know today that the enemy is at warfare with your mind not your car not your house the enemy is not at warfare with you in particular he's trying to capture your mind why you're mine because your mind is the place that deliberates what we shall do what we shall believe how we shall act what we shall ignore what we shall accept the mind is the place that gives us the direction of who we shall become and if we don't win the battle in the mind we can't win the battle in our lives some of the greatest battles that we're fighting aren't battles because we don't have the information some of the greatest battles that we're fighting are not battles that we're fighting because we don't understand and clarity the idea is that i might have the information the idea is that my grandmother may have taken me to church and i believe but the problem with the idea is that if i don't believe it if i don't understand it if it's not a part of my thinking then guess what my actions will not change the question is not about changing your actions the question is can god change your mind if god can change your mind and your mind and your heart come into agreement then the clarity of what you will understand is that in god changing your mind you will never need an emotional boost to always get you to the next place in your life some of us always need a motivation speech always need a charge i can tell you when i go to the uh a gym i need about as much motivation as i can get i need somebody screaming in my face screaming in my ear i need somebody looking at me telling me i can't do it so i can prove them wrong to bring all of the emotions out of me to make me do what i need to do why because i'm struggling in my mind to believe the value and the worth of what this is doing for my life see if you're not convinced in your mind and you're not convincing your actions and what you will always do is fight for the need and desire to get back on track because the track is dependent upon the emotions anybody know about this anybody know you love god but something about that morning time devotion that you wish you could get up like the bible says early in the morning jesus got up and you're saying i'm glad for jesus but here's what i want to let you know something in my mind does not give me the perspective to get up at 8 00 a.m to give god all the praise and the glory at 8 am i'm barely just making it i'm running out the door i'm looking at people off the side i say don't you say a word i gotta get out of here here's the idea it is a mind issue that we're struggling with because if i knew in my mind what i know about work what i understand in my mind is i'm convinced if i don't get to work on time they're gonna fire me but if you in your mind were convinced that if i spent some time with god he would change my very day and change my very circumstances when that bell hit at six o'clock i don't care if i'm dragging out the bed i don't care if i'm falling out i would say my mind is telling me if i don't get this time in with god something is going to take me off track it's a mind thing i do love god i know you do pastor i really want to i know you do i'm trying to live worthy i know you are but the problem is is you're struggling in your mind and your mind and your emotions are at war and one is trying to say i'm more important than the other and it's saying go with what you feel and god is saying go with what i've told you you're saying go with the way it looks and god is saying go on with what i've told you it shall be i want to let you know today that yeah oftentimes we're at war in relationship in relationship with god and and and what i think is familiar about daniel chapter one is daniel is in a foreign land he is in a land where he is in captivity oftentimes our battles start in our mind it's not about where you are it's not about where you live it's not about the condition of your circumstances it is about the condition of your mind daniel was in captivity with his friends he had been chosen to be a part of those who were special to the king and the bible says the king is offering him food so that the king can make him like he believes that daniel should be the problem is is that he doesn't understand there was a seed placed inside of daniel shadrach meshach and abednego that could not be destroyed that could not be unplugged and what happened was there were some laws that were given to them in their early beginnings that let them know that there was something greater than what they feared and what they felt oftentimes you got to be careful because you'll operate off of what you fear and what you feel i'm trying to tell you if you don't get that thing right in you you'll operate in life and say how do i feel and what's my fear i'm here today to let you know even when your feelings differ and your fear is great god is still calling you to follow him god lets us know that he's offered this meeting daniel says i feel like privately because daniel got some sense y'all i will not eat of the king's meat now he didn't say that out loud the bible says he he gets to the eunuch real hey real quick come here i can't do this you ever somebody ever tried to pull you into something and you didn't want to say it to everybody but you need to get them on the side real quick to let them know i i don't do that yeah you didn't i don't want to be the holy one i don't want to be the spiritual one but you sit down at the table and and everybody you know this is this is my way i'm not spiritual it's just i'm really this it's just the object of the way my mind thinks we sit down and they have the wine glasses at the table and they said anybody want a wine i said no no no no i'm good i i don't drink i've been in places oh oh pastor i'm sorry you don't drink i said no no no no no no that's not that's not your conviction that's my conviction i don't drink that's not my place of being oh that's not what i want to do in this moment and and i notice that people get offended when you've made a decision you ever seen that before people get they mad at you because you've decided what you're going to do with your life and you're trying to figure out well why well why you mad at me because i made a decision because there were some laws and some beliefs and some values that i upheld or that were a part of my decision making that regardless of where i go or where i am it's not going to change who i am daniel understood it didn't matter if he was in babylon it didn't matter if he was in exile it didn't matter where he was in the desert daniel said i am god's man and it doesn't matter what you offer me what you share for me it doesn't matter how much you give me it doesn't matter if it's all that i wanted if it's not according to the will of god i don't want it because what he said is if it's out of god's will this is what it will do it'll defile me anything that defiles me upsets me it takes me and disconnect with god it pulls me out of my blessings it pulls me out of the miracles that god has laid over my life it pulls those things that are already done and keeps them from happening which is on earth i want to let you know there's something about understanding if this temple gets the foul i'm fighting for something greater than just your opinion you don't understand half of the time i'm fighting for my life because you don't understand that the reason i don't drink is because there's a history of drinking and there's a history of addiction and there's a history of things becoming what overwhelming and i'm making the decision that the decision that god has spoken in my life is a decision for not only me but for my future sometimes you're not making decisions just for you you're making decisions for what's to come why you don't do that in your house i like to do it but it's not beneficial for my household so what i made a decision to do is not bring in things that the enemy has already set up as a stumbling block over my life and the generations in my life i made the decision to stop it off there why is that important because it may not be about how i feel but it is about the truth of what i know so dan says i don't want this unclean i was unclean about it pastor well usually they would sacrifice the meats to the gods and daniel knew this this was sanctioned idolatry i'm not doing that can i tell you that everything that people say no to that as christians is not just about what they think is bad it's about them understanding their greater implications behind the decisions that we make that can have further circumstances issues or create open doors for addictions that i am making the decision not even to step into i'm telling you this because you may have under realized that the moments of what you've been standing for have been moments that have kept you from losing your mind there are things in your life that should have never entered in that it would never have caused you to get free from you only need freedom from bondage if you're not in bondage you don't need freedom but there was a sea to bondage that got you in let me tell you whatever it is you didn't just jump in it that thing was working from the beginning of when you started and god is so good at at delivering us he says listen i got to get the root i got to get the all of that mess out of you that you think is a part of your life and your past i got to help you see it differently but here's what i got to do i've got to correct your truth because in the world today we all have our own truths got the truth about the way i see myself got the truth a bit about the way i call myself i got the truth about the way i want you to see me i got the truth about the way that i believe i have my own truth about what god's word says for me and the problem is is we're comparing our truths with god's truth not knowing that the right truth can do something for you what can a right truth the bible says in john chapter 8 verse 31 through 32 so jesus said to the jews who have believed in him if you abide in my somebody say my word cool you got to have my word because if you abide in it then you're truly my what i can't tell you if you're a disciple or not but jesus said i can he said if you abide in my word you're truly my disciples and if you're truly my disciples then you'll know the what the truth and as you know the truth the truth will do what there we go no freedom it's because of lack of truth a lack of truth is because of a lack of following a lack of following is because of lack of word they're all correlated pastor we just out here feeling doing our own thing you're probably avoiding the word because if so the word will bring truth and that truth would set you free now the truth can set you free and it will if you accept it but you got to accept the truth which means you got to do some self evaluation about you oh shucks i got to look at me anybody just want to be honest you think you're pretty good anybody you know just i mean you're not going to say it out loud but you looking at me smile like fast i'm pretty perfect it's the rest of the world that needs to catch up i am pretty perfect where i am like i mean come on look at me you know what i'm saying i got it together and the enemy decides that if he can lie to you enough he can take your mind captive and if he can take your mind captive then that means he has control over everything else see here's the thing the product of your actions is only a product of your thinking and your thinking is a product of your truth and your truth is a product of god's word if god's word is in you his truth brings what discipleship discipleship means i'll do what i'll follow even when i don't like to that's why scripture says in order for you to be my disciples you have to what first deny your self i'm not denying me i like me too much but the bible says you you got to get some truth james 1 21 says therefore what put away all what filthiness i'm not a filthy pastor and rampant wickedness and it says and receive with somebody say meekness the implanted word which is able to save your souls god's word has to become implanted in you 2005 i received a kidney transplant i did not go in get the kidney put it under my arm and walk out the hospital and say i should be good to go from here no they had to set up a surgery they had to set up a time where they knocked me out they had to set up a time where i was laying on the table they had to set up a time where i was so out of myself that they could do what they needed to do in me without me interrupting you want to know what romans 12 1 says brothers and sisters therefore i urge you to present yourselves your bodies all of you as a living sacrifice oh sh well what do we do with sacrifices we kill them and open them i don't want to go to the temple because the temple will tell you what you do with the inside you do something with the inside to take it out so the sacrifice is what available to god to do what it says the implanted implanted word uh they knocked me out they cut me open i'm guessing that's what they did because that's what the scar says because when god does work there's a scar that's left because the old you is fighting against the new you so there's gonna be a battle there's gonna be a struggle but you will heal because the old you doesn't have to stay the same way we're on the table they they opened me up and then and man they put the kidney in but here's the thing i think it's so relatable is that they have to wait for the kidney to act and to take let me tell you this just because you're reading god's word doesn't mean it's active it's got to be active on the inside of you that's why the bible says i hide that word in my heart that i might not sin against thee he didn't just say read it but he said hide the word in your heart that you might not say so so so so they have to wait for my kidney to wake up so i wake come on man wake up i'm stepping on you know come on and that's what some of us do is we're trying to wake up the word by just coming to church i'm just going 10 on sunday that should be good for the rest of the week the enemy is like i'm gonna be on you so quick when you get out that building you matter of fact i'll start working on you in the seat the kidney has to wake up and then they they they sold me they saw me back up and then it has to get to working and and it has to accept my body that it doesn't reject so i'm on anti-rejection medication because daily my body is working against that which seems foreign to me but god's saying no but the kidney is saving your life you got to get this [Music] it feels foreign in you but is saving you and working in you over and over and you got to do everything the bible says to keep it from what being rejected [Music] i got to watch this thing i gotta because the enemy is lying to me the enemy is trying to tell me on the inside that i'm not worth today god doesn't love me and that god doesn't care and you got to keep saying to yourself no no no the bible lets us know that he loved me he loved me so much that he came to this earth and he gave his one and only son he loves me so much that the bible lets me know that that he would do anything for me it says your mother and the father can forsake you but the bible says then the lord will take you up you just got to remind yourself even though the word is inside of you it doesn't mean that the enemy won't try to push it out so you know what i gotta do i gotta go get blood work i gotta go test it i gotta i gotta make sure the levels are good i gotta i gotta go and check on it when something goes too fast i got to increase it more so sometimes when that word is is in you but it seems like the enemy is fighting you need a little bit more word you need a little bit more prayer you need a little bit more time of fasting it's not always the same because the levels are always changing it's changing up so i gotta watch it 15 years in i still gotta watch it why because it still can reject it's not a done deal because you've been in church for 10 years it's not a done deal because you're here every sunday it's not a done deal because you know some scriptures it's a done deal because you're deadly looking at it and you're defying all odds and saying i know what i feel but i know what he said [Applause] i know what i feel but i know what he said i know what this looks like but i know what he said i know what they're saying but i know what he said and if we don't pay attention the enemy is very good at making us question what god says in genesis 3 the bible says verse 1 says now the serpent was more crafty can i let you know the enemy is crafty he knows we you've been having a struggle with he knows what what you've been complaining about not necessarily praying about because he gets fearful of prayer he doesn't get fearful of complaints so some of us have been given the enemy too much entry by complaining and not allowing that complaint to be a prayer listen if you're gonna give somebody information then you might as well give them information with power i'm talking about this but i want to let you know what i'm talking about i'm praying about we're giving and we're we're giving him this information and we're we're trying to figure out what's inside of us lord lord what are you saying the bible says he's crafty he's good he knows when to come he knows the time of month where you when you always get depressed he knows the moments he knows the people to put around you that aren't like who you know them to be he knows your patterns he's crafty we're reading genesis y'all he was crafty at the top you're like no i got this i got mental power enemy like yeah we'll see how that goes but the bible says he was crafted in any other beast of the field that the lord god had made he said and he said to the woman this is what he's always doing he's questioning god's word did god actually say i got it today i'm i got it today i know i'm more than a conqueror i know i have purpose dick did god actually say that i i've got peace today that goes beyond understanding i listen the love of god he's forgiven me did he really because i can just sow a seed of condemnation which will make you wrestle with your position in christ all the time he's always actually asking did he actually say that man i'm great i know i'm great are you really look at your past let me just look at your conditions look at where you come from do you actually think that god will use you maybe maybe you're right maybe god can't use somebody like me and the whole time god is saying you're great you're powerful you're amazing you're all the man and woman i've ever called for you to be you shall be a blessing in the earth you shall be a blessing to those around you you shall and he's just like but inshallah and he comes to take captive your mind because if he can play with your mind he can play with your destiny if he can play with your mind he he can play with the direction that you if he if he can play with your mind he can have you doing things that you never thought you would ever do because he's making you question what he's already spoken over your life my question today is what do you keep questioning that god has already spoken and where are you today and your thought process about who you are because daniel said i will not define here's what you got to understand every time you allow the enemy to whisper in your mind without checking it you allow yourself to be defied by his lies don't you agree with it today you got to check that thing at the door you've got to um i'm not doing that sometimes you got no i'm not going down that way it's not gonna happen today because sometimes today i'm not in the right place like daniel you're not in the strength point you're not in sunday service you're not with the worship team behind you so you don't have the strength like you had to conquer on sunday when you in there like yeah let the devil mess with me monday came he was like boy i'm about to give up your conditions are different but it doesn't mean god's word is second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 it says this we we pull down we we pull and say we yank and say we tip it says we pull down every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of god and we take every somebody say every every thought i don't care what it is we take every thought captive anybody ever ordered that amazon before and they tell you like you need that order and you watching that thing like a hawk anybody ever been there before you're like you like like you it's either amazon or it's a fedex or ups and they and they allow for shipping and and they allow you to track the driver y'all be looking at him seven stops away six stops away four wait five wait what oh no i'm about to go find him a man can't even finish his route you on him hey you got a package for me i didn't even get to your house don't worry about it you can give it to me right now because the idea is whatever it is that they have you need and if you need it you'll go after it well if you need peace then you'll protect your mind from everything that brings destruction i'll take captive the dog you know today's not a good give me that thought today is a great day you know if you go down that street they could you know what i'm taking captain that the god is protecting me and watching over me but if you don't allow yourself to take captive every thought and make it obey christ lord i just thought that here you go i just thought this way here you go i just got tempted here you go i don't know what to do with it and truth of the matter is i don't even want to touch it because if i get my hands on it i'll go back to what i used to do so i take the thought captive and i do what i give it to god stop being scared that god is scared of your thoughts lord i looked at that shouldn't have looked at it take that thought take that thought and let the lord be like don't worry about that i got that the bible says we're we're taking these thoughts we're taking them captive but we're not keeping them we're giving them over to god so that they obey him so in order to do that the first point i want you to get and understand is that you must understand the state of your mind can i be honest with you real quick nobody know how crazy you are than you i mean we know a little bit but we don't know really you know what i mean like is that you that don't nobody know when it's just you i'm listening you love him she love you listen i get it this is my partner we are one no there's this little part of you that don't everybody know about that if they hit the wrong button or say the wrong thing all of that you comes out real quickly i have to pray because oftentimes i'm that person that can be reactive instead of thinking out where i go i'm gonna tell you i lose it real quick somebody jam on the brakes what you do i'm going through a hole what you got you i know you ain't trying to look at them in their rear view mirror i know you see me see you see me and i just want to let you know i do not like you i mean you are just losing it you got to understand the state of your mind every time i go down this street somebody wears me out stop going down that street because you and your mind cannot handle it cannot you need to know the state of your mind so you know what to be able to pray for daniel wasn't just like i don't need to eat the king's meat because it'll defile me daniel said it'll defile me my body my way of thinking my mindset and if i get hooked on the king's things then i'll start needing the king's things and i don't want to get hooked on something that i don't want to even be a part of so what you got to say to yourself is i'm not going that way at all at all at all you gotta understand the state of your mind where's your mind at if you're married ask your partner real quick where's my mind you cr oh you want the truth [Laughter] you my bad i didn't know it it slipped out real fast i didn't know you wanted me to tell you the state of your mind real quick because if you understand the state of your mind you understand where you don't compromise because the state of my mind says i know i will compromise with these set of circumstances i i you put me there and i'll linger there you put enough images there i'll watch it there you have enough conversation about it i'll start feeding into it it may not be the normal part of me but oftentimes if i don't know the state of my mind the way i've been conditioned the way that i think the way that i get it you got to go back and look at mama sometimes and be like mama you crazy don't tell her just and then you come back and be like i'm pretty crazy too kill me you crazy hungry you think that way i probably think that way too i gotta get a hold of my mind and myself because it's important to know the state of where i am because i'll tell you we think real highly of ourselves and our proud thoughts aren't able to be pulled down so they're battling with god's truths so your condition is pull the thoughts down take every somebody say every every thought captive even the thoughts that are godly thoughts that you thought are right thoughts because some of you need to take your christian thoughts through god's view that's what the bible say right no wait is it is it what the bible says no let's filter that through god come on god come on i need this to obey what you meant not obey what i thought because we all interpret differently according to the condition of where we are so you need to run god's word through god i was reading this today and i got a little bit off lord i need you to help me understand what your word is saying so i don't misinterpret it for my own desire because the conditions that surround me will make me take the scripture and i suggest it so that it fits my circumstance instead of it being the truth of what i need the word of god to be that's for the church people is that we need to take you through the filter of what god says romans 12 and 2 says this don't copy the behavior and customs of this world but be a somebody say new and different underline that because everything that's new isn't different it might be a new relationship but i don't mean it's a different one same type of person same issues same addictive states same ways of thinking just a new person but not a different god wants you new and different y'all like ah nah man it may be a new house but you're still not paying the same pills just because it's new don't mean you gonna do different can i tell single folk if you dating just because the relationship moves from dating dating or talking talking to being engaged just because the status is new doesn't mean there's anything different and because you change something or move something it doesn't mean it makes it different it just means that you've given it a place to hide further that's why i tell people i'm going to another state to get better to get recruits i don't know if this is a state i don't think it's a whole state that's the issue i'ma move from texas because this is too much problems texas is the biggest and you you blame in texas you're blaming sets of circumstances because you want new but you don't want different he says no i came that there would be new and different a person with fresh newness in all you do and you think then you will learn from your own experience how his ways will really satisfy you if you're not satisfied it's probably because you're not connected with his ways the bible says his ways will really satisfy you okay okay point number two this is gonna be a real quick one match your truth with god's word y'all don't even have to ask me sometimes because what i've learned is people do not like the implementations behind god's word because it questions your actions and you think your actions are always pure and true and it puts to question is there a possibility that what i did was actually not right but how many of you want to be in here you know you don't like being questioned just be y'all know you know how you know you remember i said at the top nobody know how crazy you are but you that's why you have to take the truth of what you believe against the truth of what god says what does his word say what is he saying about this in my life what is he saying about this moment what is he saying i need to do because they need because i love this even a lot of times when i do counseling people love to give me the rundown of who like who got them to this place i'd be like is there anybody else involved in this no just them i was like so are we gonna talk about you uh or we just gonna blame it on if everybody else gets their self together we'll be together no no the truth of god's word is when you read god's word it shows you yourself that's a true interpretation i like people go and get god's word and have a word for everybody else but themself have a transformation for everybody else but them and today i'm letting you know is god's word is here to transform your life psalm 119 105 says this by your words i can see where i'm going they throw a beam of light on my what dark path you need a light on that dark path because you've been searching for a long time and god says i have something greater for you and last but not least our last point our last point our last one you gotta live out daily victory somebody say daily do i have to fight the enemy daily yes this battle is not about a one moment freedom it's about a daily victory i'm winning today i'm winning today i'm winning today every day you have to be a part of what the victory i've got to put up the victory today why do i got to pray every day because you need the victory every day why do you need to because i need to win the battle because there's a word in me but the enemy is always trying to make it reject what god says so i gotta live out daily victories when you come to church i just get excited because i feel like you got here and after the week you just had and after all the prayers you just gave up the fact that you even still made a decision to walk into the house of the lord and to give god the praise and honor and glory that is due unto his name i figure it'd be something that we celebrate the lord together why because i have a victory for today yesterday may not have been the victory that i thought i could have had but i'm letting you know today i get to start it all over the bible says brand new mercies every what morning i i'm just excited because i've got another opportunity it's early in the morning but the lord is with me it's early in the morning but he's got in my footsteps this is the right way to start it off this is the right way to operate this is what god has given me every sunday i come in thinking god this is a fresh start all over again you're going to give me a word for this week that'll bring me out i'm not going to fall like i did yesterday because i'm living out what daily victories daily will i seek you daily will i know you daily will i walk in your promises daily will i receive your blessing i'm praying every day let thy will be done all over as it is in heaven god everything you have for me i want a daily daily bread daily blessings daily miracles daily god doing work in me i'm here to let you know you can't take a break from what god is doing because the enemy is not taking a break from what he's doing the bible says he's as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he is every day looking for you he is every day watching after you've got to say i've got the victory today when i hit that alexa i be like alexa shut up stop hitting that alarm but i need alexa to tell me back just remember though you've got the victory today if you got to set that as an alarm if you got to set that as a quote you need something you got the victory today okay i need to know that because the way i'm feeling when i woke up the restlessness that i had all through the night the things that were on my heart as i was sweating in the bed the way that the enemy was tossing and turning my mind i don't feel like i have the victory but i need to wake up and know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world whatever i'm facing today i got this thing baby whatever i'm facing today i'm built for this thing baby whatever is coming my way i've got the victory why are you so pumped because i've been walking in victory every day 365 days saying god is good and greater is he that is in me and when i'm walking and guess what i'm walking with my head held high because i'm victorious [Music] i'm victorious daily they don't take all that it does it takes that and more scripture lets us know ii corinthians i feel like it was a testimony of mine but it says it is true that i am an ordinary weak human being but the difference between what you may do at times and what i do is that i don't use human plans and methods to win my battle it's not about how great i am it's about greater that is he that's in me he can't be in me if his word isn't in me it says the one my bibles i i use god's mighty weapons not those made by men to knock down the devil's strongholds these weapons can break down every every proud argument against god and every wall that can be built to keep men from finding him it says i will use these weapons because you can have weapons and not use them i know people who carry and conceal but they never actually use you got to use your weapon daily i will use these weapons against every rebel who remains after i have first used them on you yourselves and surrendered to christ with these weapons it says i will capture rebels and bring them back to god and change them into men whose hearts desire is obedience in christ today i'll let you know there's a daily victory that you have pastor i don't know i haven't memorized all the bible man you know what daniel said he said the product of what you see is not in what people say he said at the end of the 10 days you'll see i'm better yeah the question is are you better are you better than where you were are you better than yesterday are you better than where you used to be if you can walk about like i'm just a little bit better then you give god the glory i'm better than where i was because the result of god's word isn't for the deep revelation it's the revelation to apply it to your life and the application brings change [Music] pastor what do you know i know that in my victories god has given me a testimony [Music] i don't talk all the time y'all except for my stage when i get in my own way and kind of life i don't really start talking a lot because sometimes i don't feel fit to be able to lead people everywhere they need to go because at times i'm having my own struggles within asking god lord are you sure you said that see one thing i know is that when you stay humble before god's presence in his hand god will lead you and guide you and use you i have the time to walk around quoting scriptures at people and thinking i've got it all together let me pull you all together so i can share a word i walk up on the stage and i'm asking god daily you sure me [Music] you sure on me this week [Music] you sure you want to use me because monday wasn't the best monday i wasn't in the best frame of mind [Music] i jammed on my brakes i gave them that sidearm look y'all know that's hot i look it wasn't pastoral and the way life is going right now half the time i'm praying is not one of my saints that i'm being part of i look over to somebody from the church like hey pastor i'm like bless you bless you [Music] and i just look over god deliver them [Music] it's not me [Music] stay humble before the mighty hand of god because when you humble yourself he exalts you you have to put yourself in position but god said i'll exalt you but the whole thing of it is is the set part of our mind must understand that i am in this regardless of what happens i've made a commitment i have made a decision to follow jesus all the way they used to sing a song there's no turning back there's no option b there's no do i go back to where it's no there's no turning back i follow jesus i won't stop i'll make mistakes along the way but i won't stop because i've set in my mind he is my everything he's not the balance of my family and church there is no balance in god he is my everything [Music] so today i just want to know will you set your mind on the things of the spirit well you set your mind on the things of the flesh and if you set your mind on the things of the spirit the bible lets us know that through his spirit he came to bring the truth and through that truth he came to bring freedom and through that freedom you live out your purpose he's called for you to live
