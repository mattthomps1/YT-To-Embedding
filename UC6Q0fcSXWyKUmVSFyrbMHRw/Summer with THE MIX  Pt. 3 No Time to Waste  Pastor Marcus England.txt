worship ministry like that and so grateful for our worship team and just what god is doing i'm ready to get into the word of god so if you can open your bibles if you can get your notepads here at the mix that we know that readers are leaders and that no takers are what world changers tell your neighbor real quick you're a world changer you are a world changer first chronicles chapter 12 first chronicles chapter 12. and it's father's day so fathers i know that you ready to get to the mistakes that grill food them crabs so i'm gonna part a word in your heart that i believe will speak into your future and i believe that we have an opportunity to speak with us save the lord first chronicles chapter 12 the context of this scripture comes as david is in ziglag and david understands that he's anointed for something that he hasn't been positioned for yet david's anointing is all over his life but i want to let you know today just because you're anointed does not mean it's your season in time to move into what god has spoken the promise over your life but while you're waiting in process god always puts people in your life to uphold you in process until the promise comes to pass and the bible lets us know that in this moment david has some men that are with him and first chronicles chapter 12 begins to identify who these men aren't it you can read it for yourself matter of fact i encourage you to go back and read this but as david is in ziklag and he is understanding that that time is coming where he's been pursued by saul the philistines have rejected him he understands that even though he's not positioned he has those that are positioned in his corner for when god is ready to move i'm telling you some things that god is building some people that god are building around you are for the promise that is yet to come so don't reject the people and the groups that are trying to surround you because you're trying to achieve the promise by yourself there's somebody that you need and that god has said over your life and i'm going to encourage you today don't you do this thing by yourself but you get in a company of people so that they can be a part of your journey as god moves you into promotion first chronicles chapter 12 starting at verse 31-33 and we start here and he speaks about the tribes and says of the half tribe of manassas 18 000 who are expressly named to come and make david king can i tell you before david was an influencer he was an influencer before he had gotten famous he had already had followers because followers are not about your popularity followers about your impact the bible says there's 18 000 already ready to make him king but it says in verse 32 there's a group a group of men that are from issachar and it says of issachar men who had understanding of the times it says to know what israel ought to do 200 chiefs and all their kinsmen under their command it said in verse 33 and says of zebulun 50 000 it said season somebody say seasoned can i tell you young folk if you don't have some older folk in your life that have some season and some wisdom and some maturity to help lead you you will never fully conquer the way you are supposed to it said of zebulun there were 50 000 seasoned troops equipped for battle not getting equipped they had already gone through process they were equipped for battle with all the weapons of war and i want to tell you today why we may not have physical weapons of war the bible says that we understand the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they are mighty through god through the pulling down of strongholds if you don't have any seasoned folk in your life that can pull down some strongholds that can break down some bondage that can move some barriers that can pray you through you always stop at the place where you're not equipped it says they were there to help david with singleness of somebody say purpose my god singleness of purpose seasoned understanding clarity and so i want to speak today from the topic no time wasted no time wasted tell your neighbor no time wasted tell your second neighbor no time wasted tell your third choice i'm sorry you're my third choice but no time wasted you got to you got to understand today my time is valuable anybody understand that today anybody understand the time is like money y'all you can't even get that thing time is important and so today i want to talk from the topic there's no time wasted we really got something to do let's pray father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that in this time that every moment of it would be your voice speak in this place and allow your presence to be everything that we need not to just hear change but to be changed in your name we pray somebody say amen amen god bless you thank you so much musicians real quick i want to give it up for our dream team that's in the house the people that make it happen can y'all help me celebrate them real quick y'all just love on them real quick one thing i know is that it's important that with the time that we have we know what to do with it i think it's very important that we understand with time we must use time wisely and the purpose as we understand in ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 that there is a time and a season under heaven for all things in understanding in those all things i believe what god wants us to know is that we got to use time well y'all now i don't know if if many of you are doing this but this summer is a great time to be able to take vacation and vacation can mean different things i i don't know if you vacation and how you vacation but many times when we're going to the caribbean islands y'all know how we do we like going down to the beach in the sand and and the sun we love uh to be able to be a part of something that's all inclusive because that's an american thing we need we need everything to be inclusive because we like to overdo it all the time we we want to over eat we we we want we don't want to pay for it we want it included in it i want to order y'all know the the we we want to get a room service whenever i just want to i want everything to be all inclusive and so when i go to wind down the purpose is that i can get rest somebody say rest when i want to get rest i really recognize there's some things i can do now each of us has a preference of what rest is rest for me is not sitting in the hot sun under an umbrella maybe for you it is for me it is not i don't like to sweat in my rest i already do that in my unrest i'm already trying to figure out what i'm doing i'm already trying to figure out where i'm going but some people like my wife she loves it she she loves to jump into the hot tub and it's 99 degrees in the hot tub and she's in there boiling and if you just put a little bit of seasoning in there she is one level in temperature from being cooked she says baby you want to go to the hot tub i said no it's torture for me it's not something i love doing and so and so in context i love the opportunities to be able to rest anybody know about russ i've told you about this before i love watching the animal channel you know that first two days that just break me down and get a little bit of rest y'all i like doing nothing not having to think about nothing but after day two it's time to turn up it's time to get the jet skis it's time to go to the remote islands it's time to zipline it's time to do every activity that makes me question am i going to heaven or not i'm just at the edge of it y'all you get me on the right day i'm going to take it as far as i can well rest looks different and timing looks different for some people the idea is that you must understand the purpose of what it is you're doing and when you are doing it because if you don't understand the purpose you'll be disappointed in the season it's a messed up thing when you go somewhere to rest but you work because you don't understand the purpose of what the time is for understanding time gives you clarity a purpose and purpose gives you the agenda for what you do in your life if you can get an understanding that your agenda is set by your purpose not your agenda is set by your feelings then what you'll understand is according to what i'm supposed to be doing in this moment i recognize that i have a set agenda for a set purpose somebody say purpose when i go into each season of my life i've got to be able to declare and understand that for this season of it i have to do what is needed in the season even though it does not always feel comfortable for where i am some of us know that in january we talked about a hot summer body the problem is it's from january to may we did not do what was necessary for the hot summer body every time we heard this may i help you can i get a number one upsize of fries double the drink no ice you all know how we do and then june gets here and we're frustrated i don't understand i eat well i don't understand i don't know what's happening here's the problem it's that many times i get distracted in the process not following the season that i'm supposed to follow but i have an expectation of results that are not conducive to what i did in the season previous and the context is is that what you want to see in this season is only the result of what you did in your process if you expected to go and be a part of something amazing this summer if you expected to go on a vacation that was so amazing that you couldn't imagine and you wanted to see the blue waters but you did not save this summer can i tell you that you can have a staycation right at your home because whatever you prepared yourself for is what you see the result of now the question is is are you stuck in the wrong season that's moved on in your life and you're expecting different results from it that you have not done anything for my question today is what is happening around your life that's preparing you to take you into the next season anybody ready for the next season of promotion of what god has for you anybody ready for the next season that god already promised that you're like i've got to do this thing i've got to have it the problem that i have oftentimes is do i know my season that's the question do you know your season or are you living from moment to moment expecting the season to work itself out the bible says in chronicles chapter 12 that david is anointed to be king but he's not king yet but what he's doing in the process is bringing alongside of him men people those who can help him as he moves forward and it speaks of these men of issachar men who understand the signs of the time fathers my question today is do you understand the time of where you are do you understand the time of where your family is do you understand the time of how to lead in your household families i am trying to understand do you get it or are you moving in a season where you're off and you don't know what you're supposed to be doing can i tell you that in order to understand the season you've got to have discernment and in order to have discernment it means you've got to talk with god because the problem is is that you will follow a template for life for your family that was never supposed to be introduced because god gave you something somebody say different the problem is is often times we don't understand that we're different just tell your neighbor real quick you're different a little different you you're a little different you you you're not like everybody else and and you're not all folded in and look like everybody else and trying to be like everybody else there's something different about you but here's the thing if you're placed into a template then you will act accordingly to the template and not according to the purpose and many of us are living out a template life that was set in front of us instead of living out a purpose-filled life that god called for us to live just because the template looks good if the template can provide me a safe and secure job to get me to where i want to be then i stay in the template if the template can produce the ideas that i have in my head there's something about the template that i need if the template is something that my parents taught me then i'll stay within the template the problem is is that the template was not made for you for the bible lets me know you're made in the image and likeness of god and there's something special about who you are but it's easier to stay comfortable and do what everybody else is doing than to find out i've got purpose beyond what i understand and think somebody in here needs to break the template [Applause] and i think the idea of the template is so easy because the template doesn't make me have to consult god it only makes me consult myself if i know the template is to make sure that i go here i go here i go to school i get this degree i come out i do this and this is the way my life ends and then at 60 i retire to enjoy life the problem is is that i think the enemy has been really good at john 10 and 10. for the bible says the thief comes to steal kill and destroy and we're thinking physical life and we're thinking that the enemy is coming to steal kill and destroy and take away everything we have he says no no i just want to destroy your purpose because if i can put you in a template like everybody else and you can follow like everybody else does then you have no impact you make no difference you stay like everybody else you do what everyone else does and you don't have the impact in the world that you're supposed to have so he says i'll just kill still and destroy your identity kill still and destroy your identity you'll be like everybody else and you'll do what everybody else does and you'll get in relationships like everybody else does and you'll fall like everybody else does and you'll sin like everybody else does and you'll stay in a broken mindset like everybody else does and you'll do the bare minimum like everyone else does and you'll flash your paycheck like everyone else does and you'll get a car that you can't afford like everyone else does and you'll get a house that you can't afford like everyone else does and you'll get in this process of living out life and the problem of it is is that you get nowhere only in the eyes of people where they're not impressed and god said you are called to be impressive if you could just be you [Music] [Applause] but the problem is you look like everybody else you do what everybody else does and he said i need some people i need some men who understand the signs of the time [Applause] i need some men and women who can follow but be different i need some men and women who can uphold what god has said over their life and be something greater and not just be a duplicate it's like sometimes you walk to people and you want to say i've seen you before and what you're saying is is i may not have physically seen you but i've seen you before because you look you talk you operate and you move in the same mindset that everybody else does and i'm here to expose the enemy because i believe that if we can get a generation and a group of men who understand they were made in the image and likeness of god that we are so great that god didn't even create vegetation on the earth until he had in genesis it says for someone to be able to work the ground and till the crown he said the responsibility and the dominion that i give you as a man to command to direct and to give instruction to comes from me if we had a group of men that could be such aware of what god was saying and knew the signs of the time then they would be able to lead a community into a place of strength and direction but the problem is is we're trying to follow everybody else and i'm here today to let you know you're more unique than you understand the scripture says in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9. it says this but this is precisely what is written it says god has prepared somebody say prepared means it is ahead of time he's not preparing he's not doing it while you're here he has somebody say this word again prepared which means it's already done tell your neighbor real quick it's already done he has prepared things for those who love him that no eye has seen and nor ear has heard or that haven't crossed the mind of any human being the problem that i had is that you're trying to do what every eye has seen and every ear has heard and everything that's already an idea by somebody else and god is saying regardless of your education regardless of what your father did regardless of what your mother did i want to let you know there are some things in store for you that no eye has seen and no ear has heard and no mind has conceived that god has in store for you somebody give god a praise in here for what he has in store for you [Applause] if you understood the purpose you wouldn't settle if you understood what god had settled inside of you you would not keep going back to the same redundant ways that you're living out you wouldn't keep being the individual who does not have the promise and understanding of god over their life i'm here today to let you know we need more men to stand up with purpose clarity and understanding to stop being scared of what their past said and start understanding what god is speaking today here's where i want to put a roadblock god is not interested in your ideas he's interested in giving you vision for your life let me define this thing for you an idea is something that only benefits you so many of us have ideas that are only for the benefit of us they impact nobody they're only about the increase of our income when in genesis 12 he told abraham i would bless you so that you can be a blessing the reason that your idea has come to pass and you're over with it and you're done and you're bored and you're sleeping because you don't have vision can see ideas are short-lived and ideas can be accomplished by you without god if you have all the pieces to the puzzle that means your idea is from you but if you've got a vision that you have no clarity and understanding about the resources and where it's coming from if you don't have a vision about i don't know how i'm going to get my family from out of this place and to a new place if you have no vision for your marriage if you have no vision for your household you can see no further than the next step because vision is from god and vision is for the world some of us just love having ideas good ideas guess what happens when men tell me ideas i don't get excited pass them and build the business all right it's fine but where's the vision i'ma have 10 employees sorry what's the vision because the vision impacts the world tell me its impact not its resources because the 10 people that you want on staff are only resources to fulfill the vision if you don't have the vision the bible says without a vision people what perish real quick some of us are perishing while we're living can we have a good time in here charles just maybe you mean you know what i mean like when connected if you if you don't have a vision then you don't have anything to wake up to because an idea you can easily throw away because ideas sometimes work and don't work a vision is not about it working a vision is about having the resources that god has for your life to see it come to pass visions come to pass ideas happen so my question is do you have a vision if your father today and your marriage do you have a vision for your family if i asked your wife today what's the vision for your family what are you going what they gonna say what's the vision not what you're doing next year next year's an idea what's the vision where we going what we look like what's our spiritual weight can you speak over our life can you talk the talk that god has because the idea is that god has called forth men who understand the time the bible lets us know issachar these men understood the time it was chronological time which means they had intellectual wisdom then it is they had spiritual understanding in order to direct the bible said not just themselves but it said the whole company of israel the question is do you have enough foundation and vision from god to lead somebody else outside of yourself or have you gotten stuck in a season and in a time you know when my wife and i we got married we talked about where we wanted to go we had in what somebody said an idea we had an idea but the thing was we needed to get a vision can i tell you your idea of buying a house is not a vision where your family goes not where your family lives it's different what you build on the lot you get isn't vision it's an idea because here's the thing with god or without god you can get it the question that i want to ask you is do you have vision do you understand the time do you understand what god is asking of you not do you understand what you feel like doing in this season because the bible says they were men of somebody say wisdom i need somebody with some wisdom tell them ask your neighbor real quick do you have any wisdom y'all all low y'all scaredy our neighbors why y'all sit bomb if y'all was scared of them because we have no time to waste we can't waste the moment that we have so if i don't understand the season that i'm in then i waste the time that i have and then the people around me don't benefit from my vision your family should benefit from your vision not your idea because your idea can change the vision that god has does it somebody catching it i appreciate it thank you listen i worked hard you know worked hard on this anthony he was with me all week so he somebody say vision all men i want you to write this down in your notes i need a vision for my life i need a vision for my wife i need a vision for my children pastor i don't have no wife well if you plan on getting one you need to have a vision before she gets there because what we have i'mma get in trouble is boys and girls with ideas and we lack a community of men and women with vision so all we're doing is running the template game and the template game is i got money you got money so let's get together problem is is anybody married no it don't work out like that all right hold on hold it down we don't want people to know your business hold it down it takes more than an idea to sustain the community of people around your life it takes a vision in order to be able to set people forward for without a vision people perish the question is who's perishing around you because you've settled an idea as a vision [Applause] so what it means is no one can take from you because you're self-interested and only looking to the self-interest of yourself i'm declaring that i've got a church of men who have not only a vision for themself a vision for their wives a vision for their family but they have a vision for the kingdom of god and they see something greater on the inside of them that they could never do of themselves and so it's freaking you out because your understanding vision is bigger than the insight that i see of the resources that i have but what god is going to use you to do i'm just declaring and prophesying over somebody's life that what god is going to do in your life and what god is going to speak over your life you don't have the wherewithal to do you weren't taught to do it you didn't have the great example to do it you don't have the degree to do it but the bible says there's something written in the word of god that says something that no eye has seen and no ear has heard and no mind has conceived that god has for those who love them do i have any people in here that love god and say i'm willing to trust you outside of my comfort zone outside of the ordinary i'll trust you i'll be everything you've called me to be we have no time to waste it's no time wasted and i want to speak three things to you today that i believe can help you as you pursue being a man and woman of god of wisdom in understanding the time one of the first things i want you to understand is you have not been called to live from regret point number one don't live from regret stop living from what you should have done living out of the should have will keep you locked into your past it will keep you with the emotions of your past as they are current to today and what you should have left behind and what you should have been healed from will operate as a present condition to who you are not realizing that your emotions of caring should be your emotions of your past i need you to stop operating out of your regret i need you to stop living out of saying to yourself i wish i would have done do you all know how many things i wish i would have done but the reality is is that i can't change it just tell your neighbor you can't change your past so stop living from regret stop living out your marriage from regret i wish i would have if i would have known if i could have the problem is you didn't know or you ignored it you saw it or you were desperate and you made the decision to do it anyway so here's the thing in order to see the best result you've got to stop living out of the regret says i want you to read this and i want you to go back home and you need to jot this scripture down it's philippians chapter 3 verse 12 through 14. i want you to jot that down go back highlight it in your bible get that thing in your spirit it says this for i have not yet reached my goal paul is speaking to the church in philippi i haven't gotten there and i want to let you know anybody that tells you they're there they're lying i haven't reached it i haven't done everything i'm supposed to i i haven't obtained i haven't killed it like i'll keep telling my storyline don't always equate with my current circumstance i haven't reached my goal and i am not perfect can i get an amen right there it says this but christ has taken a hold of me see that's the difference i want to let you know today i look like i do i feel like i do i'm operating like i do i got swag like i do because christ got a hold of me i don't take any of the credit but i recognize today that christ got a hold of me and so what i won't do is live in my past regret because when christ got a hold of me he changed me no i'm not perfect no i haven't reached all my goals but christ got a hold of me so he says this so i keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize pastor nobody told me there was a prize there's a prize at the end of this it's not a car it's not gucci shoes it's not a five bedroom but the bible says he is preparing a place for me and when my time is up i want to make sure i get the keys to where i'm going he says so i keep on running and struggling to take a hold of the prize he says my friends i don't feel i have already arrived can i tell you today sometimes you don't feel like who god says you are sometimes you don't feel like the promise that god said over your life he said but i forget somebody say forget y'all know we got that amnesia we got we got that we got that amnesia that we like to use when we want to i didn't see your text you have an apple watch on what are you talking about i'm sorry i missed it it says this that i forget what somebody said behind he says and i struggle ooh cause we thought it was easy he said i struggle for what nobody ever told you it was going to be a struggle which means stop looking and acting like everything's always perfect how's the marriage today it's always bliss and wonderful it's always so grateful for him so he's so wonderful ain't nothing like a father's day to see how that marriage went baby what you get me you love this tie right no no i don't if i can be honest no no i don't like this time it's horrible i have nothing to match with it then you start to say to one another i don't know if i like you and you turn to other pace and say i don't know if i like you either but you know what it says right here i struggle for what's ahead because i ain't going nowhere if you're married just tell your spouse real quick i ain't going nowhere so i'll struggle for what's ahead i'll do what needs to be done he says this i'll run somebody say i'll run i run toward the goal so i can win the prize of being called to heaven this is in case nobody told you what the prize is this is the prize god offers because of what christ not will do not should do but what christ has done and that thing is already settled in heaven so i'm struggling towards it when i don't feel like it i'm struggling towards it when i'm staying in it i'm struggling towards it when i feel all hope is lost i'm struggling towards it why because there's a prize [Music] that god offers because of what christ already has done we might be struggling to get there but we're getting there we we may have made a mistake but we getting there we've already made a decision i'm not going to keep referring to my past i'm not going to keep allowing my past to dictate where i'm going i'm not going to keep watching what's behind me i am free thank the lord i am free and if you're not then get free [Music] it's only from from regret point number two don't waste today can i can i just tell you real quick don't don't waste today don't mess it don't oh my lord don't don't you waste today thinking about tomorrow and trying to consider what happened yesterday you've got today somebody say today whatever needs to happen today i need god to do something today i'm going to use every part of today to get what i need from god to get today because if i'm day behind y'all know that puts me behind anybody ever been there before those of us that you read your devotional app your bible app and you miss like two days and nothing let you know you have missed days now you're what behind y'all know what i do i do not go and read all of them i'll be like catch me up because what i'ma do today is read today too many of us are trying to catch up religiously we're trying to catch up religiously without working through the process of relationship of what god wants to do today i may not have gotten it yesterday but it don't mean i need a double up prayer for today i just need god to do what he needs to do with me somebody say today lord bless me today god moving me today god break the bondage of me today god do a loose singing meat today god take the yoke off today god clear my mind today god give me liberty today god heal me when today i don't need you to waste today worrying about yesterday god i need you to move today the scripture says in ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 through 16. i didn't write it paul wrote it to the church in ephesus i'm not saying this to you i'm just being able to relate it to you but here's what the scripture says y'all looking at it already i didn't say it but i will reiterate what paul said to the church in ephesus here's what he spoke he said not me act like people with good sense that's a scripture for you right there act like people with good sense and not like fools he says for these are evil times so he says so make every minute count i want to tell somebody in here who hasn't done well as a dad as a mom as an individual as a husband as a wife in the past you've looked at the moment and you're complaining that you didn't have it together in your past but today's an opportunity because it says the time is evil so don't waste it on the things that mean nothing don't waste a minute can i can i tell you stop connecting with people who don't know how to forgive and stop working with folk who got bad attitudes and stop working with people who lower your standard because you're lonely can can i tell you to make sense of your time can i tell you to get with people that challenge you i'ma put this out here to men we love hanging with people at our same level because we don't like being challenged as women too we don't like the challenge of what someone else may bring us because the idea is that if you challenge me then you're threatening me and the problem is is you don't understand the difference between threatening and pushing because some of us haven't had the male figure in our life to understand the difference between one who is supposed to be a mentor and one who threatens your manhood and so when someone pushes you you push back with anger and isolation because you don't know what it looks like to be fathered fathering means that you bring up the uncomfortable things so that there can be progress and movement in your life and the idea of it is today is that if you've never been fathered then what you do is shut down you get an attitude and you isolate yourself from whoever challenges you but the problem is is that you're in the same place you were some time before i'm here to challenge your idea to become a vision i'm here to challenge your finances to become generous i'm here to challenge you so that you have a vision for your family not just a vision for your bank account i'm here to challenge you so that you know where you're taking your family and where they're supposed to be going i'm here today to challenge you for the work you didn't do as a dad in the beginning to man up and say it and do it now i'm here because i believe today that you don't want to waste and point number three somebody say number three can't this is a big one y'all some of us are petrified about tomorrow and point number three is don't worry about tomorrow i think we've interpreted this scripture wrong jesus is speaking in matthew chapter 6 verse 34 and he says this he says don't worry about tomorrow it will take care of itself it says you have enough wary about somebody say today some of us don't even know what we eating today we're worried about tomorrow here here's where i want to bring the clarity to you here here's where i want to help you really really quickly is that when the scripture says don't worry about tomorrow it does not say don't plan for tomorrow wary means the state of anxiety where emotion controls the outcome and decision of what you're going to do instead of the state of understanding of what should be done it says don't worry stop losing sleep stop finding yourself in a place where you don't have clarity or understand he says stop worrying about tomorrow just tell your neighbor real quick stop wearing you have enough problems for today you got enough going on today you got enough to think about today you can plan for what's ahead but it says stop wearing well you know i got to make this and if i do this if i don't get this thing i lose that credit and if i lose that credit i can't get that and if i don't get that then i don't get in and i don't get the job that i'm supposed to get and god says you forgot your life was already planned out so it was never on how efficient you ran it it was all about you understanding the purpose i called you to and if you understand i've called you to a purpose he says and that purpose can be fulfilled in your life today don't worry stop being anxious stop trying to control because that's what it is at the end of the day it is a controlling factor i gotta control it i gotta have it i gotta do xyz i gotta make sure this is happening i gotta take this opportunity and make sure i got all the ducks in a row can i tell you something and just speak to your spirit real quick you are okay where you are you're just not settling for where you are [Music] stop worrying some of us spend more time in our retirement in our savings account and our stocks and the things that we want of this world [Music] than we do in the word of god so we have no peace and we don't know that the word of god says there's a peace that goes beyond all of our understanding can i tell you today that while i'm planning for my future i'm considering my today why because my choice for today impacts what happens for my future you got to do something about today worrying about tomorrow ain't going to get you the results that you need to see for tomorrow it's about taking care of somebody say today i'm praying right now that there would be a freedom today in the house i pray right now that there will be vision in the house for god's people i pray right now that there will be an understanding and clarity i pray right now that you would have a moment of clarity to understand i'm not going to waste any more time but i'm going to do something about the moment that i have right now today where i'm going today what i'm doing today i won't wear it i'll plan but i won't wear it i'll plan i'll pray over it i'll pray over my plans i'll take god take my ideas and take him into vision but i won't worry about tomorrow because today has enough worries for itself i pray that god's peace be upon your life [Music] that you would stop controlling the moment and start allowing the holy spirit to direct you where you're going let me speak this out here you did not get where you are on your own it was by the grace of god [Music] he did it so how about you trust him to do it further today he says it if you can just lay your worry down cast aside these burdens in these jokes lay them on me for my yoke is easy am i burning this light and i'll take care of you today just like i took care of you yesterday and today i'm believing that god wants to do a new thing in us no time
