[Music] listen i am i'm speaking this over somebody today there is just no use in going back sometimes i believe in life where we find ourselves in a lost state at a place where uh we have certain sections of our lives together but the entirety of our lives or the completion of our lives are is not at a a full sustaining momentum we we find that good is happening over here but we're a little bit disrupted over in this area and we're just trying to find out how can i get back to the place that i need to be in life some of us are even trying to find a new set of steps a new route in which to walk in in life we are feeling a sense of unease of feeling a sense of loss of purpose or destiny we are feeling a sense that there is something missing in our lives it's not money it is not houses it is not cars it is not luxury things it is not even people but we understand that something in our hearts and in our spirits are missing i don't know if you've ever been there before but you've had everything you've wanted to have you've bought everything you've wanted to buy you've had every individual you can you you have the children you have the spouse you have everything that you've been praying for but yet there is still something that's missing on the inside of our lives and i don't know if you've ever walked in that place before but i want to let you know today that you're not alone in being in this moment and i think in the last two years many of us have been pondering and considering uh where we are in the current state of where life is who am i what am i doing where am i going how is life going to take me i don't know what my future looks like but some of us have found ourselves at just a pause in life trying to regroup so that we have an understanding and clarity of where we're going the problem is is that when i don't know what's ahead of me i tend to look more at what's behind me and when i look at what's behind me i tend to begin to reach out for the old me that i used to be the things that used to entertain me the things that used to be able to give me some sense of idea and purpose even though i praise god for a new season oftentimes i find myself running back to an old one and today i want to talk about what it looks like to not go back sometimes we want to go back and sometimes we have to look backwards in order to recover or to see things that we have not seen before one one time i'll never forget it was in the beginning of our marriage that my wife and i and our family had all went to florida and and we had a good time in florida can i can i tell you we we we enjoy going to the amusement parks and we enjoy life but anybody knows sometimes i know you've uh uh i've seen this through covet when you're together and in close quarters for a long time things tend to begin to happen anybody know about that you find yourself in a place where you just love the person that's next to you but you would just like a little bit of somebody say space space and times is not because we don't love one another space is because i need the time to go back and collect myself collect my thoughts collect my my my way of thinking and i need the space in order to regroup to who i am because here's what i want to let you know even though i want to let you know this single and married folk you get married you still need some space to breathe somebody may not want to admit this but i i i need to i need to have a moment i need to regroup of who i am what god's called me to do what what god's called me to be a part of how how he's shaping my life together it's no it's no thing against you i just want to let you know it's i love you but i need a moment to find me well i'm trying to tell you we were in a one two maybe a two bedroom i don't know how many bedrooms i remember my parents were gracious enough to invite us down and as a family we stayed together but but then there just became moments where it was a little bit of friction i'll call it tension that was in the space and tension over and over unresolved or not spoken to can move from a sense of tension to a sense of arguments and we were early in our good old marriage nice and young in our 20s and trying to be able to love the lord god with all our heart all our mind and all our soul but the problem was is we just weren't loving each other well at the time we found ourselves in a place where on the way back we were driving back to baltimore now i don't know if you have ever tried to play the silent game before but it's a hard game when you're looking at about 12 hours of driving eventually somebody's got to say something to somebody the children are in the back feeling awkward talking about can we talk or is this not okay right now you're turning on your music singing your songs that are hopefully speaking to the person that you're in tension with and so you're putting on a select group of songs that speak to the way you feel now about who they are finding the song that says i can do this by myself you just looking for anything to be able to give you a little bit of clarity about how you feel in this moment without saying it directly i'm gonna be honest that's where i was i had the tendency to look at the moment we had gotten so angry and so frustrated and so young that i was looking at my ring i said i can't this is i can't do this god's so angry i'm going to tell you how i'm living my life y'all passed the vast ambassador had a little he had a little issue back in the day and and i said you know what and i and i put my ring in my pockets don't do that don't judge me i i don't need your collective judgment this place is like planet fitness no judgment zone so i share my heart with you i take my ring off and i put it in my pocket the problem is is that i don't have deep pockets and i didn't think about that at the time we stop at the gas station and we get gas and i don't have my ring on but about midway i i get the gas said get back in the car and in midway in the travel you eventually find out you've got to talk and so we start talking and life starts to get back to a normal place but the problem is is when you make decisions in your feelings you can suffer the consequences in your moments when things have gone back to the way they're supposed to be and you find out that your decision in the heat of the moment isn't what was best for the future to come well when i got home everything was all right we were all good yeah it was that's right thank you i appreciate that because everyone judged me when i took it off but no one gave me praise on getting it back together so i appreciate you right there sir we're gonna keep on with this message and so by the time we got home i noticed within a couple of days anybody know about the pack oh man where is my ring i start searching and looking going through my pants going through all of my luggage and i cannot find it and i've got to come to the place where i have to own back up to the decision that i made when i was feeling emotional in the way that i was for a season that i was no longer in and i had to be able to face because the thing of life is is that you have to keep moving in life and you also have to deal with where you are and the way things are being held i said to myself well i got to tell my wife about this but i want to tell her at a good time so i wanted to make sure everything was light and wonderful i wanted to make sure i had brought flowers home that day and if candies were needed i'll do that too and i set the condition up right so that when i would deliver this news i would be okay i told my wife and she said um look at you now if i hadn't done that i said listen here all right it's no need for you to go back and forth i know what i've done i've come to admit it only because i lost it and i'm here to let you know i'm sorry god bless she got me another ring um yeah see i i like him the rest of you i'm going to preach online you know what i i need somebody to celebrate my decisions afterwards all right i get back to the place and i've got the ring on and and and and she bought me a new ring and i feel grateful but the problem often times in life is that i feel like what i've done is is a repeated pattern is that we make decisions and the emotional moments of life that have lasting impact on the future that god has intended for our lives and when we find ourselves in those places we don't know how to get forward so what we make the decision to do is to go backwards because it's easier to go back than it is to move past anybody know that to be true anybody know it's hard to end the argument when you're in the kitchen and you're walking past one another but you're acting like you're not speaking to anybody no it's always easier to stay in your mess than it is to get over it and get ahead and today i'm here today to let you know what's so important is the fact that i want to let you know there's no use in going back in the scripture we find in john 21 this moment where god has allowed the disciples to experience jesus's coming back and he appears to them in different times at different places and this is an incident of him visiting them and the bible lets us know that that he's visited them but here's the problem is that they're at the point in life where they're saying to themselves we don't know what to do after what has just occurred what's just occurred jesus died on the cross all of his disciples as we learned did what fled they left they all went their own way and how do you get back from the state of when you have left the savior by himself in the midst of conflict and brokenness how do we get back to the place where we use to be and i want to speak this today because so many of us find ourselves in the place where we're trying to figure out how can i move forward how do i move forward where i am where i feel stuff where life did not work out the way i thought it was where i made some decisions that i thought were good but they feel have me feeling unaccomplished they have me feeling insecure they have me feeling like i'm a failure i'm here today to let you know you can move forward but you don't have an option to move back and i want to tell you this because if you go backwards then it means that you didn't really learn from what you just came out of because it's become an option for you to get back to where you used to be and i i'm here today to let you know is that god establish and did things in your life not for you just to see something brand new but for you to understand he has a destiny set over your life [Music] the bible lets us know that that peter and and thomas and and and and the sons of zebedee james and john and and and then the other john are with peter and peter is in an unfamiliar place because while he has seen jesus back and forth can i tell you he feels a certain way because he knows he denied him after three years of following him and he also knows that he's not sure of how the relationship is anybody ever know where you in a relationship with anybody but y'all had a little argument and you don't know where everything stands in the moment so you start you start easing into the relationship hey how you doing you good you know you you start trying to slide back in you you don't really have good conversation because you'll you don't want to be what rejected and you thought hey how's it going we good everything's still all right awesome you want to go out okay too early that's too early all right that's all right i understand we're going to ease it back i got you that's all right that's cool i can wait i'm all right with it and you find peter probably easing himself back in but the problem was jesus wasn't staying with them like he was before he was in and out he was moving peter was so used to jesus being there every day and every moment but now there seemed to be distance and i'm gonna tell somebody today you're you've gone through this year and there's somewhat of a distance maybe between you and god it's not that you don't see him know him or recognize him it's just that you've seen that there's a little bit of distance between me and god and i'm here today to let you know that the distance that you see doesn't have to be the way that it is and i'm saying this today to you because peter is letting us know that that oftentimes we get in this state and we tend to go back to what we used to do in luke chapter 5 you'll find peter on the boat with his brother andrew and they're both in the place where they're looking to fish and as they're fishing they've been fishing all night and they get back to shore in the morning and they begin to clean their nets and they and they begin to dock the boat and they begin to get back to life as normal but jesus interrupts their life i don't know if you remember the first time jesus interrupted your life anybody remember that remember when he got a hold of your heart remember when he when when he when he intervened in your life in a way that you you didn't even understand you begin to feel something on the inside that began to change you and and freedom began to be released in your life and life began to change that was luke chapter 5 when when peter encountered jesus and and jesus did a miracle for him in peter's inconvenience he he said peter i need you to take me back out on the on the boat and peter said lord you know basically i'll do it because you're the rabbi but but but but i've already put up my nets and i've already cleaned the boat up and uh i've already put things back in the place he said if you just take the boat out i promise you i have something that's going to impact your life and the bible lets us know that he takes them in luke chapter 5 and he and and he tells peter to go out and he says peter cast your net and he's like lord we haven't caught anything all night and i just want to be clear with you is that i'm a fisherman and i know how to fish and i know how to guide my life and do what's needed but i just need you to know i'll do it because you're a good teacher the bible lets us know that that in the state that we're we're in that that peter goes and he casts his net and the bible says he cast his net to such a place that when peter cast it he brings in so much fish that the nets almost breathe three years later peter finds himself at at odds with himself unsure of what he's doing unsure where he's going unsure of his future he left everything to follow jesus but now he doesn't know where he sits with the savior and the bible says that peter finds himself back at the same point again you know what i don't know what else to do won't i just go back to what i remember doing and the bible says that peter goes back to fishing not being a fisher of men but a fisherman and he goes back and the bible lets us know that he's out all night just like that time three years ago he's out all night trying to fish but he cannot find anything as he's beginning the bible says as the day breaks it says that peter finds himself at a place where they're just probably like life is back to normal it's back to the old way i want to help you break a mentality right now that the bible lets us know that we can get into that life is no longer back to normal and you can't go back to the old you you used to be if you go back to the old you you used to be you don't get an opportunity to see the moments and remember what the lord has done what you've got to remember since the old you and the new you is that god has done a lot in the in between you've seen him use you to change water into why you seen him walk past coffins and lay hands and and those who are dead rise again you've seen him speak to people inside of tombs and people remove tombs and mummies walk out you've seen him do miracles as he walked down the street and gave hearing to those that were deaf and gave sight to those that were blind and lifted up the crippled and they walked again how can you refute that god has done something in your life i don't know if you understand but the new state of where you are the new level of condition of where you are the new mindset that you don't quit anymore it's all because of what you've experienced since your encounter with god and the moment that you're in right now and what i want to speak to somebody is don't let the state of where you are now or the unfamiliarity of where you're going be a thing in your head in your mind that keeps you from going to where god is called for you to go don't you allow for it to be the sustaining factor that keeps you at a place where you forget the way in which god delivered you the way in which god healed you the way in which god restored you the way in which god bless you the way in which god brought you out and delivered you don't you forget what the lord has done he's done some great things he's fulfilled his promise he's done what he said he would do don't you allow the dissatisfaction of the moment that you're in take you back to an old you that you don't even want to go back to and i'm saying that to somebody today because you're in the limber place of unfamiliarity and we always desire to be in a familiar state and a familiar place so that we know how to control the subset of circumstances that we're living in but here's what i want to let you know today there's a possibility that you don't have any control over the moment but it doesn't mean that god isn't in full control i want to define it over someone's life who's believing at the moment that the only thing that they have to do is go back is to move back it's to go back to what they used to be here's what i want to let you know today is that god is calling you to move forward even though you may be standing still even though you don't have a way to get to the next season i want to let you know you just wait on the lord and be of good carriage and the bible says while you're waiting he'll strengthen your hearts i want to preach that to someone today i want to teach that to someone today because it's important that you know that the unfamiliarity is the space where faith is kicking in it's the face where god allows you to allow what you've been speaking to now come into action because the bible says faith without works is dead so the still place is the place where your faith becomes active and i'm trying to preach it to somebody in here and i want to say it to you because you're in in the unfamiliar state and the enemy is telling you to go back to where you were what you don't remember is that when god delivered you out of where you are out of your egypt you don't remember the way they used to treat you back then you don't remember the anxiety that you were dealing with you don't remember the night sweats that you used to have you don't remember sitting in the alley feeling lonely all by yourself you don't remember praying and crying and every evening you don't remember the moments when you didn't have your mind together you don't remember the anxiety that you felt over and over but i'm here today to let you know god says you can't go back to where you used to be you can't go back to where you used to be you can't go back to that state of mind you can't go back to that way of living you can't go back to that financial state i won't go back i can't go back it's nothing back there for me [Applause] i want to speak this to somebody today there's no use in going back what you think you're going to obtain out of the thoughts of familiarity will only frustrate you in the very moment that you accept that going back is an option you may not know what you're doing right now in this season i talked about that on uh on friday you may not know what the plan is but god already has the plan in order don't go back don't pick up what you were doing before don't don't don't go into the dm in the inbox finding familiarity from what god has delivered you from because the things that god has delivered you from can be the things that you go back and regenerate from what he's done in your life i want to declare this over you right now some of you are in a state of temptation that you are so tempted to go back and god has actually delivered you all you're experiencing is your breakthrough in healing of what god is doing here's what i want to let you know there's something about coming through it and there's something about god delivering you from it but in deliverance there must be healing in deliverance there's got to be healing why because i can be delivered from something yet still hurting from its effects and if i don't walk in healing of what god's called me to do it will always call after me and have a sense of control because i haven't received my healing from it i want to speak this to you today because it's important that you know that god is calling for you but the lord is calling when he wants to call the bible lets us know that jesus already knew where his disciples were he knew their state of mind that's why he was already planted where he was on the shore waiting for them i want to tell you today that god is not absent he's just waiting on you god is not absent he is just waiting for you to get to where he is he is calling for you to be the individual in whom in your lost state you still got to say for god i live and for god i die [Music] it'll keep you in between every variant that comes out every new sickness every new devastation where we go from terrorism where we go from covid where we go from the state of the world being in a broken state i want to tell you today life will not stop but when you have god on your side you will stop wavering in who you are when life hits [Music] the bible says when peter heard it was jesus for jesus called to shore and he said to them children he had to bring them back into the state because oftentimes when we go backwards we go into an infant-style way of living and thinking because we're no longer taking responsibility for who we are we're letting our circumstances make us responsible for what we do and so now we find ourselves going back saying well if this is just the way it happens or this is just the way that it is or this is just the way that how we act and it's just like no no no no no no no god's calling you to something greater the bible says while he's while he's tinkling around with his with his old ways it says jesus calls him he says children now i'm going to lie to you if if if if if you're from baltimore none of us is turning around when someone yells out children you know one of the most offensive things you can say is hey little boy i know they ain't talking to me don't something rise up in you i know i know i'm not even turning around i know they're not talking to me but at times even an offense we still need to be okay with moving see most of us stop at a fence and don't go any further than where we are the bible says jesus called them children that's all right what instructions are you giving me because even if i'm offended right now i won't let offense stop my blessing [Music] my question is is how many times have you allowed someone offending you to stop the blessing that god has for you because you could not handle the set of circumstances that were before you he says to them children do you have anything to eat do you have any fish and it says and they answered them no we don't even know who that is but there's a possibility i think that it could have been this collective of you think could that could that be look i'm can i share something with you real quick in in my time of prayer most people get a word for everybody else when i pray and read my word god is giving me a word for me and the word for me isn't always about how much he's blessing me sometimes in my devotions god is reminding me that he already spoke a word i just haven't moved sometimes when when when i'm in my word god is reminding me that the decision that i have made and where i am going he's not okay with it he just wanted to let me know that he's not blessing it or okaying it so just in case i wanted to keep praying over and over i should probably let that go because god says i haven't attached myself with it here's what i'm saying most of my time with god is not about him pumping me up but him changing my life and speaking truth so that even in my deliverance i'm healed for the bible says and if you know the truth the truth shall what set you free [Music] if god spoke more truth in your life that you were able to receive you would have more freedom in your life than waiting on someone else to free you with their decisions i don't need i don't need a ton of friends to tell me the truth because god does that already at the top of the day father i just would like to know uh today i feel great um just asking for forgiveness of my sins um you want to run through them nope i i thought we would gloss over them and just get a covering of forgiveness and god will walk me through them he says because here's what i want to let you know if you don't know them then you don't know how to be delivered or know that you're delivered from them so there are oftentimes where god walks through my mishaps when i thought oh i killed it today i'm not oh man that's devotion time with me god cover my sins i'm good to go lord says no no no back up before we get to thanksgiving let's get back here let's acknowledge that thought that you had that you've had a couple times that you've given no attention to which is keeping you from truly walking in the destiny that i've called you to because that seed is somewhere on the inside that i need to uproot that's devotion not just a good message a good scripture to read for the day it's a life that's built on transformation so if your devotion isn't changing you it means that it's not devoted to you because a devotion that's devoted to you is going to change you so stop being comfortable with just reading a word and start being comfortable with the word reading you at three points that i want you to understand why you don't have the ability to be able to go back the first point i want you to get this is just really quick is that you can't go back because you've changed and you're not recognizing it because you still see old remnants of yourself but what i want to tell you is that if you've accepted the lord jesus christ as your savior into your heart right there you've changed now the first display that we're often looking at is a change in our actions but the problem that we don't understand is that that's a process that we walk through with the power of the holy spirit and the power of the holy spirit leads us to be able to live out the new us that's on the inside to see the change that god wants to do and so the change that god wants to do is not just out of your salvation for he changes your state of eternity from you being one pointed into the direction of eternal hell to one being pointed into the direction of eternity with him but through that now through what baptism the shedding of one's old self we are empowered through him who is the holy spirit that gives us the power to see the change in action that first happens with the change in heart he changes our heart and with our heart our actions change the bible says in galatians 2 and 20 it says my old identity has been co-crucified with christ and no longer lives and now the essence of this new life is no longer mine that's why you can't go back because it's no even longer yours now it says for the anointed one lives his life through me we live in union somebody say as one my new life is empowered by the faith of the son of god who loves me so much that he gave himself for me dispensing his life into minds so the life that i now live i live out of the faith of the son of god because he's poured his life into mind that's where we see the power and evidence of the holy spirit operating on the inside of us because he is now in me why can't you go back because you've changed you can't go back to what you used to do because you've changed you told god i recognize my sin i recognize my brokenness i recognize that i need your help so i recognize i have changed somebody say this i've changed you don't feel it you know it i've changed you've got to declare it over yourself when you're tempted to go back to what you used to be i've changed i don't feel it right now and i understand that what god is doing on the inside of me is not about my feelings it's about what he's doing spiritually that's changing my heart and that's changing my mind so i understand i've changed and i can't go back to the old me that i use to be i've changed the second thing i want you to know why you can't go back is because you've seen more when you see more you've got to change what you've done you know some of us hadn't seen nothing we hadn't seen a possible new us we hadn't seen a delivered us we hadn't seen and healed us we hadn't seen us in our right minds we hadn't seen us thinking and having a perspective the way that we have and so we have learned some things in this last year we have grown some ways in this last year we have put up with some things we would normally put up with in this last year we've forgiven some folk we would never have forgotten this last year and we find ourselves in a place looking at a different set of us can i tell you some of you have been pushing through and you're saying pastor i'm tired but here's what i'm saying last year you would have quit this year you seen a new you that won't quit so what i need you to know is that you seem too much to go back you seem too much to go back to where you are god is showing you too much for you to end up in the space you used to be god is connecting you the people that are telling you too much and trying to give you too much information and you're saying lord i don't even understand what they're saying he's saying what i'm doing is overloading you with vision and direction so you don't have an excuse to go back to what you used to i'm trying to tell you this why because there's something ringing in your heart when you try to go backwards that reminds you remember when pastor marcus said i've changed even though i didn't change i don't feel like it but he said god was doing something in me i know better now so i act differently now can i tell somebody in this new coming year you'll see a different year when you see a different you i want my year to change then you change i want my relationship to change then you change i want my finances to change then you change how you're giving and how you're spending and put your priorities in the right place but it will not change because of the way you just think it in your mind it will change because of the application of your faith in the times when you don't even know what god is saying for you to do he's teaching you so that in the quiet moments you still have a word to go off of psalms 37 and 25 says i've been young now i'm old don't just take this in the idea of age but you're different in age than you were last year you you were you were you were young every day were getting older no matter if you're one no matter if you're 99 you were young but you're getting older and it says yet in the time over this year i have yet to see the righteous forsaken it says nor his descendants begging bread what have you learned over the last couple of months that has taught you that god does not forsake those in whom he loves you seem too much for you to go back to where you used to be don't you relent this moment to what you feel but you stay right where you are because you've seen him do it before and if he could do it before he'll do it again and point number three the reason why you can't go back is because your expectations are different i just i gotta i have a different level of expectation of what god is going to do in my life my expectations for what i'm going to see for my family for what i'm going to see for my life for what i want to see for my finances for what i want to see for my spiritual walk i just believe i've seen too much for me to rest that where i am can i tell you today you're not too old to change and you're not too young to start making a move i want to speak it because god is saying if i still have you here on this earth i have a destiny a purpose and a plan for your life your expectations are different here's how i can help you by the time we get to new year's eve i want you to write down what you're expecting god to do in your life in this new year if you haven't written an expectation plan then you have nothing to look forward to you'll just accept the day as it comes but what are you looking for in your family what are you looking for from your children what are you expecting from your relationship can i tell you today if you could write that thing out you would have something to pray for when we get to 21 days of prayer and fasting on january the 9th and i'm here today to let you know you'll see god do exceeding and abundantly above all that you could ask a thing the scripture says in hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 he says let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering because the one who made the promises is reliable if you haven't written a note if you haven't kept the thought i want you to just have one thing in your mind my god is reliable i may can't rely on anybody else i may can't rely on what anyone else says you may can't rely on what someone else says they were going to give you i just want to let you know today whatever god has promised over your life it is reliable the bible says it is a yes and an amen when times get hard just remember god said yes and amen whatever he promised you god said yes and amen whatever he spoke over your children is yes and amen over my marriage yes and amen over my life yes and amen and he will do what he said he would do i want to speak over someone's life today just to let you know there's no use in going back
