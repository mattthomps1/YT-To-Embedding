[Music] thank you [Music] foreign good morning World Changers happy Sunday I am Nishi and this is mixed kids do you remember who we are that's right we are a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world we are happy to bring you all fun and exciting ways to know God our hope is that you would share God's love with your friends and your family do we have any World Changers watching or visiting for the very first time welcome we are so happy that you decided to join us today this month our theme is back to school back to Faith last week we talked about how going back to school can be a bit scary this week we are going to talk about how God looks at our heart when we go to school we see different types of people short tall long hair short hair and a variety of skin tones but it is not about how we look on the outside but what we look like in the inside we often judge people by the way that they look on the outside we really can't tell a lot about a person by just looking at them do you know what God looks at when he sees us that's right God looks at our hearts I had this lovely container would you rather have this container or what's inside of it looking at the outside of this container doesn't show us what's inside let's open the container and see what's inside yum I know these are one of my favorite snacks see containers are important but not as important as what they hold inside just like this container we look great on the outside which is important but what's most important is what we have on the inside you guessed it right our heart let's look at a video that talks a little bit more about why it's important to care more about what's on the inside rather than what's on the outside take a look what's on the inside is way more important than what's on the outside [Music] hey guys it's me again Douglas and today I wanted to talk to you guys about a concept that I think most of us you know we know we know this concept but we don't really understand it right we don't really live it out and that is the idea that that it's what's on the inside that's most important not on the outside right and like I said I think most of us know this but we don't really live it out like if I was to go downstairs right now and get the garbage bag out of the trash can in my kitchen and bring that bag up to you and say hey would you like this bag of garbage you'd probably be like um no thank you Douglas I do not want a bag of garbage but then if I was like oh no but what if I put this bag of garbage into a nice box and wrapped it up like a Christmas present would you like it then your answer would probably be the same right because it doesn't matter if you put Christmas wrapping paper over it it's still going to be a bunch of garbage that makes sense right but as people we have such a hard time with how things look right we get so obsessed with how things look even if we know we shouldn't like the other day I was at school and we were in the gym and I was looking around and I realized that just about everybody in the gym had the same brand of shoes and it wasn't the same brand as my shoes and let me start off by saying that my shoes are just fine but in that moment when I looked around and I saw that everybody had different shoes than me I got this like nasty warm feeling in my chest and in my face and I felt like I felt like I had to get those shoes I had to get the shoes so I could look just like everybody else and it's not like getting those new shoes would make me any different right I'm still Douglas but deep down I felt like I needed those shoes for people to like me and it's not just with shoes right it seems like we do this with just about everything that you can see we judge ourselves we judge other people you know if you're small you feel like you should be big and if you're big you feel like you should be small and people feel like their hair is the wrong color their Skin's the wrong color and and worse yet they judge other people for these things too that's pretty messed up because the truth is that this external stuff this stuff on the outside really doesn't matter very much it's all about what's in your heart you know in the Bible it says that people might look at what's on the outside but God looks at your heart it is so much more important to work on your heart than to work on your physical appearance and so that can be really encouraging you know maybe you're not the kind of person who who always has the right clothes or maybe you don't feel like you look like everybody else because God doesn't care about all that stuff God cares about your heart and even people when it comes right down to it they care about that too if your friends only care about you so long as you look a certain way you need new friends those aren't good friends and so my challenge to you guys today is that you would look at things like God does that you would care more about what's on the inside than on the outside both in yourself and in other people don't judge people by how they look including yourself God looks at the heart so let's not judge ourselves based on how we look and let's certainly not judge other people based on how they look it's what's on the inside that counts we have all had times when we felt like Douglas some of us may want to be taller or shorter or faster or stronger or even have the most popular shoes cell phones or game system but let's remember to look at ourselves and others the same way that God looks at us let's look at the inside and worry less about the outside now it's time for this week's memory verse let's say it together humans are satisfied with whatever looks good God probes for what is good Proverbs 16 and 2. before we go
