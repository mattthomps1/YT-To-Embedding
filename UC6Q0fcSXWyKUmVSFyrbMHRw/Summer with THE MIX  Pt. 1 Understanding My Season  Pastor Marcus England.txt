[Music] can we jump into the word of god well you know what we got to do we got to open our bibles open our notes get your phones out it's a phenomenal time to be able to take notes and reading god's word here in the mix we say that readers are what and note-takers are what so you are a leader and you are a world changer and we're ready to get into the word of god summer at the mix is so many different topics i'll begin to talk about and i'm excited to talk about this and so uh we're gonna jump into job chapter 23 verse three and we're going to go to verse 10 and i'm going to be able to read and just break down what god has placed on my heart job is finding himself at a place where life was going amazing healthy family he was wealthy he had all the things that you could expect in life from a godly man joe was so good that he understood more than most parents do that his children were probably bad and the bible says he made sacrifices for him because he knew they was out there doing some crazy stuff job said i gotta i gotta i gotta put in i gotta put instead for my children because i know they out there acting up and job the bible says he was a righteous man but the bible says that tragedy hit job's life job lost his kids job lost his family he had his wife left in him and the enemy had gotten to such a place that he impacted job's health and the play that we find ourself in is that job is sitting with his friends and he's walking through the process of why life has happened to him anybody ever been there before that you're trying to figure out why you are at the place you are in life why are things happening the way they are around you and to you and you cannot figure it out and job is in this place with his family and he's talking this out with some friends and he's trying to figure out lord why am i going through what i'm going through why are certain things happening in the world as we talked about that are happening today why anybody ever asked the lord the question why anybody ever been there before lord why as job goes through this process here's what i want to let you know god is not scared of your why so don't think you lose your space in heaven because you have some questioning moments of why god is doing what he's doing and why things are happening the way that they're happening but at the end of all of it god is trying to lead you to trust in him by faith no matter what the circumstances and no matter what happens he wants you to trust him by faith when we start at verse 3 job says oh that i knew where i might find him talking about god that i might come even to his seat he said i would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments [Music] i would know he would answer me and understand what he would say to me would he contend with me in the greatness of his power joe said no he would pay attention to me he said there an upright man could argue with him and i would be acquitted forever by my judge behold i go forward but he is not there anybody ever been there before you've been looking for god ahead of you but it doesn't seem like the lord is there he says and backwards but i do not you want to underline that part perceive because everything that you perceive is not necessarily what it is he said i do not perceive him but can i tell you on the left hand job said he's working [Music] can you just tell your neighbor real quick he's working [Music] can you tell somebody else on the other side just tell them real quick he's working he said on the left hand he's working he says i do not behold him he turns the right hand but i'm gonna let somebody know why god is working you won't see him [Music] but the bible says but he knows just tell your neighbor real quick he knows he knows the way i take me crazy me lose headed me [Music] mouthy me he knows the way i take he he understands me he knows where i doubt he knows where i question he knows where my faith is little he knows me [Music] he said but he knows me and the way that i take no matter the path that you find yourself in today he knew the way you would take but the bible says even in knowing the way that you would take when he's tried me if he's trying me then it means he knows what's going on with me and if he knows what's going on with me then what it speaks to is that he's still with me [Music] and if he's with me then the bible says that means he's never going to forsake me [Music] so it says when he's tried me you remember back in the day we used to tell somebody don't try me don't you mess with me you don't know where i came from but the bible says when he's tried you you won't just get aggravated angry you just won't be irritated you just won't walk out frustrated the bible says when he has tried you and you've walked through he says i shall come out as goat valuable indestructible worth something i didn't look like it when you found me but there's something about gold once there's pressure and once it's cleaned off you start to see that little gold thing in you you say there's some value there there's something worth there some he says when when you've tried me i'll come out as pure gold it doesn't matter what i'm going through it doesn't matter how much it hurts it doesn't matter that i don't understand when you have tried me i'll come out as goat i'm not going to jump to this other scripture but i want to come from this topic that we're going to talk about today i want to come from this understanding my season [Music] understanding my season it's so important for you to understand your season can we pray father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that we're commanding our hearts to be open our minds to be renewed in you we are praying today that whatever it is that you want to speak holy spirit have your way in jesus name we pray somebody say amen understanding my season it's an important concept for us to get today because if not our ambitions and life will put us on a track where we believe we are always dude the response and the answer and the request of prayer that we want to see in this moment i oftentimes want us to get that when we're before god there are some things that we begin to pray and ask the lord for but the bible lets us know that there are things that happen at the right time at the right moment at the right place and if i can say this to you very very quickly i want to welcome you those of you that are online my name is marcus england i am the lead pastor and i love you so as i am understanding that we all move into a a season of life somebody say the word season there's a season of life that you are in now whether you realize it or not there is a season that you are in in your life you are not mowing through life you are not just going through life you are in a season of your life here often times when we don't understand that our life is created and maintained in seasons where we lose our clarity and understanding is that we're expecting every moment of our life to be the same and the problem with that is is that life if i can inform you changes ah that word change anybody anybody kind of tense up when you hear the word change because you just don't really like change can anybody be honest in here you are not a changed person this is not what you do you don't look forward to it don't talk about it you know you only like change when change impacts your bank account you ain't got no problem with that one god give me a raise thank you lord i thank you that you do all things well god i praise you you get a promotion father you are excellent in all of your ways they take money off of the account god you are jehovah yahweh you don't even know what yahweh means god you are yahweh i heard pastor marcus say that so i like change when it's for the benefit but change when it's for the benefit because god is doing it but it seems like it's against me is not the change i'm looking for [Applause] and the problem is is that i will love change as long as i always land in the place that i want to be change man i tell you if somebody could tell us change was going to happen we would have felt better if somebody could have told us cole bid was going to change things we'd have been good all right i can plan i know what to do let me let me situate myself because i know this is about to happen here's the problem with god there is none the problem is with us let me tell you how god likes to work he likes to work in three ways he loves to give you a promise or vision about what you could be and where you could go everybody likes a promise man i'm excited i look good where god has taken me anybody know about that god give you a vision you start telling people i was dreaming last night [Applause] i saw myself you just start going through all of these you love god's promise is anybody i mean can we be honest about it i love god's promises do you not love god's promise we come to church and it's like you'll get freedom yes here's the problem i don't like the process because with promise comes a process and process isn't always fun oh man some of y'all like no no he said summer with the mix talking about joy peace and love i'm sorry though this is not a woodstock message this is a message of season because if you don't understand you won't be able to have joy even when things are going bad see if you understand your season you understand how to operate when you don't you get frustrated because the problem that i oftentimes have is that when i'm frustrated in the season it means that i haven't understood where i am let's let's talk about this a little bit further because there is this purpose and the season and the purpose is wrapped up in the season let me show you real quick ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 says this to everything there is a what a season a time for every what purpose under heaven great so here's the thing god gave you a promise but the promise has seasons and the promise has seasons because god needs to take you through process if anybody understands the children of israel they were brought out of captivity but before they got into the what promised land they had to go through the what wilderness anybody like wilderness what's wrong with wilderness it's dry it's hot like some of you are right now but the problem with christianity is like the children of israel is oftentimes where we want to be free we're not willing to walk through the process of transformation you can get to a place where you are no longer bound but anybody know just because you've been released from imprisonment doesn't mean your mind isn't still imprisoned [Applause] that's why when things happen in your life you come out of a relationship you lose a certain amount of money and you gain it back you repeat the same thing because while you have freedom from the situation you don't have freedom in your heart and your mind from the things that have you captive and if you don't understand the season what you'll operate out of is your emotions somebody say my emotions my emotions sometimes are all over the place they can be high they can be low they can be in places where you find yourself where you're complaining continuously about the things you should be grateful for you make more money to help more people but now you're complaining because every time you got to help somebody you weren't expecting it god is saying i'm trying to let you know there's seasons to what i'm doing in your life and the seasons that are in your life are going to require something from you in a way that you never understood that god wants to do something greater in your life than you could ever imagine the seasons see seasons are tricky because nine times out of ten you're always in a blessed season anybody know that season of blessing god just bless me you pray the prayer that we call the prayer of jabez you can go look that up and and the prayer of jabez is increase my territory and god says i will but you got to go through the wilderness before i can trust you with what i'm going to bless you with [Applause] and where i come to a broken place is that i don't like wilderness seasons i don't like process let me tell you the number reason number one reason i don't like process is because process takes too long anybody know that let me let me tell you about the process you didn't pray for patience everybody prays for it god give me patience patience is already inside of you god created you with patience it's the process of the seed of patients moving from potential to purpose so that means in a wilderness season in order to get patients you've got to go through trials because if you go through trials it teaches you how to build your patients your potential must be built we like things instantly and fast anybody know about instantly like how many of us have an air fryer everybody look at you every i live by it i threw my oven out we just got an air fryer in the hole it's just an air fryer in the hole you you know when i noticed it started getting disrespectful when people started frying chicken in the air fryer i said nope nope that flower needs to go in grease can't no air and flower work together to bring no crisp i looked at that thing i said it's disrespectful and it's not god's will and i won't be a part of that i'm not eating that chicken that chicken is not done [Applause] my wife opened it look at it it is done i said that is not god's way god requires fire for sacrifice [Music] if that bird gave his life then there needs to be fire [Applause] i wanna hear about no when king pass and cook the chicken i never heard that in scripture god sent the wind and the wind cooked the chicken no when the priest ate it it went to the altar and it was burned i need fire i'm sorry but we want things fast we want them a tour fast we want to break our addictions fast the things that we have been building in our life unconsciously the things that the enemy has been strategically planning since you were conceived since he knew you were even coming you're trying to get rid of it in a week and god is saying i can do the miracle in a week but the process of you getting it out of your mind and out of your heart is going to take time you need a wilderness season some of you are trying to break some bad relationship habits while getting in relationships god's like hey real quick you asked me to break it in order for me to break it i got to give you a season of rest you're telling jesus well i'm lonely and that's the problem the lord says your loneliness your emotions should not dictate to you the plan and the promise that i've already declared over your life because the promise is greater than what you feel in the wilderness if you could just get through it if you could just hold on if you could stop reverting back to us it's a mindset the children of israel said take us back to egypt there we had food there we had water but what your mind forgets is there you were abused you were revoked there you could never walk in your promise stop remembering egypt and your old self as something to glorify and get the understanding that god wants to bring you out of bondage but not only bring you out he wants to transform you but it's if you could understand that you're walking in seasons it's not just the promise it's the process but it's not just the process for the bible says when we are tried we shall come out as pure gold it's also about the promotion i don't want to leave you in the hang that you just go and sit there dry out dark cry and be like lord when am i ever getting out because here's the thing you cannot shorten your wilderness but you can lengthen it some of us are complaining to god because we've been in our process so long but the problem is is god said i i didn't call for it to be that long you weren't supposed to be going for 40 years this was only supposed to take a couple of days when i don't understand my season i don't understand what i need the way i need to be thinking the way i need to be acting because the idea that i go behind is the context that all god wants to do is punish me and god says i'm just trying to get you to the what promise and that promise moving to the promotion of where i've called you to so you're saying well pastor how do i understand how do i bring to clarity the season that i'm in well i'm glad you asked the first thing we must do which sounds very cliche-ish if you've gone to church for a long time but it is you must seek god i want you to add this word at the end diligently because the hiccup that i get is because i prayed once last week that i'm expecting the promise of god to be fulfilled and scripture gives me clarity that there is a responsibility on my end in order for me to understand the season that i'm in scripture says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 it says for he who comes to god must believe that he is and somebody say anne and that he is a rewarder of those who what diligently seek him that's why you have to be careful when people give you a word from god but they're not diligent seekers because you will seek for a promise that's not yours listen you can do coffee shop talk with your girlfriends and your homies but when it comes to your purpose you need to find some folk in your life that are diligently seeking god so that they can be able to pour something back into you outside of what they feel and what they think it's the question have you been with god lately seek god the bible says diligently and he shall reward you so you don't have to make up promises you don't have to make up promotions because you're disconnected from what the word of god says he says if you're rewarded because god told me god can't tell you if you're not a diligent seeker your emotions can tell you your church knowledge can tell you because you've been in church long enough to know how to manipulate and hear and to know the things to say but the problem is knowing what to say and seeing the promise in your life are two different things and the clarity and understanding is is that some of us are so stagnant and some of us are so fixated on certain things because we don't have a true promise in our life so we made up a promise here's the thing about your promise your promise is only about your gain why is god promising you something that's only for your benefit [Applause] let's talk about what that looks like everything you're doing is about your building your growth your financial increase your name everybody's seeing you more followers for you and god is saying i bless so that you can be a blessing that's what i do i give so you can just give it you're the pathway in which generosity flows not just financial generosity but the generosity of speaking well of others the generosity of pouring your life into other people i bless you so you can be a blessing not i bless you so you can keep blessing yourself over and over some of us none of our plans have anyone else in mind but us and here's where we try to leave it at we say it's our legacy and god says no it's your selfishness [Applause] because you don't understand your season because the season of self only lasts in the promise that god has something for me so i never try to walk through the process or the wilderness for god to change who i am so that i can become who he's called for me to be one of the best things that i ever saw about my life is when i stopped trying to keep what i got and i started to keep what i had and give it to somebody else what do you want to do my wife and i bought a house we prayed over the house declared the house what we say for the house how it's gonna be for other people other people to come in other people to be a part other people to be able to counsel other people to be able to talk to other people to be able and right now in this season where kovid has brought us so much to ourselves our space of being generous is that a small percentage well you know i don't want to get covet so so that's why you're not an impactful giver you know i don't you know i want to get too close to people you don't know how this thing really is is that why what you do with your life is not ministering to other people see god didn't call for us to be a non-profit organization to help people he called for us to be disciples to send people out so that the bible says their lives can be changed when you get to heaven god's not interested in your good god he's interested in your eternal impact [Applause] when we get the idea that we can seek god diligently the bible lets us know that we get a reward from that seeking he gives us a promise but that promise i'm gonna tell you is followed by a process i'm gonna deliver you thank you jesus but you're gonna go through wait wait a minute so like we gonna go all the way through we just go like partial through or like what does this feel like and god's saying whatever i'm about to do be excited about who you're about to become because i'm going to form you when you come out you'll be as pure gold the second thing i need you to understand is that as you're seeking god diligently god calls you to make sure that you choose you choose not to quit you have to choose not to quit not hope that you don't do it again you have to choose somebody say choose you must choose not to quit because if i choose it it means i'm making decisions the bible says i rather your yes be yes and your no be no it's in the indecisive place where you don't know where you're going that the enemy has the greatest ability to take a hold of your life because you've committed yourself to nothing you've committed yourself to nothing you want to join the church i mean you know i like it i like it people here are nice i just don't know yet god said just let your yes be yes and nobody know figure out what you're going to do so that you understand what you're committing yourself to because when you commit yourself to something you hold yourself to something when you hold yourself to something you live out intentionally when you live out intentionally you have a life that's filled with purpose when you do not know what you're going to do and i don't mean the exact job but when you understand that you have not established within your life through the promise that you're going to what choose not to quit every moment of discomfort is an opportunity for you to quit promise comes and means are you ready let's go he's like process you like you know what i'm done i'm done i'm not doing this some of you i want to be honest with you you come closer to jesus and it seems like things get worse won't admit that yeah like don't talk about jesus like that he is nice but the truth of the matter is you know why things happen so fast when you get saved because he's been waiting to start the process it's crazy at it you thought getting with jesus was about him doing what you wanted and he's got to get you out of your pride so he starts process real fast you're like lord i give you my heart cool you lost your job what the oh my god he's like i was trying to get you out of it anyway but you ain't hearing me so now you're giving your heart to me let's start the process and you're like this christian thing ain't working but nobody told you there was promise there was process and there was promotion and god starts quick and early and you're like i didn't mean no i'm not going to that church no more they lied no no no i didn't lie because there was a promise that in you knowing the truth that the truth would set you free but in order for the setting free to take place there's got to be a wilderness that you walk through where god is throwing truth at your life and you're ready to be able to accept it because in the acceptance can come change [Applause] and the whole time you thought god was against you he was like oh no i'm just ready to get you to who you were supposed to be often times we're wondering out about our purpose without caring about our process and we don't care about the season we're in we're just like god tell me what to do show me my purpose if god showed you your purpose you would flat out pass out you'd be like oh no i'm not do i'm not doing that no siree taking introverted people and putting them with people you would flip i'm not doing that don't put me around all them people it's covet jesus you know do people and he starts showing you pieces of you that don't look like you because what he wants to do is take the unseen things and make them seem in the unknown things and make them known and they unheard things and make them heard and there's some things you have not seen there's some things you don't know and there's some things you haven't heard about yourself that god is saying to you that don't look like the original plan you started with and if god shows you you and it looks different than the degree you've been fighting for for 99 years you are going to flip out so he's got to give you promise process promotion he says all right let's do it again another promise promise process promotion and he gets you in alignment with your purpose according to the seasonal work that he does not asking what is my purpose and god says this is what it is and you like i got it from here thanks it's not how it works he's like i'll give you a what promise say it with me process and then what a promotion and then he starts the process all over again so you keep asking well i'm always going through right because you got a lot of stuff and god's trying to expedite the time some of us god's redeeming your time but it's a longer wilderness process to get you to where you want to be because you waited out the time for him to do the work earlier so he's saying now wilderness gonna look a little long some of you god will give you a promise this year that won't happen until 10 years later you're like absolutely not i will not be on that that is way too long and god says and that's your problem because you don't want to wait to become you want to rush the process which has gotten you to where you are now full of things but empty of purpose driving the best but don't know where you're going living in the biggest but nobody's there for you to impact it's a lonely world to have all of god's promises for them not to make a difference in the world i'm here today to let you know you've got to understand your season last point somebody say last point no no no don't say it don't say it i got a scripture wait a minute galatians chapter 6 verse 9 says this so let's not allow ourselves to get fatigued doing good he says at the right time somebody say the right time say the right time say it again because y'all don't like that word because you think every time is the right time god's on your schedule that's how i think right time now lord's like no right time now no right time now lord no i just want to check again right tom no but the bible says at the right time somebody say we just turn to your neighbor real quick say we turn to your second neighbor say we third choice i know you're my third choice but this is talking about you too say we god is not blessing you by yourself and for you it is a we harvest if i go you go if i conquer you conquer if i'm successful at it you're successful at it if i know how to get it you know how to get it because it's a we harvest harvest has never been meant to be sown for one family when harvest is sown when there's a seed put in the ground when the ground is watered and when the ground is till the farmer goes out and pulls all of it up and says this portion is for us but the rest goes out [Applause] some of us are putting seed in the ground only to get our own harvest back and only to reap our own rewards and god says not so [Applause] this is not so you may get it on earth but you won't get it in heaven for thy will be done on earth some of the things that we have never came from heaven that's our stuff be like lord thank you for this god lord said i didn't send that no that's not me that's why you can't pay them payments my will is already dedicated to knowing who you are because my will is connected with the purpose of the season you're in i don't give you things so that in the process of it i can take it back because i don't work that way so i gotta make decisions and choose not to quit somebody say number three you must trust god to manifest his plan you must trust god not you trust god not you trust god not you trust god not you to manifest his plan somebody say his plan his plan is better than your plan even when it feels like you're losing out god says i have something greater and better for you his plan is always good it's always perfect his plan requires process but it always ends with a promotion the bible says in jeremiah chapter 17 verse 7 through 8 it says happy somebody say happy if you're weighted down by what you're trying to get i'm going to promise you today you are trying to be in control for the bible says happy [Music] are those who trust in the lord who rely on the lord they will be like trees planted by the streams the bible says whose roots reach down to the water they won't fear drought when it comes their leaves will remain cream [Music] scripture is saying life hits some of the hardest things will take place you won't see what you prayed for but because you are rooted and grounded [Music] it says they won't fear drought why because the lord of hosts is with them [Music] for the god of jacob that's what david said he's my refuge it says they won't fear drought when it comes and their leaves will remain green i'm not gonna look any different when the enemy comes in like a flood and tries to drown me out and i'll look the same when the spirit of the lord lifts a standard above me and gives me everything i need to be able to walk through the fire and not smell like what i've been through i'm here today to let you know he'll keep your mind in perfect peace those of us who have hearts and minds are stayed on him i'll be rooted i'll be grounded i won't be wavering back and forth and to and fro but i'll stay planted in the word and in the things of god though he slayed me job said yet will i trust him [Music] [Applause] i shall be planted though some things happen in my life i shall be planted [Music] though the enemy tries me i shall be planted take what you want tow it away move it take it out of my life but i'm planted i won't give up i won't quit i won't lure away my purpose and my promise i'll stay planted in the word of god though he slayed me yet will i trust them though things look hard yet will i seek after him though things are turning up i tell you i won't move i'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of living water [Music] i'm gonna lose some but i'm telling you i'm planted some things are going to hurt but i'm planted [Music] one thing my family will see is a man of god planted he didn't move he didn't move it got hard but he didn't move he's planted [Applause] [Music] everything that the enemy will throw at us will confront him in our wilderness but what we won't do is choose to go back won't go back i won't go back to egypt i won't go back to bondage there is nothing in this life that is worth going back i shall be like a tree planted you can take my kicks you can take my car you can take my money but i'm planted because the bible says whatever he takes when i come out i'll be as gold i'll be more valuable than i was before i may not have what i used to have but i'll be better than i was before now god has placed me in such a place i don't even need those things to define me anymore because i'm coming out as pure gold i know the value of who i am [Music] since they won't fear drought their leaves will remain green i want to speak this over somebody's life today it says that they won't be stressed i told our huddle team today i said the bible lets us know that jesus says my yoke is easy and my burdens are light some of you are so stressed out because you've become god for yourself thinking you have the answers and thinking you know the way and the lord is saying today i want you to take my yoke he didn't say you won't have a yoke and he didn't say you won't have a burden he said but my yoke is easy and my burdens are light so whatever it is you're fighting through whatever it is you're going through it's not that i stop what you're going through but i give you a place so that you can be happy because you're trusting in me he says they won't be stressed in the time [Music] he says and even when you're at your hardest place when you don't think you have anything to give god says the evidence that i'm with you is that you won't be stressed in the time of drought [Music] or you won't fail to bear fruit god is still going to do something even in the seasons where you feel all strength is gone [Music] he says you'll still bear fruit you'll still impact people you'll still give you'll still change lives when he's taking things away you'll still give that's the impact that looks so different it's when things are coming from me that i'm still yet giving things [Music] see we love to be generous when we have plenty [Music] but jesus says the wilderness and process that i'm taking you through it's going to make you into such a different person that when you come out even when it doesn't look the same when the account is not the same you're still going to be trying to figure out how do i give more how do i help more how do i do more how do i impact more [Music] because he says when i'm in you there'll be something happy because you've trusted in me i'm still here today to let you know you'll bear fruit and that fruit will bear more seed and that seed will bear more fruit and that fruit will bear more seed and more impact will be gap more impact will be got more impact yeah i'm using the king james word right there [Music] but it means the repetition of your impact i'ma say this real quick hold on musicians just give me this i wanna i wanna i just want to give this moment real quick so you can understand seed and the repetition of seed some of us know about our own family struggles that we deal with that have been generations above us family struggles that have taken out family members family struggles that have taken out individuals in our in our homes our uncles our aunts our grandparents and and we understand that seed can work for the bad and see can work for the good you want to bear good fruit because here's the thing it's not if you're not bearing good fruit then you're bearing nothing at all it is that if you're not bearing good fruit then there's another seed trying to take root and the other seed that's trying to take root is a
