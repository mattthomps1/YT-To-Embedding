[Music] Hey sir how are you today I am doing good man how about yourself you feeling great I am I'm feeling well I'm feeling with my hands that's how I'm feeling all right all right all right jokes immediately well listen the reason and purpose for this is because we had uh some issues this past Sunday with our technology online and we have a amazing online family that uh streams then and we wanted to make sure that they were able to hear what it is uh God placed on your heart and so um you and I talked and we came up with something called the remix uh you know um the remix you know for those who are watching this that don't know uh the name of the church's mix the mixed church right and so remix yeah you get it you see where this is going right and so I don't say I like it but I do I see where it's going let's keep going Sunday um you did an amazing job I know those who were in person uh got reaped all the benefits so you know you know how we say is nothing like an in-person meeting at the mix so you know but for those who are online we want to make sure that you are uh you know you get the blessing that those who were in-house got and so with that I just wanted to um just talk with you PM about um you know just what you know how you came up with this series this relationship series how do I know let's just start there like what what was on your heart when uh what came to your heart and mind when it came to this particular series well uh February relationship series um is what we think about uh what helps to kick that off Valentine's Day so it's the month of love you know and um we we just we're always thinking about relationships um whether they are in a sense romantic um friendship um parental you know people around our lives um but what really seems to affect our lives is the person that's usually close to us and that is the person that we use the word that we say we're in love with um and there's something about this feeling of being in love and uh this idea of as we are married and we're in in joining in one with somebody I think we we we just automatically got to get into a a series to talk about uh what that looks like when you when you're married um how are you thriving in it um how are you getting over um the challenges when you're single what does that look like how are you living your best life in your single life um and then some you know when we're in the in between man you know when we talking but we're not talking talking you know what I mean you know and then sometimes when we talk and talk about we're not like talking talking so it depends on how many times you say it like everybody's always got some questions whether you're out of it you're you're in between it or whether you're deep in it there's just always like how do I know and what what's the answers and the truth of the matter is is everybody is always trying to find out how they know how to do it well um right I can give it from an advantage point um but I have a certain spouse I have a certain individual in my life and so um it looks unique and it is different but I think the advice is is that there's just some commonalities in um what every season of your life looks like so we we said well let's dive into the question questions uh let's dive into the thoughts of people that are around and try to hit that up as much as possible so yeah man that's how we got into it yeah yeah yeah and so I know this particular Sunday ended that that series um and I I you know I must say it has been a blessing uh to be a part you know just to be a partaker in the series to to be a listener um it has been impactful has been uh challenging it has been encouraging and one of the things I think uh one of the best uh ingredients if you would I think it's been humorous and and I I I always look at the humor that you add um or that even that's added when when somebody is sharing I always look at humor like um like the flavoring to like a penicillin or something like you know like it's something that's it's hard to take but they say you know what let's make it palatable and I think human makes it palatable and um I think you do an excellent job at that um so much so um I know this particular Sunday um you were talking about um you started off this is before it got glitchy on us right okay you started off you started off uh talking about the woman who lost a coin in the house yeah um can you elaborate a little bit on on that moment um what made you share that you know from that you know that place and yeah and the title the specific title you went with yeah so what I was pulling was a principle of the idea when when this Parable comes specifically uh talking through the lens of lost souls so I don't want to get it mixed up that what she lost was a different context but what I really wanted to get is there is this principle that we we all know that we lose something and in this Parable uh what I liked about what Jesus was reflecting was even though there were uh other coins that she had it uh the scripture you know tells us uh that she had 10 silver coins and she lost one so there's these other coins she she loses one and even in losing it her pursuit of getting it back was just like crazy like she's like you know what I mean the Bible has her searching turning on all the lights she cans and that's like lighting candles we we think turning on lights that's kind of like throwing up the you know the curtains uh turning on candles lighting the lamp and she is seeking diligently and so what what the principle is the way in which we go after Things We Lost needs to be in the same um respect like when when in a relationship when in life um we feel like we're losing things sometimes I think the culture right now man is just like well if it ain't working then quit uh if it ain't if it ain't working right then you know I mean just go ahead and let it go um if there's a problem in it then just ignore it it's nothing to you got other things that are going well so I think this idea of the way in which she was seeking the Bible says diligently after what she lost I thought about this thing of hey a lot of times in a relationship we can lose ourselves um we can lose the impact of the relationship and what it really means and what it what we need to do to work on it um and then even in it where there's a family um we can lose our focus on our children so that was kind of the three layers it was like work on us work on me work on us work on them and um I thought about when I lose myself when I lose my confidence um when I lose my perspective man sometimes I'm crazy I just lose my mind um I'm thinking about the best way for it to be beneficial to my wife um to our family is for me to work on me and so sometimes we get into relationships we get into uh marriages and we lose ourselves but we're trying to make sure that marriage is stable make sure the children aren't stable and you can't even do that if you aren't where you need to be so just like we can lose ourselves we can lose our confidence we can lose our peace I think just like the woman we need to live literally sometimes put some other things that are are doing well that we know where are there and view at and go and find ourselves go and find our our our our our place of uh peace our place of Joy where we live out of anxiety when we live out of depression where we live out of responsibility I think it was just like one of the big things like man do not lose yourself and did not lose your relationship and don't lose your family so wherever you feel that there is this sense of loss go find it light a lamp you know what I mean sweep the house seek diligently for it and when we work in these areas we will find out that the way in which we um seek after to bring back those lost things whether it's me whether it's uh my relationship whether it's my family um when I do that man I just kind of find myself in a place where I'm back at where I need to be yeah so instead of quitting instead of walking away so that's kind of what I feel man sometimes it just we got to remember it takes work at relationships and we can't forget that so yeah that's kind of the heart behind the way I kind of went after this principle of really going after lost things sometimes the most lost thing if I can be honest as a pastor man sometimes the most lost thing is the things closest to me it's like I can I can teach people and preach to people about their homes and their marriages and their lives and their children but I was just thinking to myself one of the times when I've just kind of lost me or I've lost um putting into the relationship with my wife like I should because I got busy at church and I got busy at work or I've just neglected time with my family with our children with my grandson just because it was so important um for me to do the other things you know I mean like relationship is doing good I'm spending time with my wife I'm healthy but the problem is is is I'm just actually neglected our family and so I think when those moments happen you have to really go back at finding how do you get those things back you know yeah so that's kind of where I landed man yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um it's funny when you say that it reminds me um was that you know those indoor water parks we were at one called Great Wolf Lodge with my uh yeah we were there not too long ago with my kids and um and I was watching the guards and the lifeguards they do this thing where they're just walking back and forth and back and forth and so just the type of person I am I'm inquisitive and so I said hey man you know why are you guys walking back and forth and just looking right you know like and looking at the edge but you'll keep walking back and forth when you do that for your whole shift and he's like because the thing people drown right under our noses it's not like in the middle of the pool he said yeah drown right here right and so and and so what you saying that um you know sometimes is the thing that's lost is the thing that's closest I think significant the significance about that even Parable is that it was lost in the house right and you know what I'm saying like you feel what I'm saying and so yeah we're like you know I remember and you know just just rocking out sometimes just doing concerts and stuff like that and we're preparing for me and the band are preparing for you know to do this ministry and I remember the Holy Spirit stopping me in my tracks and he's like you so focused on the crowd and it's these dudes right here that are just lost and so you really just need to to to to to pull in and y'all need to just to you know to to talk and be vulnerable and and so you know again to your point some sometimes the the closest things to you are are are lost right and I think that's yeah so I I'm I'm certain as to why you said let's work at this let's don't that's not just throwing a towel let's work it oh yeah is that why you came up with that that title there yeah let's work at it you know we forget things things require work and work is not a negative word um right work is work is it doesn't have a negative connotation to it's just yeah that in order to keep something up you have to work at it if you own a home um you know it you you got to work at it like it's something's going up a water heater is going up something man is going go crazy and yeah we just bought a house not too long ago but we've replaced things and had to buy new areas we had to get things repaired why because everything even that has value needs repair it needs working at and um oftentimes we hope like love will solve everything and it it just does it like okay right man we gotta sit we gotta talk we gotta get to know each other again we've gotta spend time um it's different you know our kids from where they were to where they are now this in between phase um there's a lot of conversations there's a lot of moments of talking man man we're always trying to figure out like how do we make sure that we're staying on top of what's important even if we're in a season where we're not agreeing even if we're in a season where all our kids are not in church how do I make sure we don't lose them though like because the idea is that it's always going to work out perfectly this love is always going to you know just conquer all and love conquers all but relationships take work and it's just like man I gotta do something I gotta I gotta consider something I gotta remember five years and five months and if you're dating two years out 14 years later it's still going to take work and you're hearing stories so crazy man about people who've been married for 20 and 30 years Calling it Quits because yeah you stopped working and uh oh my man listen if if you're gonna if you know because you got we got the single world that's like I want somebody and I want somebody in my life and it's like man it is going to be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding things but just to let you know just to remind somebody in our church right it's like dude it takes work stop making this you know statement of we fell out of love no you just stop working at it you stop taking the time to remember what my love language is or how to fill my tank or how to really you know love me in this new season of where I am and so man I was just like man we gotta work at this thing y'all let's stop quitting everything let's stop uh putting the blame on each other let's go back and work at it and figure out how we get uh the best Families how do we have the the best marriages and how do we take care of ourselves um in the process without losing um these matters in these points as we go along in life that's kind of nice yeah yeah it's it I love that um and as you speak it reminded me of when my wife and I were moving to we kind of were looking for space in Virginia um when we drive from Jersey to Virginia hit it look for stuff drive back to Jersey and yeah um you know and so um one of the trips I had just asked the Lord I said you know what just give me a dope conversational starter for the ride up so that way it would just be we won't you know we will be working on our relationship we just won't be in the car listening to music not that there's anything wrong with any of those things but you got something in the Lord yeah but the lord gave me this one question man and it just kind of revolutionized a lot of things for me he told me to ask my wife who are you now right because you know I know who I married yeah but that's not who you are right now you know what I'm saying yeah because you're you're evolving you're you know my wife is a boss my wife is the owner of a restaurant like so I can't handle her even her schedule is not what it used to be when we first you're saying so and so I think I think what you're saying um is a lot of times we're we're still in relationship with the person we started out with like and so now absolutely I already figured you out so and I know and it's like I'm My love language has even changed like that's I've changed that that you know losing a parent it changed me and it does you know what I mean p.m and so I think uh this is the series this Series has really been a blessing I wish I mean if we could interject different people in my spot and just talk with you I'm pretty sure you would hear so many more testimonies of how it has impacted um yeah so um so yeah I mean I know you said um let's work at this and I know this has a myriad of different things it could be absolutely this is like uh you know what I'm saying like so yeah like talk about this I guess the the what that this could be for so many people that they can keep working at you know I was talking to somebody and the fifth is what we are now who we are individually who we are together who we are as a family that's what this is where we are what's happened uh we're we're in this space of uh what we are naming a post-pandemic um and I was thinking about you know some of us have gotten really used to uh our spouse the person we've been in a relationship being near us so close to us you know and um and now things are going back and they're changing they're not going back to normal but they're changing and so what I used to have very close to me uh you know it feels like things are taking it away again and you kind of get into this little space you know where it's like well you used to be here you used to be home in uh well now it seems like you know this is what is most important to you and I think oftentimes we don't have enough conversations in the changing of Seasons I'm one of those people you know like I don't feel like putting my clothes in a box when the season changed we were just talking to somebody about that like you know when it comes to here in Baltimore we're we're changing seasons and so we're we're trying to enter into a spring season which means you put away all your hoodies and you put away all your you know your sweatshirts and your boots and and you bring out your spring stuff and then maybe a long mostly sure but it's not as heavy a light jacket you know like we're going to get into that I think we change season so often man and we are still operating with the same like we got a hoodie on you know and it's like ah it's like 75 outside I don't know I'm sure that's you know what you need or we're going outside with that North Face on you know that big one joint I got fur on it you know we coming outside and it's like I I think you're perceiving this in the wrong season I think I think you're looking at this the wrong way um and I just think a lot has changed post pandemic uh your children have grown up they have different perspectives uh we oftentimes love comparing stuff to what it used to be and that's not what it is anymore and so there's just this constant growth like I gave this story at the top of the sermon about when I was dating my wife and um and she had three girls and some I needed to get to know them our oldest was in school but our youngest two I never forget she asked me to watch him and so I took him to the mall and and getting to know them you know one of the things you you try to do is you you try to buy love I'm gonna be honest with you straight out the gate you're trying to buy the kids love it and so I took him to the store called Justice and I was like pick out two things that you like I had no clue that they were 52 Dollar Jeans and jewelry that was 25 and 40 dollars and so when they went in there they went and they both picked out these pairs of jeans they were 52 each and these raspberry necklaces and they were 25 each and dude when I got to that cash register and paid over 160 dollars when I thought I was coming out of there and complaining like 50. it totally rocked my world I was like man I'm trying to get to know these kids and they are breaking me in my pockets well that's a difference now like now that's it's not the same thing thing it's not the same perspective me getting to know them now takes a lot more work and um it requires me to kind of delve into their world and I'm more of a coach in their life right now than I am this just authority of this is what you can do this is what you can't do you know we're talking differently but oftentimes you'll have somebody that's talking to their 20 year old like they're still five years old right and they're still relating in a way that it's expired if I can honestly say it to you if we've expired with that that's not the way it is anymore so um I I'm just really taking this idea of work at this and this is whatever it is that's in front of you that you don't really like where it's at you have to take the approach that I that means I need to work on this um if it is getting a book if it is sitting down in conversation if it is talking to a third party to get clarity and just ideas on how we make the this better I think we freeze ourselves in saying whatever perspective I have right now this is this perspective that we're going to live out of and I'm not going to change it I'm not going to alter it I'm not going to think differently about it and this is where I'm going to work out of and the idea is that sometimes when we're working or we're looking at relationships we have expired mentalities we have just things that do not work anymore we have things that have changed so I I really feel like this is whatever is in your life that you actually haven't given attention to that needs attention that needs a conversation that needs uh an opportunity to refocus um on new goals or just new things you guys have discovered and and kind of redefining this is what we're after now this is what we hold as our our standard this is what we say is our Focus today it may have been a house and it may have been a car but you guys have achieved that so we're no longer just kind of working that out getting out of the hole you know what I mean just struggling just making it that's not where you are anymore so now our goal can't be just about every day working to get out of this this thing now what are we talking about what does this look like so I kind of think this man is like where are you now and so many people have not talked that first to themselves like you've changed where are you now um then looking in the relationship and asking their spouse just the question you ask like where where in the world is this is are we what do you feel what happens somebody somebody's parents passed somebody's brother or sister passed here's the thing someone has had a medical problem that's changed the total Dynamic of their relationship absolutely absolutely what are we going to do about this um how are we going to walk this through some of us have lost the child some of us have lost um some things in our lives that honestly we can't just get back so in losing pieces of us when we lose others and and and feeling like their things are not the same um and I can't just go back to what I did on day one you know what I mean like that place that we went to y'all I'm gonna tell you the first place my wife and I went to it was highly expensive it's probably like like like like four dollar signs on the menu like it's this is super expensive it was Panera you know what I mean and so right that's where our first date was it was Panera so expensive I'm trying to tell you that that uh broccoli and cheddar Bowl blew my budget but right the true for the matter is is we drove past where that Panera's was it's not there anymore you know what I mean and so that's you know what I mean like some of those memories are some of those things that kept us together before or kept us up before aren't the same things that hold it together like it used to right and so um I just think like hey man how do we how do we really walk down that road and one of the things that I think um that sits top on Melissa is how are you where are you yeah how are you feeling about where you are men how are you feeling about the response ability that is in your corner how do you feel about the things that have changed since you were um just making it to the place where now you're trying to keep an upkeep on your your your career and this house that is you know bigger and much more responsibility and the amount of cars that you have like all these things that have come as a result of time now you got to figure out well who are you now that you come into this place what does that look like ladies you know what are you as either a new mom or um you know a mom whose children are they're out of the house so that that sense of being a mom and having kids there every day you know you may feel you're a little bit lost with purpose there or yeah for the person that actually is in divorce and they don't have that spouse there anymore but uh they may be at a place where um the individual has you know what I mean they're they're looking to uh be in a relationship again what in the world like right that's a great question what in the world and who am I in this season it's changed and so that's going to play a Major Impact so it's kind of walking through that cycling through making sure you're healed um of some things that have happened making sure that this relationship um these are Love Languages you know what I mean do you still need words of affirmation is it still gifts for you is it still that physical touch like are these things still the same or are they involved and if they had then I've got to learn a new way to approach where we are and what we do and then I think really coming to that understanding that man that um with time things change so it's gonna take some work um It's Gonna Take just just being open to what does your family look like now what is this relationship look like now what is this what does this new space look like you know I mean Peter yeah yeah absolutely I get it and I and I love that so yeah um it's the work it's work you know you know if if you don't want to do it this is relationship is not for you and the reality is relationship is in every area of life whether you've got co-workers or culture neighbors his relationship is you know is is it's inevitable you can't get away from it it's always there and so um yeah and you know relationships do expose you know at times and so which is you know one of the things that I was funny because I was reading today and um and I was just thinking about you know where you know scripture just where just is like you know what Jesus is doing these miraculous things with his with his with his new group because the guys and he's like and he does this thing where he brings all these fish in and they're like you know depart from me for I am a sinful man it's like this relationship that even with God you know it makes sense to me why people don't like why you should you can see packed churches on Sundays and then like Bible study is like it's like it's 20 people here we've got a thousand plus people and I said why is nobody here on Wednesday midweek and you could see that there's a pers there's a lack of a Pursuit because people have figured it out the closer I get to him the more I see who I really am yeah right you know what I'm saying like and so it's like you know like it's like oh I'm really ugly because he's really attractive like he's yeah so he's so precious he's you know I mean and so relationships they expose you know marriage it expose how selfish you know one can be I'm saying like yeah and so yeah so that's why people are like you know what I'm seeing me too much let me get out of this let me I mean how can I back out of this this is too much I'm I'm done with this relationship thing right yeah yeah you know and so I know you met with the singles and I know you met with the married uh yeah uh those things are crazy this week some things crazy oh my gosh yeah they're hilarious yeah yeah yeah and I you know and you know one one of the things I learned even in uh even in just you know as as we Pastor people you know especially with singles just like you you're trying it's when it comes to that relationship context it's like you're trying you've you've always you're always trying to get married people in the bed and single people out of it it's like you know what I'm saying like yeah you know what I mean it's like there's there's so many things that um you know the expectations have changed again if you've never changed your expectations if you never adjusted them and you still had the same ones from when yeah they were 18. and you're like yeah like you know what I'm saying like absolutely things that have happened to the body from childbirth there are things that have happened through age you know like this time I'm just brushing my teeth and my hip pop out and I'm like I just that my teeth don't have nothing to do with my hips listen listen and it's just age it's just it's age it's time it is right the circumstances of where we are you know um I really think about it's like well how do I work on me you know one of the that's why I said at the number one for me is working on me has so much to do with what I can give in the relationship and then what I can give to my children like it it speaks volumes to the amount of um I want to say grace and truth you know that we have to apply when we're working in those sense of circumstances and so some of us are already you know I'll talk to some single people and they're just like how do I know I'm Marrying the right person are they self-evaluating are they are they assessing themselves like are you are you hearing them saying conversations about hey not this just about this self-dumping of like I don't like this about me I don't but are they saying hey this is this is something I could get better and think about differently are they coming back with conversations that um are apologetic because they evaluated the conversation that they had you know what I mean they they thought about the argument that you guys went through in and when they got back to it the their perspective wasn't about I I talked about this uh this idea of keeping score you know what I mean if I won the argument if I didn't win the argument no you're trying to figure out do I have the person that comes back and says hey I I didn't see that the right way hey I I didn't I'm off like I've had a bad my my supervisor has been wearing me out and I see it's affecting the way I communicate or it's affecting the way that I see things it's affecting the way I I you know I'm just coming home with it and so hey I'm I'm telling you there's some things that I've got to work on that's important my wife and I had a great discussion the other night and we're I was just telling her some honest places of hey this is just what I feel and she was like hey I think this is the result of where you are and I said I wanted to share it with you so that you don't think that maybe where my head is has so much to deal with or to think about it's your fault because sometimes we're in spaces and our spouse or the person we're dating doesn't know what to do with it just because we don't even know where we are we can't share we can't articulate it yeah we can articulate and so there's this idea at times that we should just be able to guess figure it out and I talked about this like in the first message which was there's this stay season and there's this season where you just gotta get to know you know when you're off knowing you you're at a point where you need to reevaluate or reassess or even just refresh where you are um maybe you need to take a weekend and go to a hotel and just like pour out or you know just maybe there's a crying you're just something you can't get in the moment moments of where you are because you have been done the work on you and so maybe you've got to pull back for a second and say hey this is what I got to do this is where I gotta go um do you mind and this is not about what I feel about you this is about some things I'm dealing with Within Myself and I know that there are some pieces that I can do that can help bring some correction to where I am and so that's the idea that I'm thinking through which is hey if I am applying this or my spouse has the Liberty to say something's changed what's going on um I think when you're looking at that in a relationship talking about single people when you're looking at that and who you're choosing that should be a part of the if they're perfect all the time ah some questions going on yeah because all of us aren't good all the time right that's what I told the the people who were looking at our uh reviews at the restaurant I said if you see all good ones it's the bad ones that actually validate the good ones right you know what I'm saying like it's it's it's if you if you all only see good Something Fishy is going on somebody had somebody didn't like something right yeah somebody somebody's just going to like yeah my my Cheesesteak wasn't um but I think to your point p.m I think to be I'm a packages as a club could it be because culturally we've learned to fight figure out who we are via dating a bunch of people let me just like I break up with her break up him let me go to like you just keep dating you like you figure out like you know what I do like I you know I like people that are more quiet I like people that do this I like people you know I mean like and we culturally we find out who we are and never take the time in that stay season because we probably didn't even know that state season was a thing until you preached it like three weeks ago right like yeah there's this there's a season where we just need to be in part and say who am I right would you say that that's yeah I think it's the it's the most important because it guides it guides who we are as as a couple and as a family like it exposes so much so you're coming from so many so many lanes man where I think you know you've got someone who's coming out of a home there's a single mom you've got someone who's coming out of a home there's a single dad you got somebody coming out of a home man I'm gonna tell you truthfully they're they're in they're from foster care they're from some there's from situations um adoption there's all kinds of lanes that we're coming from that play such a big role in my way of thinking in my way of understanding and so a lot of times when I'm not in the season of getting to learn who I am getting to know see um allowing God's holy spirit and presence to speak to the things you know like some of us are irate and driving you know I've had those moments where I've just been like what is wrong with you you know like why why can't you handle um moments that happen and why you're not good with change um right it teaches you that yeah like you're not good with change you're not good with conflict um if you look at your life you're not really good with being proactive you're mainly reactive and so all of those play a context to the kind of um mate you're going to be in a situation and what kind of parent you're going to be in a situation and so I really kind of think it it just speaks to the level of in the state season it's the season where I know financially how I am I know if I if I really am the good person when it comes to budgets and and keeping things and you know like you you just who in the world are you if we have two people that were working on them in a relationship to come back to it to work on them as a unit man there will be so many more areas that we would be so much more gracious in because we would see where we are not as perfect as we think we are absolutely absolutely and so because I know I I mess up because I know that I don't see all the way like I should see the Bible says they have eyes but they can't see it they have ears but they they don't they don't hear like that happens to me and so if I'm not assessing that man I get in some crazy moments and everything is real like if you'll be you know real crazy like he's so tense you so you you know you're in a moment where everything is so serious and you you're not even fun y'all used to be fun but now it's not fun everything is responsibility everything is what's next everything is mortgage bills and that's realistic places but then you got to figure out well if we if if we've lost the humor The Joy the fun in the relationship the things that we did together that really was able to make us feel free in the spaces we're in and we're like no that's not happening right now then what are you expecting to happen you know what I mean like what are you expecting the relationship to turn out to be this is the most serious you're the most you know disgruntlet mental person ever like we need to figure out if um you know a white picket fence um and um you know a car and all of that is what we really need in the relationship or is it just a healthier balance in where we are because everything we're going after we say this I'm well I'm trying to do this for us but the problem is is there is no us to do it for because that is oftentimes just fleeting and fading away man just because of where we are in our lives so that's been the series that's been the idea of constantly in a conversation a relationship how do we work it out I think that's just where we kind of are like I've got to figure this out with work not with just setting things in place and saying if we do it this way it's gonna always just work out this way it's not and so the more that I put time and that's really what it is the work is tying into me time into US time into our family to assess it um then I think we've got a better chance at seeing greater results from um living a bountiful life that God has for us to live and and everybody's single won't see themselves as the worst of the worse or the abandoned right and everybody who's married won't see themselves trapped right absolutely absolutely oh man this has been great um I'm glad I thought of it anyway um wow wow right wow just keep working on you just keep working on you just keep working on you right and so yeah and I pray for your family and and your wife as well in these moments thank you please please do um what would you what would you conclude with what would you what's the what's a I mean there's so many ways to go with this I mean we can almost do this uh you know regularly right because there's so many places to go with just talking about relationships and especially for believers but what um what would you what would you conclude with um what will be some final words or that you would just say to people in any relationship yeah I think understanding especially in this culture right now the importance of relationships um the Bible lets us know in Genesis that God said it's not good that man be alone man did not know it that it wasn't good God told him being alone is not what we aspire to um in a a culture that is very much on um we love categories so putting people in the introvert or extrovert category um and giving them permission to stay away from people and not do life and not have obstacles and and not come into moments of such gratitude and being in community and also coming to moments that are complicated in being in community with people I think wherever you are whether you're single and you're in your stay season whether you're dating you're in your Pursuit season um whether you're in your change season that's the season where you're you're in a relationship and you're trying to figure out what is it really going to take in order for this to start its process of becoming one um and that's that season of change some challenges that exist between where you are where you are getting into the place of uh making someone um your fiance or moving into that next Lane of getting married what does that look like you know for you and then also those that are honest actually married right now and trying to really ask God for a better marriage and better not by somebody else coming into it or leaving it better by it it being defined as something you you have to know that every relationship in your life you're going to have to work on and you need relationships to truly produce out of you what God has inside of you yeah hike if if if if if I could say that like you're going to be working at some kind of relationship always right you're going to be working at it whether it's a friendships around you um whether it is again a dating scene whether it is the relationship of marriage um you're always going to be working at it so the first place to start with you is the first place um that you have to go and looking at your relationships in your life and then you start going further out the closest is again if you're if you're married it's your spouse if the person that's your Beyonce that you're dating and then move on from there if you have children and parents whatever you do when you're trying to figure out how do you know if a person is the person if they're the one that you should be with I think it is assessing who you are where you are what are the standards that God has placed in your life you need standards for every relationship you're in you need standards for everything that you're a part of and and I think those standards say this is how I conduct myself in this relationship this is what it looks like and I think with those standards and and it's just operating out in life you figure out this is who in this season God's called me to be with this is who I'm supposed to be connected with you and I have been connected for years and we've had so many different seasons seasons of um where we met each other and we were new friends seasons of um me playing for you you being an artist and us having that that relationship there in this season of uh where you've been a part of the church and you've helped the pastor and and Lead so many people um in this direction of walking Jesus and having a relationship with him I think we have had to just in our own lives recognize like is this a healthy relationship you know what I mean yeah the the friend to the to the working together to the working back again together like what's the healthiness of this relationship you and I have had a lot of very straightforward talks and so it's me we've been able to make the decision that having one another in each life in each of Our Lives is a good decision based off of the work that we've done in each one to make sure that um we're getting the best the quality the the best that we can from it I think that's in any relationship whether you're single with friends whether you're talking to somebody I'd say talking talking or man you're in right now in marriage um you're you're gonna have to work at this and you can't you can't work at a relationship by quitting it you gotta go you got to go find what's been lost and if that's where you're supposed to be if that's what God's called for you to do if you're in a marriage you can't just walk away because you don't feel it anymore um you've got to go back and search for light a lamp Bible says um clean up make sure that you don't have a lot of things interfering in your relationships that's keeping it from coming to where it needs to be and the last part it says seek diligently and then when you find it when you when you get it to a place of healthiness the Bible says that she Rejoice she told people about it tell people about the testimony of what just God's done in your life through your relationships through the people that are connected that helps other people know what they should be looking for when they come into a relationship absolutely again whether it's friendship whether it's dating or whether it's a marriage um it's just as a testimony to how to see things go in a better way be more impactful than ever before man that was great well man it's been a pleasure and I I pray that always those who are watching this are super encouraged and pray that they were uh just impacted laughed you know learned and um and they and that they stick and stay and and they can stay and work at it and I mean work at this whatever that this is like you said on Sunday whatever your this is work at this and I'm guarantee you and I see this in my closing that every Hustler I know every dude that used to hustle on the corner um they used to get money you know I mean get it fast and but those same guys when uh I would tell them my job or something was hiring hey man you come down they would get the job now they weren't making as much money as they were on the streets but one of the things that they felt was so much better when they got a pair of shoes and got an outfit or was able to buy a car or something felt better about and the only thing that happened was they started working for the Thing versus just getting Easy Money quick money right and so there is something so significant about when you put the work in absolutely see the results of it I mean it's why LeBron has tears in his eyes on the court because he put up all these these he passed surpassed the the record that nobody ever thought would be broken he put the work in it wasn't it wasn't just shooting jump shots it was the the leg days the arm days the change in my diet so that I could have a longer career and so I appreciate you PM I appreciate everything you bring to my life and my family's life into the world I can't I can't wait till we do this again yeah absolutely we're gonna you know what I was thinking we're just gonna throw this up on YouTube and uh people can click right in and be able to um just experience the conversation we love you guys and we're so grateful uh we want to pray over you um and just ask God's uh hand in favor and blessings over your lives as you just kind of walk through these Seasons working at the things that
