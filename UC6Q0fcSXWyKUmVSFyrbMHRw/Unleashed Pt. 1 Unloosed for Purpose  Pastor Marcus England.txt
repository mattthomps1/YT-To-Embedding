[Music] thank you and whatever it is that you're going through in life today it is not on to death so get a hold of yourself tell your neighbor real quick get a hold of yourself you got to get a whole lot because here's what I want to tell you is that what God is doing is not about what you want him to do but it is all about what he is doing in your life for the purpose of his glory when Jesus talks to the disciples he comes back and says we're on our way back to Bethany and they say to him Jesus they tried to kill you there they they tried to uh Stone you in that region and Jesus says listen when I have something that I already have purpose to do I've got to be on my way to do the father's work here's what I want to let you know is that there is nothing hindering God from coming to your situation he is on his way and there is nothing that the enemy there is nothing that your haters there is nothing that your boss there is nothing that the people around you can do God is on his way and when he gets there he has a mission of what he will do and shall do in the place now as we jump into scripture it says in verse 38 then Jesus after speaking to Mary and Martha who were disappointed that Jesus had not come I don't know if I can tell you this but there have been moments where I've been disappointed because things didn't turn out the way I thought they should and I looked at Jesus to say had you come in time I wouldn't be where I am I wouldn't be in the financial State I am I wouldn't be in a relationship that I am in I wouldn't be where I am today if you had come when I called you but today Jesus is saying I want to let you know I may not come when you want but I promise you I am right on time all right and it says take me to where Lazarus is verse 38 says then Jesus groaning in himself came to the tune it was a cave and and the stone lay against it and Jesus said take away the stone I'm going to tell you as simple as this there are some things in your life that God wants to take away and you're like whoa whoa oh god I've been I've been caught up in that for too long that's been a part of my life for so long I've been dealing with that sickness that disease I've been dealing with this broken mindset for so long but Jesus said when I come into the situation I want you to remove any barrier that gets me to what I need to get to why because I am the Lord of hosts I am the god of Jacob I Am The Refuge that you sit in and wait on I am everything you need so when I say take away the soul don't you be scared to walk in the old places she used to walk because God is doing somebody say a new thing it says that's the song was laid against it Jesus said take the stone away do you ever know somebody [Music] who's always got something to say they always in the middle when something great is about to happen they can't help but lean to the place of negativity anybody you know anybody hey you know we God's gonna do it this year well well you know you've said that last year [Music] you think it's time you give it up he is he spent a long time since you've been out there doing that it's been a long time since you were dreaming that dream it's been a long time since you've been in this situation you think you might should let it go [Music] assist of said to him Lord by by this time there's there's a stench it stinks for he's been dead four days maybe you could erase them at one maybe you could erase them in year two maybe you could erase them in here you're three maybe you could have raised me in year four but they're saying there's a smell everybody knows you failed everybody knows that the business went under everybody knows that the marriage didn't work you can still restore it says it smells it it lurks it means that it got out to other people what you thought was a failure got out to other people what what you thought you were hiding in the background everybody already knew and so you said instead of being embarrassed even more I'll just stay where I am just let it stay where it is and Jesus said I wanna I wanna speak to a debt situation [Music] he said did I not say to you that if you believe you would see the glory of God it says then they took the stone from the place where the dead man was lying and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank you that you've hurt me and I know that you always hear me but because of the people who are standing by I said this that they may believe that you sent me I want to tell somebody today that there is something that God wants to do in your life that has nothing to do with you it has nothing to do with how well you've been doing it it has nothing to do with how faithful you are it has nothing to do with how holy you are God is saying I just want to use you so that I can get the glory so that everybody around you can see that I'm still a miracle working God now if you would understand this that you would get and get excited because you would understand on a normal day you don't meet the qualifications but today there's a possibility that God is moving on your behalf in spite of what you have done to mess it up now I want to say this to somebody you need to get on the other side of 23 and be able to say God if that's me and I still got another opportunity I'll take it right now and if you want to bless me so that I can be a blessing well then you go ahead and bless me bless me indeed and enlarge a large mind story [Applause] [Music] verse 33. he says now when you said these things he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and the Bible says in he who done came out bound [Music] and foot with grave clothes why is that important because some of you God has released but you're still bound you're bound by your past you're bound by your mistakes you're bound by your insecurities you're bound by even moments of Disobedience that have brought a struggle in your life and you're trying to overcome it by yourself even though he who the son sets free is truly free indeed but I need you to understand today that your freedom is not just in your salvation your freedom is through the power and the presence of the Holy Spirit which activates inside of you the ability to walk out the new you that God has called for you to be now if you want to stay where you are in your salvation that all you want to do is be a good person and do good things and seen as a good individual you can say there but I'm interested in some people who want to maximize everything that God has placed inside of them and they see themselves as not just getting fire but being an overcomer and being a conqueror and being a Victor I'm crazy enough to believe that it is is willing to bless me for the sake that others can believe then I'm crazy enough to see that he's willing to lose the chains that have me bound what he's saying is I see that he's brought salvation to your life but I still see the generational hold and the Brokenness over your life [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I've given you eternal life but you have a life now that you're not thriving in and John 10 and 10 says that Jesus said I come that you might have life and have life more abundantly maximize to the top and greatest potential that you have I'm not interested in you being mediocre I'm not interested in you staying where you are I'm not interested in you just being saved I'm not interested in your position or your title I'm interested in taking your life and flipping it upside down and using you to break strongholds and using you to change cities and using you to break generational curses and using you to restore your community and using you to break addiction all around I'm interested in using you but you have to be free just because we are raised to life in Christ does not mean we're operating at the full potential that God has called for us to do so I am here to tell you today to optimize everything that God has put inside of you so that you can see the maximum potential of God using you he's the kind of God that will use you to open a red sea he's the kind of God that'll use you to speak a word and a demon will move and flee he's the kind of God that will help you speak into the life of people and the chains will fall he wants to use you for more than where you are [Music] but he said Jesus said this took me a while to get here but this was an important part it says Jesus said to them lose him [Music] lose some [Music] yeah you let me say something real quick to the ultra spiritual person inside of me not you just me because the idea that I have is that what God wants to do in me is for me and it's going to be done by me the problem that I don't understand is that he's called me to do life with other people and those other people are a part of me seeing the chains broken generationally in a community and everything around me but here's what I like to do this is our society that I tell you we struggle with we struggle with doing it by ourselves and we've been called to do it somebody say together just want to let you know we're better together we're better when I link up with you and you link up with me we're better when I can see some of your holes and you can see some of mine we're better when I've been through that struggle and I can help you and the struggle I'm going through you've been through and you can speak to me I want to tell you we're better together I want to tell you you're better together because there's a gift that you have over your life that I don't have over my life there is something that is inside of you that isn't inside of me and I need you in order to truly see the freedom that God has over my listen I want to tell you something if the church got together there would be an explosion in your city in your community in your county in your family because there's something about the Bible says when two or three are gathered together touching and agreeing that's he'll be in the midst and I'm just crazy enough to believe that if you get connected with me and I get connected with you that's an explosion that God wants to do to break change to bring healing to Safe detective free in the name of Jesus Christ he said loose him and guess what like him go I want to tell you today somebody in this place is the reason why you're still struggling Where You Are it's because you've been trying to get Freedom by yourself you've been trying to get Freedom today by yourself and in the name of Jesus I declare that you will stay where you are until you connect with who God has called for you to connect with there is freedom that God has in community there is freedom that God has with others around you there is freedom that God has for people that have your best interests at heart so I advise you before you leave out of here you need to get somebody number and say I need to link up I need just two somebody say all three just look around you and find somebody and I am and say hey it might be you but my freedom is in your life my freedom and deliverance is in you 2023 ain't no resolution by myself go get it I need some people around me to surround me and say you're blessed in the city you're blessed in the field you're blessed when you come and when you go everywhere the soul of your foot shall tread there you shall have I need somebody to connect with me just look at your savior and say are you with me neighbor all right all right all right all right [Music] [Applause] he said lose something he said and let him go you need somebody to help loose you can I say this oftentimes I think too highly of myself and I walk in this idea that I've got it all together and that the way that I think in the way that I'm moving the way that I operate is the best way all together but when I get connected with some people who can say to me your way is good but there's a better way there's something else you need to know there's somebody else you need to get connected to there's something else you need to do I want to let you know today your freedom and your next season is locked in your community you need somebody else just say your name real quick I need you y'all sit down sit down sit sit down sit down you're gonna get people nervous I want to come from a a topic today you're like he's just getting to the topic this is scary [Music] I promise you we gonna kiss you out but I want to come real real briefly from this topic on loose on purpose unless on purpose can we pray father unleash us from anything that keeps us bound anything that holds us anything that limits us anything that's a barrier for us whether it's our way of thinking whether it's our traditions whether it's our culture whether it's our race whether it's our politics whatever it is loses on purpose in Jesus name say Amen thank you so much musicians don't go far we won't be long amen can you help me give a hand to our Dream Team y'all our volunteers here thank you so much when I thought about this series unleash I thought about the idea that there are some things inside of you and I that God has called to be maximized that God has called to burst forth in our lives that oftentimes stay where they are we have good intentions that we would love to have a New Year's resolution that through that New Year's resolution we would automatically spin on to become the person and the individual that God has called for us to be but the truth of the matter is is without there being thought and intentionality and a plan and a process we will all stay where we are we will learn to get comfortable in the spaces that we are we'll learn to be able to build a life around where we are we will learn to really find ourselves at a level where we've amused ourselves so much that we believe that where we are is the top of where we can go but I'm here today to give you an idea that there's a possibility that there is more inside of you than you even know I'm here today because I believe that God is doing something and he is Shifting in this atmosphere a idea that there is greater that is located it on the inside of me there is greater that goes beyond the potential of what I have to make there is greater that goes beyond the potential of what I have to uh receive in assets and what I can buy there is something on the inside of me there is a lane there is a level of confidence that walks in on the inside of me through the power of the holy spirit that I'm not walking daily in my struggle of figuring out how am I going to get out of this depression I'm literally amazed each and every day that I'm not walking in depression I really believe that there is something on the inside of us that is greater than we've ever experienced before something that unleashes the potential that's in me that everything that I think about actually comes into fruition because God is with me God is for me and God is in me and I think today that if we saw ourselves the way that God sees us we would recognize that there are some things in us that we have never seen before and here is the idea is that the enemy would have you believe because there is a pattern a Brokenness a pattern of failures in our life that we are subjected to that being the totality of our lives but I want to let you know today that there is something special about the great God that we serve for he is the god of the impossibility he is the god that sees us the way he already created us not sees us the way that we see ourselves and if you could understand today that there is such greatness inside of you you would not look at this year as another year but you would look at it as the year you would look at it as the moment and you will look at it as the opportunity for God to do something in your life like never before I would be itching to say that you are so excited to see what God is going to do that you are just waking up in expectation that God is going to do Supernatural things signs Miracles and wonders in your life I'm waking up today trying to figure out who am I I'm going to speak to that is going to break free from the area of their life that they've been suffering and I'm interested in how God's going to use me and my family to walk into the next place and to declare Freedom over the lives of another family I am wondering how God is going to use me and my wife to be able to speak life into a couple into a relationship into a marriage that seems like it's broken but God is going to restore it and bring it back together this year what we would do is wake up with a sense of expectation that there is more just somebody tell your neighbor real quick there is more I wonder if you really believe that there is more I wonder if you really believe that God has something greater for you than he had the year before here I like the idea that there was a Red Sea split I like the idea that there was a burning bush but I don't need that in 2023. I need God to break free and open some doors and to remove some chains and barriers that I have never seen him do before I need the crime to go down and young people to live again I need there to be a cancer recession happening where people are healed in the name of Jesus Christ I really believe that this is an opportunity in a season to see God move in ways we've never seen before the Bible says exceeding abundantly above more than we can ask or think I believe there is something to people coming together of all Races in all nations and all nationalities that they are in the same midst helping one another and moving forward the purposes that God has for our life I'm just crazy enough to believe that inside of me is the answer to the problems that are in this world God did not create me to work at nine to five to go back home and to live it again day after day without making an impact I don't know if this thing is on but I want to say today I believe there's a potential and something inside of you that should break free that should bring up change in this world you're not just a world changer by name you're a world change about what God has placed on the inside of you and I'm just a crazy thinker to think this is the year of what God wants to do the favor of the Lord is on my life just because he wants to use Mia to change to see the captive set free to Open the Eyes of the blind literally and figuratively I believe that God wants to use me to do something but I have to see it that there's more on the inside just tell your neighbor real quick there's more I believe the expectation is that God is doing something crazy and something great that no one has seen for the Bible says there is something that no eye has seen no ears heard and no mind has conceived the things that God has in store for those who love him I think like many of us we walk into the new year with the resolution but we're looking for the resolution to resolve quicker because we haven't really believed by faith that God can do this Supernatural and so we have an expectation some of you are in the gym just got your new gym membership you're excited about the gym membership you're getting in the way of the people who are already been in the gym the previous year you're taking up all the machines so they're just waiting for February to come two to three some of you four weeks but before it becomes vacant again [Music] and we begin to make excuses for why we don't take the next step I think it's important that you understand that God wants to do something but he wants to do it in his timing I think it's important to understand that there is your timing and there is God's timing and those timings do not usually align at the same moment why because your urgency oftentimes leaves you at a place of immaturity what you want urgently God cannot give you because you're not ready to receive what he has for you if he gave it to you at the inappropriate time then you would believe that you had something to do with it you will believe that it was the power of your prayer and you will believe it was the power of your doing you will believe it was your resume you will believe it is your active way in which you are in the stocks in the bonds you would tell people it's all about me if you understood the way my life is I can sit down and give you a blueprint but there are some people who may be like me who don't understand all of the nuances of how to be so uh economically Savvy and and how to be so good at it but there's something that you've learned to do you've learned to trust in the Lord the Bible says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not to thy own understanding but in all thy ways you are called to acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your path now if you understood that you would begin to say that I've got God and I need to grow I have God and I need to understand I've got God but I need to gain knowledge and so there are people like me who are still learning about the things that I need to do in order to create the life that God has called for me to create but here's what I understand is that God will do it when he's ready you need to write that down when God is ready you will see it if it's not seen it means it's not time stop getting frustrated because God is in a different time frame than you are stop getting mad because you feel God is off in Isle of alignment I want to let you know that anything that God is withholding is for the best and I'm telling you today if you get it at the wrong time you will waste it but get it at the right time in the right season on the right day when it matters and I'm telling you you will see doors open like never before don't you rush this thing too fast because if you rush it too fast you'll mess it up and lose the nuances of knowing if it had not been the Lord that was on my side I would not even have this thing right now so I recognize even when I started not believing he still said he is faithful now he said this to Mama Martha you got to understand that you've got to believe didn't you understand I said the way according to which you believe is the way it will happen I'm here today to let you know what you've got to do is amp up your faith in 2023 you've already tried to work hard but what you need to do is amp up the faith to believe that God can do what he said he will do do you really believe that God is a miracle working God and that he has the ability and the know-how to do what he already created to do the Bible says every day of my life is written in his book it is not a surprise that you messed up last year God had already planned for all your mess ups so guess what you're still on course and I'm telling you today it it's your bell you're better than me but all the Bible says you need to do is wait on the Lord and be a good parents and he show us strengthen your heart why because waiting takes patience thank you [Applause] some of you the devil has been whispering in your ear you should be further than where you are [Applause] over this by now you shouldn't be dealing with this and what he begins to do is give you a perspective that you have the ability to get to where God has called for you to be by yourself and so you lack faith and you lack trust because you think you're smart you're Savvy I can work the system I know how to do this thing y'all I'm good if you can sit down with me I can change your life in five seconds here's the problem I can't change my own life in five seconds I doubt you can do it [Applause] see what we've got to learn is that when God is being glorified it's not a quick fix he is doing something in his timing because there is a purpose beyond the idea of fixing the situation it is that the process of the situation is turning to fix you and to make who he's called you to be to come into fruition so what you must understand is that what God is doing is on purpose it is not because he forgot about you it is not because he's late on hearing your prayer I want you doing these 21 days to know that every time you pray she hears you and he is putting together the right timing to make sure that when he answers whether it either be a yes or a no I want you to understand whatever God's answer is is the right answer right if he says no go within and say I don't know what you kept me from but I thank you so the Bible says in all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus what concerning you now if I learn to give thanks and I learned to walk in and say God if you say yes I thank you and if you say no I might count a little bit but I've still got to thank you on the other side of it the Bible says as is Martha and Mary look at Jesus with a sense of uh you got here anybody ever been there before it got it got it got turned off the deal went sour you lost the money the grant didn't go through the the every if if you had been here if if you had been here this would not be the way that it is and what Jesus has to let you know is that whatever it is that you're going through is not unto death so get a hold of yourself can you can I say this in 2023 cry and then wipe your tears and get up I'm not going to tell you don't cry because that's just insensitive Through the Bible lets us know even Jesus weapon so the emotions that God has given you are not called to be stopped off they're called to be recognized but they're not just called to be reacted to I don't mind take a moment cry I lost it it's not where it was I thought it was going to be more I thought this was going to be greater but here's where you cannot stay and the disappointment that God doesn't know what he's doing I need you to gather yourself up and I need you to Curt up the loins of your mind and I need you to be able to understand he's doing something on the inside of me he's building me he's sustaining me I don't care how long you've been in this Christian wall you are not where you need to be God is always building and growing and developing and even with his disciples he said I'll let you know you'll understand this thing we're understanding you heard them say well understand it better buy and buy means Time and Time and Time will give you more clarity there's things that you did in your 20s that when you're at in your 30s just saying I don't know what in the world I was thinking if I could change that I would have never went down that road if I would have never met you I swear I would not be where I am I promise you I thought to myself in my 30s if I had not made that purchase I promise my credit would have been better I would not have to get that payday loan at 99 interest then I'm still paying off 600 for 17 years but the thing of it is is all of us have been there and we find ourselves at the place where we wish that there were some things we had made better decisions on in life but God says here's the thing I don't do what I'm doing in your life according to what you did in your past I am a God who is a redeemer I am a God who sees you and knows you and still understands with every mistake and every mess up point of your life I still have a purpose and a plan for your life [Music] oh my goodness and because I have a purpose and a plan I want to unleash you from the things that hold you down I think about leashes I I'm in a dog walking community and uh I see it I haven't had a dog for a while now I want to start off saying that I used to have a Chow Chow you know if you remember that's that's a dog that looks like a bear or a lion it's a little little small one but he's very aggressive very aggressive very very aggressive um and uh we we would call him his name was koi and I never forget my my dad brought him um he was truck driver and he brought him in in the dug he was just so adorable anybody know about adorable watch out for adorable things I'm that's not Bible but I'm just telling you watch out for adorable things they can be terrorizing grows up but this dog is highly aggressive highly strong and we have this wasn't out back in the day you just had a good grip leash you know the kind of that can wear your hand out is yeah and the leashes have gotten they've gotten real tricky now and then but this it was we had one of these one of the one of the hey hey hey hey all right all right and what we were trying to do is because we understood the aggressive nature of what was inside of him we had to keep him on the leash he could not be released in the dog park he's not a dog park kind of dog he had to be on the leash carrying him making sure because he was looking for something to get into and so the leash this kind of leash kept us pulling him but but but but there was these other leashes that that I I'm noticing now that there's this kind of leash where it gives you Doug a little lead way and I think some of us in our lives we God has given us this you you're successful you're killing it you got you got a little money and so he he's giving you a little little extra lint you know what I mean like he's not yanking you back he's he's giving you leeway but the problem is in all your ways you haven't acknowledged him and so you you know when they get to you anybody ever seen a dog on this but it don't look like the owner knows how to how to put a little lock on it anybody ever been there before and the dog start coming at you and you like I promise you I promise you I come out my door and that thing be like oh now all right now [Music] and some of us God has trusted you to be able to go far but some of us the enemy has been really good at making sure that you don't go too far and God is saying I actually don't want you on a leash I want you to have the fruit of the spirit joy peace kindness gentleness faithfulness self-control I want to be able to release you to what you're called to really be you were never called to be on a leash but the only reason that you find yourself on a leash is because there are things in you that you can't control and I believe today that God is saying is that I want to grow you in such a way that we don't no longer need a leash that I can release you into to the purpose and the destiny that I have set over your life that you will no longer stay where you are but that you will be leashed to do things that seem exceedingly impossible and I just believe today that you are sitting in position and in seat for God to use you to do something more than you have ever imagined him doing I'm today to let you know you have been on loose for purpose that's where we're going in this series you've been on loose for purpose why are you here why is God releasing a new area of your life not to make you scared why do you feel like you have more weight on you than you can handle not for you to buckle is for you to trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding here's what I think I think the pressure on your life right now has something to do with God wanting to see more from you than you retreating from and quitting what God has in store for you I just happen to think you've got more in you and I believe that God wants to do something with more and he wants to transform your life now here's the thing is that oftentimes we find ourselves in the place where we bound but we're free you're bounding your mind but you're free and what you can do and here's the thing about a person that's Bound in the mind to freeing the actions is they tend to follow their feelings and not the spirit and presence of God and here's what I want you to get and understanding is is as God is unleashing you to Greatness he is believing that as he is building you you are growing to a place that he can see what is to take placing you to be complete here's what Philippians 1 and 6 says he says I am sure of this that he who started a good work in you we'll carry it out until completion on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ there's a good work in you that you're called to do in 2023 the question today is as we go home is what's the good work that God's called you to in 21 days of prayer I need you to seek the Lord and say God what is what is what is the good work you've called me to what's the thing that you're raising up inside of me no no it's not just the thing you did last year God's saying I'm trying to do somebody say a new thing I believe behold there is a new thing don't you perceive it don't you see it don't listen tell tell your neighbor real quick I see it see it sometimes chew why because oftentimes though you have been raised to life you're still blind and can't hear and I'm today believing that somebody's coming into your life that's going to help unwrap the grave close is not where you're supposed to be I need you to get up today I'm sick of this with you every time we come into the new year you write this list all down to tell me what you gonna do and where you gonna be here's the thing we gonna do it this year or stop calling me cause I'm sick of it because I believe in you more than you believing you [Music] believe in this that God wants to do something greater than you can imagine or think so I need you to get it together stop making me work so hard year after year hearing your little sad stories about them little jacked up relationships you keep getting it how about you get your mind right this year and stop worrying about everybody and your love life that's jacked up anyway it's sucking the life out of you anyway you're not getting anywhere you need to be how about you just focus on saying God doing me a new thing that's good and she's doing me a new thing out listen I'm following you wherever listen I'm I'm telling I told my circle at the top of the Year y'all we got to get it together [Music] we got to get it together some of y'all need to send a text to your group of friends we need to get it together [Applause] sick of us being broke [Applause] sick of paying the dinner bill every time we go out [Applause] that wasn't to anybody that wasn't to anybody [Applause] but I want the whole Community to be fighting for the bill this year because he's blessed us so well that we want to be a blessing and what he's doing in US is raising us up from our old place and Awakening our eyes to see that God is trying to do a new thing so here's today to believe it's that God has a loose shoe for a purpose so stop sitting down on your purpose believing that this is just any of the Year this is the year yeah
