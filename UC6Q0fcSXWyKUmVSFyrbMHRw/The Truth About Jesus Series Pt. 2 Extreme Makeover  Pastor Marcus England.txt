[Music] here's one thing i understand that the bible lets us know is that in genesis when the lord said it's not good that man should be alone he was not speaking to the reference of just marriage and relationships that were intimate he was talking about the presence of community there was something powerful in community community brings connection community brings correction community brings accountability community allows you the moment to see outside of yourself some of the things that you cannot perceive of yourself which gives you clarity and understanding that where i am is not where i used to be but where i am is not where i want to be and so community brings the accountability that says that i'm not just fine where i am but that god has more for me just tell your neighbor real quick god has more for you yeah yeah you may not have heard that this week you may not have heard someone say that to you in this life that you've been going through on this week but i just want to let you know that there is more for you and when you have the right people around you speaking the right things and clarity what they bring into an understanding is to say where you are isn't bad but i want to let you know where you're going is even better so we're grateful even if you try to put one or two three seats in the middle of you you're still around somebody somebody's got their eye on you you just tell your neighbor i got my eye on you good morning church good morning to those of you that are online welcome to the mix my name is marcus england and i'm the lead pastor here and i'm so grateful for this opportunity and time that we have together which i believe is impactful i believe if you made the decision to ride to come to park to be a part of this moment then that means god wants to impart something into your life that will not just manifest a good feeling but that will manifest change and that change you will see will make an impact on your life and not just on your life but the life of the community of people that god has called you to lead and i'm excited about that do i have any women in the house today come on listen i told y'all a couple weeks ago about this amazing moment that was going to happen on this weekend it's called confident and capable [Music] now what i want to let you know is that it is the saturday here's some of the issue seats spaces are real thin and so if you want to be a part you've got to get in somebody say now you got to get it now you got to push i'm trying to tell you it has literally gone quickly and we were just counting

bibles you need to pull out your pen and your pad your phone whatever is needed to be able to take in information because we say here that note takers are what world changes so tell your neighbor real quick you're a world changer all right now the next thing i need you to be able to do is connect in with the word of god through your bible or on screen because here we understand that readers are what readers are leaders so we are taking leadership here's where leadership takes the most prominence at it takes the most prominence in our own life we cannot lead others unless we lead ourselves well and so god is saying if you through this word can lead yourself you can have the ability to be able to lead those that are part of your life in your community at your job surrounding you and today i believe as we're in part two in our series the truth about jesus i truly believe that god is going to make an impact on your life let's dive into the word of god mark chapter six it's where we're going to start today mark chapter six and we're gonna start at verse one and we're gonna go to verse six and this is going to be really good for us today pray be a blessing into your spirit starting at verse 1 it says he speaking about jesus as we are a part of these gospels it says went away from there and came he left one place to come to another which was his hometown and it says and his disciples because discipling means to follow it says they followed him it says on the sabbath he begin to teach in the synagogue it says and many who heard him were astonished saying where did this man get these things what is the wisdom given to him how are such mighty works done by his hands is not this i want you to remember this verse is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joseph and judas and simon are not his sisters here with us and they took offense at what they became amazed about it says and jesus said to him a prophet is not without honor except in his home town and among his relatives and it says and in his own household and he could do no mighty work there except that he laid hands on a few sick people and he healed them and it says and he marveled i want you to catch that phrase because oftentimes people marveled at jesus but it says jesus marveled because of their own belief i want to come from the title today extreme makeover extreme makeover we're not going to be pulling out any cars or i'm not giving away any homes but we're going to talk about an extreme makeover today and i believe god is going to speak to us can we pray father in the name of jesus i believe in this moment you've given us opportunity and this space to be able to receive of your word what it is you want to say and so father we declare today that you would do something supernatural in us that can only come from your holy spirit in this place for we love you we honor you and we thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians can y'all give it up for our dream team in this place come on help me celebrate them big time what i think today that i want to talk about with the truth about jesus is understanding that our savior has the ability to do more than we could ever imagine or even think for the bible says it's according to the power that is at work within us i need you to understand today that there is power within you if you have received jesus christ as your lord and savior and if that is you today i want you to know that you've got some power there's some power that is residing within you there is some power that you have that isn't just the strength within your muscle but it is the power that has been given and besowed upon you that jesus is saying i have given it over to your life now here's what i want to let you know his first power is in the ability to save you from sin and death and if you have received jesus today i want to let you know that the bible lets us know that you shall have eternal life in him today isn't that a place just to worship and praise god right there at the moment that you have eternal life in jesus today some of you said no not really i would like more but i get it we'll get there the bible tells us that in our acceptance of jesus that we come to a place where we have life in him now if you look at your previous life pre-jesus some of you know that the life that you used to live is not the life that you love to talk about it's not the life that you love to put on the screen or to let everybody know about it's not the life that you love to just be able to show people and exclaim to people and and so some of us jumped at the opportunity to know jesus because you heard a preacher or you read in your bible that the word of god says that when you accept jesus he not only gives you eternal life but he makes you brand new and for some of us brand new was all we wanted i just want a brand new life i just want to leave what i used to do behind me i want to leave my past i want to leave the anger that resides on the inside of me i want to leave the attitude that i always seem to have i want to leave the fear and the doubts i want to leave the places where i have no joy and no rest i want to leave them behind can is there any part of your life that you can admit today that you would like to leave behind now some of you may be honest and some of you may not be honest if if we brought some of your past here today they will help convince you that all of your life has not been the best from the person that you laid hands on and i'm not talking about in a spiritual way from the person that you laid your lips on and i'm not talking about blessings i'm talking about curses to the life that you live for the decisions that you made that you said you would never do what you have done can i tell you today even for some of us that find ourselves to be good even though we talked about last week that there is only one good but the father those of us that have placed ourselves in the good space can i say this to you today the bible says yet you were still as filthy rags and all of your goodness and all of the things that you tried to be perfect at and all of the ways that you tried to keep the law in all of the things that you tried to do the bible says there is still an imperfection in us and he says i come to give you a new life and that life more abundantly that new life that he's looking at he's saying i'm coming to give you a makeover now i'm trying to tell you it's a makeover that he's saying i want to go into your life and look at some of the things that you put inside of you some of the things you opened your mind to some of the hurts that you have received some of the ways that you have been and he says i want to do a makeover now i don't know if you are like me but i i love a good show that's got a that's got a good heart-wrenching pull at you i i love the show extreme makeover anybody ever seen that show before extreme makeover wear where they go into an area they find a family in a home and and they look at the set of circumstances and they come to an agreement that this home needs some help and they go into the home and they look at where the home is and and they and they go about it and they say you know what we want to do something better for you now if you would be honest like i'm honest with some of you had this moment an opportunity to be able to say anybody in here can admit you need a little bit of a makeover anybody know about that you you you could use a makeover now now now i'm not just talking about outwardly even though some of us outwardly want to make over we we will ask lord lord i need you to make over my car because it's it's making some noises right now that did not come when i brought it out of the lot lord i need you to make that over lord i need you to make over my house because right now i'm not doing the best job and making it look like it's supposed to look i need to make over there some of you are saying lord i need a makeover outwardly because uh lately i've been neglecting myself but here's the makeover that jesus is most concerned about it is the makeover that we talked about in first samuel chapter 16 where he says man looks at the outward appearance but god looks at the thoughts and the intentions of a person and when he speaks about it he says i want to do something inside of you now if we could all be honest everyone likes their own way of looking everybody thinks they're good at a certain point but we all need a makeover just tell your neighbor real quick you could use a makeover that got offended it's okay they'll be all right tell them you can use a little bit of a makeover you could you can i mean just something to help you a little bit you could change that thing up just a little bit you could you could change that perfume that you've been wearing for 17 years now called sunflower and you smell like my grandmother's grandmother i'm going to tell you you can use a little bit of a makeover i'm not going to say anything about where you are in your life but i want to let you know you can use a little bit of a makeover some of us could use a little bit of upkeep a little bit of maintenance a little bit of things changing out to be new i know that's your favorite shirt but it's got so many stains on it that it needs to be incinerated and give it to the good will you need just a little bit of a makeover i need you to give away that that those pair of pants that you like and i know you love them and they're comfortable but they're starting to look and smell messed up i need you to get a little bit of a makeover we can use the makeover and the bible lets us know that jesus has said i've i've come to give you a makeover i've come to make you brand new on the inside i've come to share in some of the hurts that you have in some of the addictions that you've acquired and some of the broken spaces that you see in your life i've come to give you a makeover you've been doing that for so long that you've identified it as who you are and today the lord is saying it's not who you are it's what you did and if you could break yourself away from the things you did as being who you are you would understand you're greater than what you've seen yourself do [Applause] but some of us only make connection with what we've done and what we've done has defined who we are and who we are has created boundaries about who we can be some of you have been mothers for so long that you can't identify yourself as anything else outside of your children because your value and your identity comes only through [Music] what you have birthed can i tell you some men you define yourselves on the greatest moments of your life and you keep reintroducing yourself to that moment because it's who you think you were at the best moment in your life you talk about the sports you used to play even though it was 10 years ago you talk about the job you used to have even though it was 20 years ago here's what we have to understand is that god is calling to build us from where we are not at the greatest point of where we were some of us keep celebrating our past and we don't recognize by celebrating our past we're denying our present and we're giving no life into the present place that we are so that our present can be a propeller for where we're going it's hard to see where you're going when you're constantly looking in the rearview mirror of where you've come from where you come from is a reminder of the greatness of what god can do but it is not the place where you stay so that you can go no further it is an opportunity for you to see if god has brought me through that that means that i can get to something greater i don't have to stay where i am and what happened or used to be does not define my life [Applause] here's why because some of you have new vision some of you have new jobs new opportunities new perspectives you have new potentials that are arising but you will kill the seed of potential by still trying to pluck the plant a purpose of a previous season anybody knows that when you look at a dozen roses and a dozen tulips you love them they look beautiful you love admiring them but the problem is is that they only have a what lifespan from when you have pulled them from the ground to the place where now they look like they are supposed to what be given to someone else anybody i love my wife would love a baby here's some flowers babe this is so beautiful these are gorgeous two days later they're sitting in a vase with no water with the paper still wrapped around it because present seasons are seasons that we enjoy but they lose their impact because they aren't meant to last forever and some of us are draining our past accomplishments to sit in our present moments yet they are not fulfilling us enough to get from it what we need to nurture it because it's been uprooted because it's no longer in the same season of what we're supposed to be connected with so you're trying to get life from something that's over and is supposed to says this that everything has a purpose a time and a season and in the season you are supposed to enjoy it but you're not supposed to stay in the season of your past and pull from that season in order for you to be able to fulfill your future every week i got to buy new flowers why because the flowers that were before have died i try to keep them what going alive moving but the problem is is eventually they're gonna die and here's the thing when things die they make a mess and when they make a mess you got to go clean it up and some of us are spending so much time cleaning up our past that we have no time for our current present and our present needs attention because our future is thriving off of what we do now enemy is good at keeping you connected to your past so that you become overly bogged down and what focusing on what you used to so as you clean up your past your present is waiting and dying from malnutrition because you're so focused on getting what used to be right instead of getting what is together that's why we recognize jesus as i look at the scripture we're not talking today about how they just couldn't get that he was lord and savior today we're talking because they didn't recognize how great he is the bible says in verse 3 that they said isn't this the carpenter can i tell you that if they only knew what his occupation meant instead of what it is his occupation was a builder if you if you look in scripture he was able to build now we think carpenter in our today society as one who only has the ability to be able to deal with wood but the problem is is back in their day the way they built was according to stone and to metal and to wood and so jesus was versatile in multiple ways of being a builder and in this building people didn't notice that he has the ability to take old things and resurrect them what he's saying is in this extreme makeover today i want to talk to you about how god is trying to get a hold of your life to do a makeover that you are in need of and that i have a need for and he's saying today i don't just want to clean an area enough to make it livable i want to do a makeover so that it's customized to the life and the purpose that i have built for you anybody got a room in their house that they would just love to change like the carpet is just wearing you out you just if we could just get rid of this if we could just make something if we could just get can i tell you that many of us are looking at our lives currently and saying if i could just only change some of the aspects of my life to make it new i would love to see something different that represented who i truly am ain't nothing like walking into an old house and you get to see it you said that ain't that ain't how i would decorate it in here you know your grandmother's house that used to have the plastic on the couch and and when you when you sat down your legs would stick to it because it'd be so hot and when you get up you will heal the peeling noise that's from your thighs being on it and you get up and say oh my gosh why am i sweating right here and you would say i would never do that in my own house i'm just trying to ask you there's some things that when you look at where you came from and you look at your past you say it was good but i would change some things up i needed a little bit more modern i needed to look a little bit more like me jesus said i have customized a life that is perfect for who you are now and who you will be in the future and if you trust me i can do an extreme makeover in you everything that you set your knock he says i can change you into who i've called you to be some of you love people but say you hate them pastor i can't i just i can't do people i i just no no no here's what happened is that your old self didn't like people because of a past experience a past hurt a past brokenness or a broken home that you came out of that kept people at bay and so you think who you are is people less and god said i actually created you to be four people that's why he says this he says i'll make you new he says i'll recreate you i'll reformat you i'll i'll i'll i'll make you event i don't i don't speak pastor i just like to be in the background some but when i get with you in person you're talking my head off so it says you speak somewhere [Applause] can you tell your neighbor real quick you don't know all of who you are y'all ain't like that i saw y'all like now i'm pretty good with this person some of you are settled you settled into who you are you settled into the way that you dress you settled into the way that you talk you settled into the way that you date you settled into the way that you connect with people you've just settled and you say this is me i can't change i don't want to change i want to be this way and i want to stay this way and god says i have somebody greater on the inside of you that i want to do an extreme makeover i've actually seen your condition here's what used to happen in extreme makeover the people were still happy even though they were in broken conditions because they learned to be okay with the broken conditions because they never thought it would be possible that any other condition could exist because they didn't have the resources to change where they were and who they were problem is is that they didn't understand is that resources lie outside of who we are if we have enough belief and hope that something else can change it would be real good because they would come and they would knock on their door and say hey we want to let you know smith's family we're here to do a makeover and the people will come out and they will come out screaming and losing their mind because what they could not believe is that something in their life could change from where it is to where it could be and they would send the people away you ever thought about they sent the people away to go on vacation when they sent the people away to go on vacation the people in the community who gave up their time and effort came in to change and do the makeover while the people didn't do anything on the side why why because if they had the ability to change their surroundings they would have done it themselves but what they needed to do was call in a specialist that knows how to actually create what it is that they could never imagine [Applause] in creating it they will have the opportunity to see something that they never thought was available how about when you come into relationship with jesus you take your hands off of you i can't preach that because if you knew what to do with you you would have done it a long time ago you need a specialist and when it comes to building there's a specific kind of specialist and a contractor that you need and the bible says in verse 3 of mark chapter 6 isn't this the carpenter the carpenter of your life that's called to build you and to resurrect you into who god has called for you to be is it possible that jesus specializes in people with anger issues and addictive behavior and broken mindsets is it possible that he could come in and change your situation because he's a specialist [Applause] see the first thing that you've got to understand with the people that they brought in that they had done this before they had done makeovers they had done changes they had built homes before and they weren't coming into a new space that's why they had the ability to think further than the individuals living in the space god can see further than you can even though you've been in your body all your life you're like no i know me and he's like i think i know you a little bit better you're like nah no way he's like i'm pretty sure because in scripture it says before the foundation of the world i knew you before you were even in your mother's womb i knew you and you're like well jesus you know me but you don't really know me he says i know everything about you everything that's possible with who you are everything that you cowered away from every fear that you have on the inside everything that you push to the side that puts you in a place where you don't want to provoke the you that you really are you just want to stay comfortable in the things that represent who you know to be because when you stay where you are you can be who you know to be which means you don't need to change anything about you nor recognize that there's some issues that you have as perfect as you think you are let me talk to my single folk real quick y'all y'all know about this dating online where you got to create the profile and some of us love creating these profiles that put things together to make us look like our best attributes that are possible and when you create it you put it together and you tell the people this is what i'm doing this is the degree i'm calling after this is how many times i've been successful uh this is the place i am in my life and here's what you start to let people know this is what i'm not tolerating this is what i won't do this is how i'm not handling the problem is is we'll do that with outside relationships but we won't do that with spiritual relationships how about you create a profile for you who you really are to jesus jacked up cussed a couple times this week laid my husband out laid my wife out didn't like what anyone said to me i gave people to eye when they rolled past me i almost smacked shorty when she got in my face [Applause] i don't know how to manage money if i did i would save it the way i was supposed to that's your real profile that's y that's your real profile i get an attitude most of the time i keep my mouth shut and give you a stare as if to say don't you even dare look at me say nothing to me talk about me some of you doing it right now pastor don't come in this section no more looking at me you should have watched online cause i'm coming in your section [Applause] and that's the real profile of us i don't like to be annoyed don't pry too far into my business because my business is real private and personal don't get into how much i how i think in the way that i act because if so i might have to tell you a little bit about myself and if i got to tell you about myself then it means i might have to admit who i really am at times when the times i want to give you a persona as how perfect i am and how together i have it and how my my mindset is so perfect on everything when the real thing is is i get scared and i have fearful moments and i don't know what i'm doing all the time and i don't operate in faith like i'm supposed to and i jump from thing to thing because i don't know what i'm doing with my life and addiction catches me every other day if i don't get into it and i look at stuff i shouldn't and i get my mind wrapped around things i shouldn't and i get in relationships that are destructive and i go missing all the time and i don't like talking to nobody and i haven't gotten my mess he is saying if you could be you he could do an extreme makeover to who he's called you to be [Applause] because nobody cares about your previous title and your previous position and how many things you have accomplished god is saying what are you doing with me today stop introducing your past self as the accomplishment of your present day because what it does is it makes you unaccountable to what you're doing now you know i used to well here i wanna hear about what you used to what are you doing now where are you going now who are you seeking help from now where are you getting now don't tell me about all the accomplishments that you used to do i need to know where are you in your life right now where are you spiritually growing now where do you have accountability now where is your anointing now i used to i used to preach the house down you preaching now well no cause well let's talk about where you are now so the same anointing that you had can be the same anointing that you have and then the same anointing that you will have the first point that i really want to help you to understand with knowing the truth about jesus is that jesus sets our foundation the scripture lets us know in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. it says no one can lay any other foundation besides the one that is already laid which is jesus christ so i want to get you on clarity if your foundation is not based off of jesus christ you have the wrong foundation if it's based off of another god if it's based off of another perspective if it's not based off the word of the living god then what you have is a broken foundation and a broken foundation will mess you up when you're ready to build can i tell you real quick if you don't set your foundation upon your marriage on jesus you're going to set your foundation on something faulty if you don't set your foundation of relationships on jesus you're going to set it on something faulty and what's faulty is whatever the world says it is because there's only two people that you're going to serve the bible says you either serve god or mammon and it talks about the spirit of money the spirit of greed the spirit of whatever the world wants to be so if you don't build your foundation on christ what will you base your structure on if you build your foundation based on your opinion you will build your foundation opinionated which means when an opinion changes the foundation changes because i need my foundation to last through some storms some of us the reason that we keep shifting and changing and moving and going is because our foundation is based upon something listen here here's one of the things i have learned and that is coming out and you guys may don't take a look at this often but it's in the christian world is that it's recognizing that christians don't have an understanding of god's word enough to have a foundation that is set on it that's why they will change opinions according to the culture because they don't have a basis on the foundation of the word of god so that's why you get shift shaping christians based on where they are and what they feel and god is saying when you base your foundation on me guess what nothing changes the idea today is do you actually believe you need a makeover anybody ever been there before i think i'm good i'm good i look good i'm good i'm good you think i'm good i'm good so i asked some people are you good i'm good i think i'm good i think i'm real good i think i'm good here's why another reason we think we're good because we've exceeded our own expectations and once you exceed what you thought you were going to do you have nothing else to do i didn't think i was going to graduate i graduate well great well i'm playing for nothing else so we're good we're good yep i'm good yeah this is great i never thought i'd make greater than 50 000 this is great the problem is is when you exceed your expectation you have nothing to look forward to until there's a new expectation but the new expectation can only come from the purpose in which god has already placed over your life so the question is is what else are you expecting because once you achieve what you expect there's nothing else to expect [Music] i never thought i would have this business now you got it now what oh i'm supposed to do more yeah what why have breath if you're going to do what you just was already doing it's done it's over you achieved it now what you're telling me i got to do more yup yup i'm telling you have to do more because if you don't do more and you build your foundation on something that's broken the idea that you get from it is as soon as the winds hit you will go down bible says matthew chapter 7 verse 24. i want you to hear this this is a context that jesus gives his disciples letting them know this is what happens when you build on faulty ground he says everyone then who hears these words of mines and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat on the house but it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock well pastor who was the rock jesus not the one from wwf jesus is that rock and it says and everyone who hears these words of minds and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell here's the last part it says and great was the fall of it when you don't build upon christ your falls are so massive that you rarely recover from them like you're supposed to because you have nothing that it's been built upon that's strong enough to hold the foundation of where you're going so when your opinions and your ideologies are built into the foundation the bible says when life comes it will smack you and when it smacks you you will get back up and be like who did that it says but when you built your your house on the rock the strong foundation it says winds can blow and things can happen and and and tormenting torrential rains and storms can come in and it says in in doing so you'll manifest see here's the problem we have taught people that spontaneous is living and consistency is boring but the problem is it's harder to be consistent than it is to be spontaneous let me let me go back in today back in the day we used to come home from church some of us i'm not saying everybody and you knew that you could go to your grandmother's house in your mother's house to eat dinner because she cooked every sunday you know you could rely on it and it was consistent some of you will starve today [Applause] because you have no clue of what you're going to eat because consistency requires thinking thinking brings about planning planning produces preparation and preparation gives you an idea of a schedule and a schedule takes you into a place of consistency you're not planning so you don't need to think so you're living spontaneously every day because you think waking up and feeling what you want to do is more important than planning who you want to be oh this is good i'm trying to tell you because this stuff can change your life if you get it right because those of us that don't have a plan have not prepared and when we don't prepare we're not in expectation and when we have no expectation we're not considering what god can do and will do so you get up according to what you feel instead of the vision of what you have [Applause] stop chumping a schedule and consistency because you want to get up and live the day out the master builder is on a schedule and he's only got but a certain time in your life to complete the project either you will be on time with building or you will be on your own time frame doing it when you want and doing it how you want and if you can't get in your mind that the time on this earth is limited and that everything expires eventually you'll never get that you have to fulfill what god is calling for you to do so that means you have to plan for where you're going and not just feel it according to where you are question is do you know what you're doing when you get home today do you know where you're going no i just like to be free problem is is free get you into a messed up place where you have no intentionality in who you're going to be pastor you know i just i like to live it out i don't like a lot of pressure i just want to keep balance i want to be overwhelmed because this world will overwhelm you problem is you haven't read your word because in john 16 33 he says in this life you will have trouble but take heart i've overcome the world so it must mean that they're going to be some pressures that happen in life and here's the problem christians who avoid pressure avoid making so you stay where you are oh my gosh point number two point number two jesus understands our structure pastor you don't know me i get overwhelmed quickly anxiety builds in i'm not trying to you know you gotta keep it don't wanna you know hey i gotta balance go gotta of balance the problem is is that you keep basing your balance on a fear of what being unbalanced can get you because you're fearful of where you could go so you rather rest at where you are and if i rest where i am then i control the narrative of the basis of keeping myself because god forbid god keep me because i'm always trying to balance my own life so that i never experience what it is to be outside of the realm of control god forbid i lose control and give it over to god and he have to regulate my feelings and my emotions because some world culture told me that in this world i should be leveled and balanced tell me in scripture where somalia was leveled and balanced noah go build the art it's never rain i don't care that's gonna stress me out lord [Applause] you want me to like work two days take a break go on vacation come back if you do you'll drown i suggest you work on this over and over and continuously but that's not balance with my family you'll lose your family if you don't learn to follow me oh okay all right i guess so and then we're going to bring in animals two by two god no no no no i draw the line no jesus is saying in order to be who i've called for you to be you've laid yourself as a living sacrifice on an altar which means you lose control i love people who tell me i work too much when their whole ideal of life is working less i said do you know how many souls need to be saved i just i don't need that kind of prayer you need to calm down and take care of yourself i haven't been taking care of myself since i've been born jesus has been doing this anyway you need to make sure no i need to make sure that when i get to him i'm not telling him how i wanted a balance i want to get to him and he says well done that good and faithful servant that's my result let your result be balance calmness serenity peace i have peace in storms because my foundation is on something different i have expectations that cannot be achieved by what i can see myself doing of myself and without the schedule and without the vision and without the preparation i will never see myself getting to the place that god has called for me to be as an individual when you leave out of here when i leave out of here when you leave out of here there should be something missing in the earth because you are absent not a sense of well let's just keep going on because everything is the same way it was before because your life made no [Music] impact people should be scrambling when you're leaving this earth trying to figure out what they're going to do because you're gone because there's only one of you that could do what you're doing the problem is is that if we're copying what everyone else is doing you're nothing but a copied to the purpose of someone else so it's easy to replace you when you're gone you should be at your job working at such a point that when you go missing they don't even know what to do in the department anymore you know ronald's gone oh my god [Applause] [Music] ronald's gone he's gone shut the building now cause ronald did everything he kept peace ronald was in a phenomenal leader ronald kept things going some of us go off of facebook and tell people we're back and we're looking at you to say i never knew you were gone [Applause] you think your presence is that much everybody else sees your presence as just something to be replaced how about you live out a life that cannot be replaced if i'm out of here y'all gonna be like we're gonna run this church we might as well close it i don't know what we're gonna do around here now are you saying pastor that jesus can bring somebody in yes i'm saying he can but what i'm saying is my life fingerprint should be so great that it's complicated to replace me the only person that's going to miss you is you [Applause] [Music] hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 says jesus our high priest is able to understand our weaknesses since when jesus lived on the earth he was tempted in every way every way every way every way imbalance pressure hurt pain he said he was tempted in every way so he was tempted in the same ways we're tempted the bible says though he never sinned i'm here today to let you know that he understands your structure you understand you can be a little off sometimes he understands like me you can be a little bit passionate a little riled up he he understands everything about you and the nuances and the complexities but he understands he made you unique and whatever you're trying to copy you're doing yourself a disservice because whatever you copy means you can be replaced are you living out a life that is irreplaceable because you allowed the master builder to do an extreme makeover inside of you that there is no other copy of you available i tell my team this all the time and i'm wrapping up i tell them i say this i said if you go on vacation and we don't struggle you're not doing your job if you missing i don't even know you missing there's something wrong i tell our team pay unpaid forced oh here they are the question is has the master builder done such a job in you that you're irreplaceable or do you just look like the carbon copy of what everyone else is you just have a different face i'm interested what kind of impact is your life making what kind of you're so great and so loving so amazing but the question is would people get a relief from you being away or would they feel like the whole world is destructive here's why when jesus died the disciples lost it they went hiding in the room and just said we're next we're next we're nuts we're gonna die we're gonna die y'all we're gonna die we're next there was nobody like him we thought he was gonna the bible says she shows up rises from the grave and they're like no wait what he rose like yeah yeah yeah i'm master rose and the bible lets us know he knew how much they still needed him so that's why he left the person of the holy spirit so the impact that they had while they were with him they could have when he was gone it would just be through the person of the holy spirit in each of them my last point is this it's for the controlled person like myself who wants to have it all together it says it's in point number three jesus bears every week you're trying to figure out in your life pastor how am i going to do all this jesus says i didn't call for you to figure it out i called for you to trust in me i called for you to lean and depend on me i call for you to give all your clarity and understanding to me i call for you to be the one that arrested me i called for you to put all your anguishes and your hurts and your problems and your disappointments i called for them to be all in me i need you to trust me and if you could trust me you can learn that even when times get hard you would stop avoiding hard times because you can bear the weight on me it says i'm your i'm your burden bear god she cares on me i care for you and you stop approaching everything so fearful you know i don't want to do that because you know it takes up all my time and if i do that it's going to weigh me down and if you know i can't i only can give you once a month jesus and all that and jesus says and it's that that keeps you from being who i've called you to be because you don't cast your cares on me you keep your cares from me by doing less than what i've called you to be because you could think god knows if i really want to be everything that god has put in my heart to be man that's going to wear me out god says yup that's what your life should be a worn worn-out wife i'mma say this last piece it's not at everybody it's just that somebody you're tired all the time because you have nothing active in your life to keep you awoke you're bored with you so the only thing to fill it is to sleep on yourself let me tell you why church isn't interesting because you're not looking to grow or learn [Music] so you'll stay where you are and you're not like oh if god says that thing oh if i can if he give me a word i promise no we'll stay where you are because you're satisfied with who you are and you're not expecting anything greater come out with notepads pins bibles when i even study for god's word i have extra stuff that i don't even get to y'all about that god is speaking to me because i'm just interested in growing and knowing who he is because he's still doing an extreme makeover on the inside of me and i want to win i leave this world the imprint to be left in this world that i made such an impact that i changed lives forever not popular impactful scripture says in acts 4 and 11 as we close he says christ is the stone that was put aside by you workmen but he has become the most important stone in the building bible lets us know that there is a cornerstone he another version says he's the chief corner stone well what's about the cornerstone the cornerstone is where all of the weight of the building rests upon every floor every piece every every structure point it all rests on the cornerstone jesus is saying today i am your cornerstone i can fulfill every weight i can i can meet every place every measure of your life but you're gonna need an extreme makeover exactly what is that going to require from me that's going to require you wait is it just my time jesus says i don't want fragments of you i want all of you can you just tell your neighbor real quick just like does this say like he kind of wants it all he kind of wants it all you're most impressive when you're being everything god's called you to be i'm gonna tell you in this season of your life is god is calling you to greatness don't you sleep on your moment don't you walk away expecting that god's going to do it because you're a good person salvation does not mean you will fulfill the call it means you will be saved for eternity let's not get churched and the purpose of leaning to god's plan mixed up you meet him in eternity but he will ask you what did you do you're gonna say what i just lived for you i stayed good i went to church i said do you know i created you for way more than that hey i created you to make a ruckus in the earth that's my last point that's not a point which is something i want to say are the people around you pushing you so much that you want to run from them because they're expecting out of you things that you would never expect out of yourself if that's not your circle today then i'm going to tell you you got to change your circle [Applause] as you're expecting a makeover you've got to have the right people in your life that know the right things to do to have the right moments to say the right things so that god can bring change to what you want to see [Music] and here's what i believe is in this moment god wants to do something greater than you could ever imagine
