[Music] i pray goddess those of you who've been here since day one that there's a special year of favor for you amen numbers chapter 1 and the lord spoke to moses saying send men to spy out the land of caden which i am giving to the children of israel from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man everyone a leader among them it's crazy when god has a gift for you but you got to get through something to get it man god it's a gift why is this hard it's a gift i thought a gift was free come on somebody i gave it it is free but i want to make sure that you steward it well when i give it to you so i'm gonna give you some tests to see if you've made it about you or you've made it about me so it is free but there is some prelude trials that you got to go through to make sure that it won't slip through your hands when i give it to you and so here we have the israelites and you know the story have been 400 years in captivity in egypt and god sends moses to go to pharaoh to say let my people go and i'm going to fast forward through the context of this and moses goes to pharaoh after hearing the voice of god clearly at a burning bush and i love the fact that the beginning of this whole passage god says take your shoes off i want to talk to you because where this place is or the place that i have for you is holy ground it was the same ground that he walked on it was the same ground where he did dirt in it was the same ground where he traveled for years it would be the same ground where he committed murder but god says when i talk to you and i add this call on the other side of your catastrophe i'm gonna make this place holy ground and everywhere that your foot shreds it won't be hard it'll be holy so what i need to do now is i want you to select 12 liters i'm going to send 12 people out to spy out this holy ground and when i send these 12 leaders i want these 12 leaders i need them to understand that i am selecting them not because they're all that but i'm selecting them because they recognize that there's a generation behind them that's at stake in other words their holiness is not just up to them their holiness what's at stake is generations behind them i want you to know that th that the presence of god that they carry is not just for them that their prayer time is not just for them that their intercession is not just for them that their fasting is not just for them that their breakthrough is not just for them could it be that you thought it was just for you so you had time to to play and go through cycles you had time come on somebody just give me one more week to do this dirt god just let me be ratchet a little bit longer but what you don't understand is there are generations of people waiting for you to walk in the purposes and call that god has for you so you represent the 12 leaders i got to break addictions because i need to pass down the anointing to break addictions i gotta get healed because everything i get healed from now i have the anointing for other people behind me to get healed [Music] so then he goes on these 12 go out into the land and pick it up at numbers 13 17-20 then moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said to them go up this way into the south and go up to the mountains and i love this and i want y'all to focus on this and see what the land is like not see what the provision is like not see come on somebody what the stores look like not see what the finances are gonna look like i i want you to see what the land is like okay okay i get that whether the people who dwell in the land are weak or strong in other words i want you to see what the land has produced has the land produced strength or weakness in the people in other words the people will be strong based on the condition of holy ground they can't get strong from just reading their word they're not going to get strong from just being in the presence of god they have to be in the place that i have designed them to be in in other words if it slips through your hands and you find yourself in a cycle it's probably not your effort that's the issue it's probably the place that's the issue i'm gonna keep going y'all like what is he talking about whether the land they dwell in is good or bad whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds 20. then it says this whether the land is rich or poor and watch it whether there are forests there or not don't look for bushes don't look for little budding trees see if the land has produced some maturity maturity that has multiplied forests it doesn't even say look for a strong tree it says see if there are a lot of trees that are proven i'm going somewhere be of good courage and i love this and then bring me back some fruit from the land bring me back proof that god is in this yeah i don't hear what i'm saying bring me back some fruit of what this particular season has produced because then it says this because now was the time or was the season of the first ripe grapes the first ripe grapes in other words there's a window a season where the land is going to produce something as proof that you're not supposed to stay where you've been but the land is supposed to call you to a new place i need you to go and bring some fruit back to show me if god was there i want to preach to your mixed church for the next 30 minutes from the topic occupy somebody say occupy in jesus name amen thank you my brother i get an opportunity to travel or travel around the country and and and bring god's word and unfold god's word to people and see people healed set free and delivered and what an honor it is to be able to have a part in declaring god's word over people and oftentimes when i travel when i show up the church will give me a gift card and i'm honored i'm so honored to get a gift card and so i get a gift card and often times i forget about the gift card because i'm so focused on the assignment and so i get back home and i say did you get a gift card give it to me come on somebody. she says i gifted that church with your presence so whatever happened there belongs to me come on somebody and oftentimes she forgets about the gift card and a few months ago i was going through my bag and recognized and don't judge me okay i had forgot about a gift card that was in my bag and and i was going through my bag to clean out the trash in the bag and i realized that i had a a gift card to nordstrom come on somebody and it had 300 on it come on somebody and i put five on it it's a hard light light that's when slow jams is good that's a whole nother message and i and i thought to myself how many people have been gifted something but forgot about it because of seasons that have happened how many people have been promised something from god and have not transacted with it and so what i did is i did a little research and i found out that right now there is 15 billion dollars that people have in their possession that they have not used fifth teen billion dollars in the us some of those people have prayed for god to bless them financially and he has but what he's blessed them with has gone unused and unoccupied oh y'all don't hear what i'm saying why could it be that god has already given you everything that you need but you lost the desire to transact with it to look for it because you have been stuck between a prayer and a promise for too long could the weight have made you tired could the stress have made you tired could the pain of addiction of fear have made you forget about that the promises of god are not maybe and sometimes but yes and amen i also found out that in the u.s there are hundreds of thousands of acres that belong to families and people with a certain last name but that land has gone unoccupied so that land after a season of time that no one claims it it goes back to the government and then the government will auction it off isn't it crazy to me that there are people out there right now in the world who are land owners but have a rental mentality and if you have a rental mentality you don't have the authority that you should have come on somebody as a land owner when you rent something you can't make the changes that somebody who owns can make come on y'all don't want to go at me right now when you're renting something you can't decide when to kick something out or to give it an eviction notice when you are just renting something i'm preaching better than y'all responding right now you can't decide what color you're going to paint the walls you can't decide that it's time to remodel you can't decide that it's time to have some reconstruction why because renting means that somebody else owns it the israelites were renting outside of egypt and before the side of their promised land they had a rental mentality the rental mentality was no place to call home the rental mentality was like when is this going to run out the rental mentality was uh complaining watch this the rental mentality prayed for manna prayed for something to eat and god rained down manna from heaven but the rental mentality started asking god and telling god that's not good enough the rental mentality come on somebody built idols in between seasons they worship the false god the rental mentality did not know how to hold up the arms of their leader because they focused more on who hurt them rather than who god sent to help them it's a rental mentality the rental mentality i'm telling y'all right now the children of israel the children of israel what happened it says that they were enslaved for over 400 years now i want you to understand something not a few people you see in that time they only counted foot soldiers they only counted men so the bible says 600 000 foot soldiers there were millions of people in between two seasons with a rental mentality but only about 12. you all don't hear what i'm saying could be considered as leaders to break the curse of average to break the curse watch this of i may not be where i want to be but i'm okay that i'm not where i used to be god did not send his son jesus to walk this earth for 30 years y'all don't hear what i'm saying he did not send his son jesus to go in an assignment for three and a half years come on somebody to hang on a cross to redefine death for you to be okay with average for you to be okay with a portion of a promise for you to be okay with at least i'm not broke but if you're not prospering you are not where god has called you to be god did not free you to stay in fear somebody shout this right now just because i'm free doesn't mean god is finished come on say girl come on tell three or four people just because you are free does not mean god is finished is there anybody in the building today that says where i am is not good enough where i am god has more in store for me my best days are ahead of me and my worst days are behind me don't get settled with mundane and average where am i single people that raise your hands come on y'all don't accept an in-between date if they not marriage material kick them to the curb if they don't have a prayer life now they won't have a prayer life then y'all don't hear what i'm saying marriage don't fix anything it multiplies everything and if they jacked up now you can't fix them some of you have to be careful that you have a promised land mentality but you connecting yourself with somebody who has an in-between rental mentality and if you got a rental mentality boyfriend spouse guess what you're just renting where am i married where my people have been divorced that come on raise your hand where your head right here you see it just because it's your second time don't mean you should settle for second best second best is a rental mentality i prophesy that come on somebody somebody is getting to the place that if i got a gift card i'm gonna use it i'm gonna maximize it if i got a promise i'm not stopping until i see come on somebody the goodness of god in the land of the living mixed church this ain't it god has more and stood look at the top three people on the show tell them this ain't it the hair do you got right now ain't it the clothes you got on right now ain't it the presence of god that you felt in the building this morning it's just a taste of what god has how do i know because everything that god has done in your life up to this point is just a taste of what he has in store for you god's best blessing yesterday will be his worst doing tomorrow because he takes you from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory i came to tell you mixed church you ain't seen nothing come on ark you pie you mean to tell me that there are prayers miss joyce that you prayed that your mama and daddy pray that marcus and michi don't even know about that they get to walk in do you know why people who they're in their name's sake on land watch this now and now the next generation doesn't know about it and now they're renting you know why because the people who prayed for it they did not send a forwarding address ahead y'all don't know what i'm saying right now i looked it up online and i asked siri siri come on somebody why do people go on occupied land and siri said there are two reasons are y'all ready the people don't know who they are they don't realize that i'm connected to something bigger than me they don't realize that i am an heir of the kingdom of god they don't realize that i have a supernatural hookup come on mix if your cousin worked at popeye's you would show up to the window expecting a few free nuggets come on somebody why just because you have the same name i came to tell you that you are not a citizen of earth you are a citizen of heaven and you need to walk in the bank like i got a hookup because god is with [Applause] [Music] they don't know who they are and the previous generation hasn't spoken over them as a forwarding address how in the world are you going to be free from egypt and think just because you're out of egypt that god is done now listen y'all it took me about 25 minutes to get to church this morning from my house in annapolis i was speeding why because i have expectation because there was an assignment i don't hear what i'm saying because i knew that there was an anointing here how in the world you've been enslaved for 400 years and you're going to allow a 40-day journey to turn into 40 years what in the world if i if i told pastor marcus that i'll be there in 25 minutes and it took 50 minutes he would be concerned that i'd get in an accident he would be concerned that something happened i want to know if there's a church that's concerned that the generation that the that the world is not walking in their purpose and destiny i want to know if there's a person saying what is going on in my family we've somebody's got to arrive at the destination can you imagine you know every new year's eve we we want to make a new year's resolution come on new year's is a good time to set new goals you know that only 80 i mean that 87 of people who make a new goal at a new year fail and i said god why and he said because a new goal without taking new ground equals old results you got to know your forward address you got to know who you are and so mix church very quickly i'm going to preach to you two of the four the first one is ground my points are ground grapes giants and grasshoppers see what the land is like is it is the people that are strong or weak we have to take ground mama joyce do you know that god only made ground once in genesis he made the heavens and the earth and what he said was it's good in other words i don't need to better what i already did the ground is good you know what he's not doing he's not making more ground but yet when he made us he gives us the command to be fruitful multiply and subdue in other words he's saying i'm not making new ground but i need you to make new space on the ground i've already created and then he introduced a word called dominion and that word dominion is the king's domain that word dominion he's saying this he's saying i want you now to populate the ground that i made on earth with common somebody the glory that i have in heaven so i'm gonna send jesus and jesus is going to teach you how to pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven in other words i gotta fear figure out how do i get the ground that's in heaven come on somebody to the groanings that's going on in earth the only way that you can take more ground is supernaturally because naturally he ain't making no more ground so what he says is when you get saved you become a kingdom agent and what i need you to do is to colonize earth with the ground and the glory that's in heaven and so when you place your feet somewhere i need you to make it move from hard to holy so how do i do that well 2nd chronicles 7 14 gives us an indication if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves come on look at the person next to you and says you ain't all that come on tell them he's not talking to the world he's talking to the church and he's saying if the church would understand that you have to break the spirit of pride and the only way that you can break the spirit of pride is with the presence of god if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and then what pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their ground the ground of your anxiety has to be healed anxiety will never cease until you take the ground of your mind how do i take the ground of my mind well paul says that i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you would offer yourself as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto me how do you do that be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind mixed church the enemy will never get under your feet until you get them out of your head [Applause] ground ground spiritual authority i have to take ground janelle we gotta take ground devin we gotta take ground maya we gotta take ground in other words if you ain't pray about it don't complain about it [Music] some of you have been gossiping with defeat to yourself too long the voices in your head is gossiping words that are contrary to god's word do you know what a stronghold is it is an accusation or a lie that the enemy plants in the minds of believers that are contrary to the word of god it's impossible to take ground just because you fasted just because you went to church just because you are in the presence of god watch this now unless the atmosphere that you are praying and in transforms your mind so you stop speaking death over yourself god's glory does not compete with our gossip stop telling yourself i'll never have this i'm always stuck in this that is contrary god i must that day that god made me i came i must have skipped the assembly line that had it all together no say i am fearfully and wonderfully made say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you got to take ground i am set apart come on somebody i i'm not crazy it takes crazy to have crazy faith god god has positioned me come on somebody you got to take ground i'm trying to give you all some steps some of y'all looking at me like i'm crazy and it's fine always be broke and it's cool keep going to counseling it doesn't work without the counsel of the holy spirit count that there's always a supernatural process to a natural process i have to go to counseling but i also need the counsel of the holy spirit y'all don't hear what i'm saying [Applause] taking ground i have come to understand devin something i didn't say this the other night when i preached this message but i realized that this is how i fight my battles not this and some of you used to be real nice at throwing hands but you've been horrible at laying hands or putting your hands up in the air because this posture is the posture of humility and the only way you break pride is if you drop to your knees when i make contact with heaven god makes a contract with earth y'all better shout right there heaven is not a place that you just go to when you die heaven is an atmosphere that can show up in the mall in the car come on somebody in the shower i get my best revelations in the shower come on somebody i think that that is a prophetic demonstration that when i get clean god comes and cleans house how do i know this because david talked about this after the 23rd psalm he said lift up your come on somebody heads on your gates he everlasting father and the king of glory shall come in he says who is the king of glory the lord god strong and mighty who may enter or ascend to the hill of the lord watches he who has a clean hands and a pure ground we gotta take ground gotta take ground uh i gotta my neighbor i moved in a house in 2005 and keep a plate and come back i moved in the house in 2005 and all right you can start playing this is how i fight my battles and uh my neighbor we had a competition of green grass now i ain't never had nothing right but i was the only black dude in the neighborhood so i wasn't gonna have the worst lawn so i started growing grass because i hired a good company come on somebody and i noticed something marcus pastor she started cutting in my yard she didn't know where the property line was come on somebody and i was got upset at first but then i realized something she's maintaining what's mine for free come on somebody so i just kept letting her cut further and she would clean up the leaves in my yard she would cut my yard she would fertilize my yard and i was comfortable with it until until i wanted to build something and when i wanted to build something i had to then say am i good with her maintaining what's mine oh y'all don't hear what i'm saying what i'm saying some of you ain't free it is a it is a setup that the enemy has been maintaining what y'all don't hear what i'm saying what properly belongs to you and if you got children social media is not supposed to maintain your children if you got children youtube is not supposed to maintain your children the enemy has been cutting and taking care of your stuff for too long so i had to call a surveyor and i called a surveyor and the surveyor showed up and said this ma'am this line is his that's yours this is his and i started to build mixed church i came as a prophetic surveyor today that said where you are is not where you're going to be god is about to expand you to the left and to the right god has more in store for you somebody says oh god that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory [Music] i found out something [Music] that if i don't take it in the spirit i'll never have it in a natural some of you right now you need to give the enemy an eviction notice your feet right now every devil in hell has to flee my mind [Music] every nasty compromising spirit has to go out of the territory of my heart god change my affections you got to learn how to take the territory of your mind you got to learn how to take the territory of your heart watch this now you got to learn to take the territory of your emotions i i've been asking the lord mama joyce to change my affections away from worldly things to worshipful things and you know what that takes guys honesty i believe that the greatest move that god wants to do in this next uh realm in this next season in this next time and in your life is depending on one thing honesty honesty god sometimes i think nasty thoughts god sometimes i'm not who i want to be sometimes i'm resentful sometimes i'm vindictive sometimes i cuss come on somebody and i believe that as we take the territory i'm gonna make it as simple as this come on somebody it's called confession it's called every day just saying god i i i just need you to help me god today i'ma give you this last point in two minutes i want to talk about grapes i want you to stand keep standing it won't be long but they said bring me back some grapes as proof these are really good y'all and i hope whoever bought them wash their hands because i don't want cocaine [Music] the bible specifically says marcus that the grapes were so big it took two men [Music] when i read the passage were the grapes that big really or was it the fact that grasshoppers were carrying them [Music] the bible says that they saw themselves as grasshoppers in other words how you see yourself will be how you the enemy sees you [Music] but they brought back one cluster now imagine this they go to the promised land they experience it they bring back fruit to the layover season and they start eating have you ever been to costco sam's [Music] you know what they have you know what costco and sam's are really good at temptation [Music] because when a new product comes out there's a person standing there with a sample [Music] and they they hunt you down to taste the sample come on somebody have you ever been to costco and you ate so many samples that you forgot what you really came for and you realize that the samples that were supposed to be an appetizer became appetizing and you lost your hunger for the soil because you were okay with the fruit i came to tell you mixed church don't you dare settle for a sample don't you dare settle for halfway i came to i came to prophesy would you rather have the fruit in your hand or the sawyer where the fruit came from i want you to know in seven years mixed church god has done amazing things he has parted the red sea he has rained down manna he has led you by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night but i came to prophesy that was just a sample [Music] you only get one if you settle [Music] but if you keep pressing to the promised land [Music] it multiplies because the place that you have is holy ground i want to pray for you
