[Music] so i'm gonna be following pastor marcus in his uh sermon series where we're talking about the truth about jesus and this morning i'm going to be talking to you about how jesus is the king anybody know jesus is the king he's lots of things he's a teacher he's a prophet right pastor marcus talked about yesterday last week he's that he's a savior he came to rescue and redeemed but he's also the king and he's worthy [Music] so i'm going to be reading to you this morning we're going to take our text from luke chapter 7 verses 1 through 10. i'm using the esv the english standard version just so you all know this is one of my favorite passages of scripture after he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death who was highly valued by him and when the centurion heard about jesus he sent to him elders of the jews asking him to come heal his servant and when they came to jesus they pleaded with him earnestly saying he's worthy to have you do this for him for he loves our nation and he is the one who built our synagogue and jesus went with them when he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends saying to him lord do not trouble yourself for i'm not worthy to have you come under my roof therefore i did not presume to come to you but say the word [Music] everybody just say say the word [Music] say the word and let my servant be healed for i too am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turning to the crowd that followed him said i tell you not even in israel have i found such faith and when those who had seen who had been sent returned to the house they found the servant well so jesus we submit ourselves to your word this morning spirit come open our eyes to see open our ears to hear open our minds to understand in our hearts to receive all that you have for us from your word this morning we asked jesus that we would leave here changed and not the same because of your word so come jesus come holy spirit give us revelation [Music] how many of you think we should pay attention when the word says that jesus marveled how many times has jesus said he's marveled twice here and when he preaches at nazareth and he marvels at their lack of faith because when he preached the word and healed the sick only a few got healed now lots of us would be pretty excited if just a few got healed right jesus is like nope i was looking for more here he's marveling at the faith of a pagan he's marveling at the faith of a centurion a gentile who did not grow up in israel who did not sit at his mother's knee listening to the stories of the god of israel no this gentile grew up in rome around the roman gods in addition he's the commander of at least a hundred troops part of the army that has conquered israel has occupied israel is oppressing their people and taxing them he is not their friend now this one sounds like he's a good guy he's gained the trust and support of the local leaders he's built their synagogue so they like him but add to this that everyone involved knew that jesus would be crossing a line to go to the centurion's house because jews did not mix with people who were not jewish they didn't go to your house they didn't go to someone else's to eat with someone they wouldn't visit them jesus is crossing a line he did not have a problem crossing the line for how many of you did jesus cross the line come on now did jesus cross the line to come and get you did jesus cross the line into your mess and come and snatch you out i'm gonna talk to this side did jesus come for you did he cross any lines to gather you in how many lines did he have to cross to get to you did he have to cross over to your line of pride your line of unbelief did he have to cross over your line of addiction did he have to cross over your line of stubbornness did he have what line did he cross the line for you and he's always crossing the line for us he's still crossing that line but this centurion saw jesus crossing the line for him jesus was willing to go to his house and he had a revelation of who jesus is and how jesus's power and authority works that no one else had gotten yet and jesus calls this faith something's going on here friends all of israel in all of israel he has not seen faith like this how many of you want that kind of revelation like man no one else is getting this right now [Applause] can you imagine how peter felt about this the disciples you know standing around him his boys like hey come on what are we doing here we gave up everything to follow you we left our houses our businesses our families we're with you jesus but there's something going on there's something different about what this guy this centurion has figured out how many of you like to be told what to do anybody so when i was growing up you know how many of your moms told you don't do that but you went ahead and did it anyway right right for me and my brothers three brothers in the house a bunch of other boys in the neighborhood you know we did we made bows and arrows and shot each other so my mom's like boys you cannot shoot each other don't shoot your brother with the bow and arrow we're like why it's fun she's like don't do it we're like why because i said so and we're like oh okay mom yep got it you said so we're not going to do it anymore i'm on it no problem no that was not what we did that's not what anybody does when their mom tells them not to do something am i right we're like it's a free country if i'm going to make a bow and arrow and shoot my brother i'm going to do it now that i'm adult i'm grown i'm really doing my own thing i just got a brand new motorcycle big harley-davidson 107 milwaukee eight engine 1750 cc's that thing flies know how i know because if i want to drive 85 miles an hour on the highway i'm gonna am i right i'm not talking anybody else here am i no i don't think so cause y'all are good you're not like me how many of you know this is not how things work in the military anybody surf come on come on sound off thank you for your service this is not how things work in the military when somebody tells you to do something you're like roger that three bags full i'm moving out i'm doing it because obedience and authority obedience to authority is drilled into soldiers because it's life or death if you don't follow the order you could die your friends could die whether you like the order or not whether you want to do it or not most of us don't live in that kind of world it's difficult to understand if you haven't experienced it i mean most of us have people that will follow because we like them we'll listen we'll be obedient because we respect them some of us are only going to listen to the influencers am i right but how many of you would follow in life or death in the roman army that this centurion was a commander in they fought in what they call a phalanx they had big shields covered their whole bodies and they would lock shields at the front lock shields over the top and no one could get through this is how they won all their battles they were a fighting machine and they all had to move at one as one as one they all moved as one and who commanded them the centurion when the command when the centurion said step they all stepped when the centurion said step they all said step when the centurion said strike they all struck as one and that's what this centurion is talking about when he says to jesus i'm a man under authority and i have authority then when i tell my soldiers go they go when i tell them to come they come this is the kind of authority that jesus sees and he says that's faith so my first point jesus is obedient to the father this is why the centurion respects him because he sees that jesus is operating in the same kind of absolute obedience to god and this is the same obedience that we're being called to john 5 19 says so jesus said to them truly truly how many of you know when he says truly truly it's true right you listen i say to you the son of man can do nothing on his own accord but only what he sees the father doing whatever the father does the son does that's obedience that's faith hebrews 5 8 says that jesus learned obedience through what he suffered and being made perfect he became the source of our eternal salvation for all who obey him gee that's right thank you thank you jesus thank you jesus that you were the obedient one that you are the obedient one that you are the one who leads us into obedience because we can't be obedient am i right we don't have it in us to be perfectly obedient and so jesus is the obedient one for us jesus is obedient to the father because the father says so and he trusts the father why does jesus trust the father because he knows the father he knows the father's love and he has experienced the father's love and so he can trust him he can be obedient to him this is the kind of faith that's not based on abstract ideas this is not just a concept we're not just agreeing to a set of facts here folks it's like pastor marcus said last week your opinion doesn't matter whether you agree with jesus or not he is still the i am he is still the i am whether we agree or not god is still god whether we agree or not what we do what we think what we say does not change who he is it also doesn't change his love for us [Music] there's no other way jesus is the way the truth and the life he shows us how to be obedient to the father he is the only way to come to the father and when we put our trust in him when we experience his goodness when we see his mercy in our lives when we feel his grace he is worthy of it all am i the only one who feels that come on now well he's worthy of it all he is worthy of it all he's worthy of our trust he's worthy of our faith [Applause] and here's point number two because jesus has been obedient the father entrusts him with all of his power and authority nobody gives power and authority to somebody who's not trustworthy nobody gets power and authority if they're disobedient matthew 3 16 17 when jesus was baptized immediately he went up from the water behold the heavens opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove coming to rest on him and behold a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son with whom i am well pleased before jesus does anything in ministry the father says you're my son i'm pleased with you i'm pleased with you you wake up in the morning you get an a come on somebody that's exciting you don't have to do anything to please the father he's already so crazy in love and excited about your life you don't earn his love you don't prove his love he is so excited about you he loves you with an everlasting love whether you love him or not you wake up in the morning you get an a somebody look at somebody else and say when you wake up in the morning you get an a father's pleased with you he's happy with you that should make somebody excited [Applause] and this is what jesus experiences as he begins his ministry he knows the father has his back he knows he's pleased with him and then at the end of jesus ministry this is the word that jesus gives to his disciples all authority in heaven and arthur has been given to me so because jesus has been obedient the father gives him all of his power and authority because of that the centurion knows that jesus has the same kind of authority that a military officer has over sickness sickness has to obey jesus there is nothing more powerful than the love of god and jesus carries it all nothing can overcome god your sin cannot overcome god your sickness cannot overcome god your failure cannot overcome god he rushes in with his love there's nothing you can do to turn him away he's always going to stay facing towards you he's always going to come for you [Applause] and the centurion sees that look how he prays he says say the word just say the word just say the word and my servant will be healed what's going on in your life that you just need to say say the word jesus come on say the word over my finances say the word over my marriage say the word over my children say the word over my job say the word over my neighborhood come on say the word over baltimore come on say the word say the word say the word [Applause] i was a platoon leader i was an infantry platoon leader in the ranger battalion i was a man of authority i had authority i had 38 guys that followed me they knew i loved them i took care of them i cared for them and they trusted me so when i said come they came when i said guys we're doing this they said roger that we're with you so if i were to go to my company commander who's over a hundred and say hey captain you need to go over here and do this he'd say what who you think you are lieutenant whose authority am i using mine it's not enough it's not the right authority now if i was in the if i was in the battalion headquarters with my battalion commander the colonel over 700 and he said hey lieutenant you go and tell the captain that he needs to go over here and do this and i said to the captain hey captain the colonel says you need to go over here and do this what what's the captain going to do roger that move out smartly right whose authority am i using the colonels is it the right authority to use yes so whose authority are you using if you're on your own if you're just doing your own thing whose authority do you have yours is that enough this is why it's so important for us to be in community to be submitted one to another to give our lives to community because it's not enough for us to just be on our own it's not good for us to be on our own because when we submit to one another then we get the authority and power that comes from above am i just preaching to myself now see i know i know i know what's real i know people been hurt by other people that's real and i'm not downplaying that at all because when we get hurt by other people our truster gets broke it's hard for us to trust other people after we've been hurt but you know what in a community like this it's safe it's safe to submit yourselves one to another it's safe to come into one another's homes it's safe to be in a group to be in a growth group to say you know i've just been hurt and i need healing and because other people hurt you it takes other people to get you healed is anybody with me on this it's important for you to go to someone else that you can trust who's safe who can say i've just been broke i have a broken heart i've been disappointed by people i've been offended and hurt i have anger about that i have fear about that it's good to be honest about how you feel and come to a community and receive healing because jesus is here he's here to bring healing through your community that's the way it works through your community you get healed because jesus is with us y'all are the body of christ i didn't mean you individually i mean y'all when you all come together you're the body of christ and where is healing healing is in the body freedom is in the body salvation is in the body deliverance is in the body [Applause] you flourish when you're in the body when you're on your own you're cut off you're isolated you're going to get hurt you're going to get you can't grow this is the place to grow in the body anybody else with me on this and this is some good stuff i hope somebody's taking notes [Applause] all right let's go to verse to the third third point jesus is king he perfectly represents the father in the kingdom of god the first message jesus gives in the gospel of mark is the kingdom of god has come god's kingdom is breaking in on the earth on the earth as it is in heaven is that exciting to anybody because man things are messed up down here we need some heaven we need some heaven breaking into this place because people are broken things are broken systems are broken people are going hungry people are getting hurt people are alone that's not right we need some heaven to break into this place we need some heaven to break into this place jesus is the invisible image jesus is the is the image of the invisible god we used to say in youth ministry jesus is god with skin on you like that he came he came to be with us and he represents god when he comes he shows up and he's like god is posting up right here that's what he says i'm not holding back with you i'm telling you the truth when he shows up he says the kingdom of god is here it's me it's in me i'm bringing it to you i'm asking you to join the kingdom of god the movement of god on the earth through his people he that's what he's saying he's not holding back he says the king is now here come on somebody come on somebody the problem was that the disciples were looking for a different kind of king they had been enslaved they had been conquered by other nations they've been taken into exile they come back their nation is taken over three more times by other empires romans just the latest they do not know what it means to be free and they are looking for a king like david to come and conquer to come and destroy their enemies jesus shows up and he says i'm the king they're like all right it's on yeah let's suit up come on we're going right that's what the disciples think is going to happen jesus isn't doing that he's not fighting the enemy they want to fight he's not fighting the romans in fact he's asking him to join them jesus is fighting the enemy somebody say the enemy he's fighting satan he's fighting the enemy of your soul he's fighting the one that rages against humanity he's fighting the one that hates you he's fighting the one who's trying to take over from god the ultimate one who's dis the ultimately disobedient one and this is what the centurion sees he sees this he sees in jesus a powerful person who knows who he is who knows that he's free who knows the one who's representing because the centurion is that kind of person he's born free he was born powerful whenever he walks around he has the image of caesar on his chest and he represents all the power and authority of rome wherever he goes and he sees that jesus is doing the same thing wherever jesus goes he's free wherever jesus goes he's representing god he has god right there when he shows up the kingdom of god is present and they both know how to use power do you know who you are do you know that you're free or that you can't be free do you know the one you're representing do you know the king that you serve and the kingdom in which you're a citizen i got a bonus point for you so i know pastor marcus always does three three points i'm giving you a bonus point so maybe you'll have me back [Music] watch what happens to the 12. this is where it gets good when jesus had called the twelve together he gave them power and authority to drive out demons to cure diseases and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of god and heal the sick so what did they do they did it they went out they preached the goodness of the gospel of the kingdom they cast out demons they healed the sick they raised the dead come on was this before the cross were their sins had their sins been forgiven no this is before the cross it before or after jesus gave them the power of the holy spirit before how did they do this [Music] because jesus told them they could come on he gave them power and authority they he said it they believed it they did it he said it they believed it they did it come on say that he said it they believed it they did it you just flipped the page one more time later on in luke he sends out the 72 i love this because we don't even know who the 72 are right we know who the disciples are and we get pretty impressed with the disciples although they were all just ordinary guys right just like us we know they're messed up we know they're junk we don't even know who the 72 are and i bet there's women in the group come on ladies i'm just going to say it it's not gospel it's just the gospel of jay but i'm pretty sure there were some women in the team and they jesus sends them out ahead of him he's going to do a crusade and he sends them out to towns with he hasn't even been to yet and what does he do he gives them power and authority and he sends them out and what do they do they do it and they even say lord even the demons were subject to us by your name so had their sins been forgiven yet by the cross no had they received the power of the holy spirit nope had they been to seminary had they planted their own church yet how did they do any of that because jesus said it they believed it they did it come on somebody just look at your neighbor if he says it i'll believe it and i'll do it if he says it i'll believe it and i'll do it if he says it i will believe it and i will do it come on this should get somebody excited if he says it i'll believe it and i will do it that's all it takes that's all it takes this is how to live the life of jesus completely obedient to move in his power and his authority to preach the gospel to heal the sick cast out demons raise the dead if he says it i will believe it and i will do it [Music] [Applause] because jesus says all power and authority has been invested in me therefore you go you go you go you go you go you go you go and do what baptize the nations in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and teach them to obey everything that i've commanded you what did jesus command his disciples to do love one another feed the poor care for the stranger preach the good news heal the sick cast out demons raise the dead are we doing that you guys are doing it you're doing it every week you're feeding the poor every week you're clothing the naked every week you're going out on the street you're visiting those you're visiting those who have been in trouble who are living on the street you're giving them food you're giving them comfort you're giving them encouragement you're doing the stuff come on somebody come on say hey you're look at your neighbor and say you're doing the stuff you're doing the stuff [Music] if jesus is really king then what are we gonna do about it come on what are you gonna do what are you gonna do with your life if jesus is the king because he's given you all of his power he's given you all of his authority to make all the wrong things around you right [Music] i say let's take it to the enemy come on let's suit up let's get out there take it to the enemy he deserves to have his butt kicked all around he does not belong in baltimore he does not belong in your family he does not belong in your neighborhood he does not belong in your business he does not belong in your school he does not belong here so let's take it to him first john says that jesus came to defeat the works of the enemy so i say let's defeat his works let's come after hunger let's come after poverty let's come after addiction let's come after anger let's come after violence let's come after it come after it because we have what it takes he's given you his power and his authority to undo all of these works you are not weak you are not weak you are not powerless [Music] you have what it takes if you will say yes you have what it takes because if he says it you can believe it you can do it
