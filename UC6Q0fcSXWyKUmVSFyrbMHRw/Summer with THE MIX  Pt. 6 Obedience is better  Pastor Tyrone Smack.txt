[Music] amen amen amen luke 5 luke 5 chapter i'm going to start luke 5 chapter 1 of chapter 5 verse 1 so it was as the multitudes pressed about him to hear the word of god that he stood by the lake of jenesseret and saw two boats or vessels standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets verse three then he got into the boat into one of the boats which was simon's and asked him to pull out or pray him i don't know what version you read in or pray him to pull out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the multitudes from the book all right let's walk through some things real quick and so what you see in verse 1 is there's a press there's a press to hear the word they're pressing in to hear the word there is a moment that we need to get back to pressing in do you remember when we used to press to hit a word i mean now we live in a day and age where um where you can um eat from so many tables now you can eat i mean you can youtube all day sermons all day all day all week and so now you come into your own to your own dinner table stay with me you come to your own dinner table and now you need to be impressed because you've been eating everywhere else all week y'all hear what i'm saying so so they it was just a press to hear the word i just want whatever you pre who preaching deacon who i don't care i'm coming because i want to hear the word the praise and worship team preaching this week okay cool i just want to hear the word i don't care who's preaching isn't the word and so we have become enamored you remember back in the day you you know your mom be like look now we going in miss rebecca's house don't you ask for nothing y'all remember that you couldn't just ask for food like yeah i am a little hungry i will take a cheeseburger miss rebecca no you couldn't do that because it was very telling okay y'all don't hear what i'm saying and so what happens is there is a press in this moment where they are pressing in to hear the word of god and jesus god is standing by the lake of jenesser and he seized two vessels or boats and the fishermen had gone away and they were washing their nets they called it a day it was over ain't nothing out there to catch today i don't know if anybody here fishes um had an opportunity to go to africa before and um i went to africa and they were like yo we're going to go to a mountaintop and we're going to go fishing and i was like in my little american philadelphia yourself i was like bet i just need a reel though they was like if you get a real doe they gonna pull you in real doe they gonna pull you in because these fish is aggressive out here you need a net you you can't fish with a real you need a net and then it might be cool to to see it from this angle because we're in the mix and it's a mix of us in this room see when you drop a net you don't just catch one type of fish uh-oh i'm sorry when you drop a net you catch all the fish you get a boot you get everything when you drop a net everything get in there it's a mix of see i'll see where this is going it's a mix of things in the net and so they're watching and they say there's nothing out there today you know so jesus comes because he's a teacher he comes and he sees this moment and he says he gets into one of the boats which was simon's and asked him or pray him here's a little point for you a little nugget because i'm gonna work through this really quick here's a little point some of your writings say prayer he prayed him some of your says asked him prayer is asking but it's asking somebody to do what you know they can do yeah let me let me say let me say that again prayer is asking someone to do something you know already that they can do [Music] simon this is your boat you brought it here you can pull it out a little bit i already know that because i know it's your boat see how i figured that out so the question is why do we go into god's presence so timid why are we not going in he said come boldly why he said the only reason you would come boldly because you know me you come timid because you don't you assume me i gave you a whole letter about me you don't have to assume me i told you what i do and what i don't do remember that man that man that showed up he had a child that was sick he said my child is sick if you can jesus said if nah you need to talk to matthew if you're dealing with the ifs i'm a for sure thing i don't deal with ifs no wrong person sorry you got to go over there with the ifs he said i believe help my unbelief that's what he said he said that he said i i believe help my un i'm struggling with my i'm a believer i have unbelief jesus says uh he says uh he sits down and he says same and i need you to pull out a little from the land son simon uh when he had stood stopped rather verse four speaking he said to simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets we might catch something when we get out there for a catch he said let down your next for a catch we're going to go out here and we're going to catch some stuff because because what's what's happening right now simon is i'm showing you a lot of things because i'm a teacher and i'm showing you that one thing you need to know for certain is that you will never beat god at giving. you will never beat him at giving when he says he says is this your vessel can i use your vessel can you know do you know the the significance about a boat is it's called a vessel and and you and i are called vessels too i just need you to see that this whole this whole moment we're in this moment that he said can i use your vessel i remember when when we were on the youth choir we used to sing this song lord i'm available to you my story is empty we sung all those words we had no we had all the harmonies right we had a soprano alto antenna note right but we know what it calls to be available it costs to be available and all the master want to do is sit down on you and preach [Music] i told my daughter the other day i said you know god has been a sustainer my middle daughter i was talking to her in the car i said you know sometimes you just got to take that car trip just you and them you know yeah and so i said i said god is a sustainer you know what that means she said no i don't so you ever hear somebody say they're gonna hold it down for you till you get back on your feet do you realize that i said you know there's this there's this moment so you ever see those petals on the bottom of the piano she said yeah i know she said i said sometimes when you play a chord up top the the the musician can take his hands off and the note is still there the cord is still there i see you know how that is it's because there's a sustainer that's all he wants to do is sustain you god this don't look like a beautiful position you just want to put you you just want to sit down on you and put your foot on me that's it i'm just going to be the sustain you're going to sustain me i'm the sustain pedal at best what position do we think we have we're just the course gesture the king summons for us sing for me you know what the you know what happens with the course gesture when he doesn't obey the king off with his head no i i called him in here to dance for me he gonna pick his own selections what do you mean he picking this did he pray about the selections that i want to hear i'm sorry i'm sorry you're just picking your own select you just gonna offer me up some stuff i got my own playlist you need to check it seek ye first the kingdom of god seek me about what you want to sing for me [Applause] don't just get to dance for me you think too highly of yourself if you're at the knee of god go lower you need to be at his feet [Music] i'm sorry so um i don't know how all that just jumped out of there but launch out into the deed for a catch but simon answered and said to him master we have toiled all night all night we threw it all night and caught nothing isn't it funny that tutorial is a cursed word that's from genesis that's you with the fall of man that god said you're going to toil that's that's jesus said i came to fulfill the law i ain't come to abolish it i came to fulfill it so stop using cursed words in this blessed moment he said we're going out for master then you see us watching you i see you standing there jesus you was watching you was watching me watch my little ned court nothing nevertheless at your word i will let down the net that's your word i will let down and when he had done this they caught a great number of fish and the net was breaking do you do you see this i came here to tell you that i i i i meant to throw the title out but i just go off of whatever however the moment gives me right the the the the lesson today the title of this lesson is obedience is better it's it's just better we're going to contrast it i promise you i'm just getting through this moment right here because we're going to contrast it watch this he says he's left he says let down your neck for a catch and he said master we toiled all night we caught none basically was let me translate it to to um yeah he said jesus carpenter right covered it all right cool um stay in your lane um because i'm a fisher men right y'all know how we see uh that's what the bible says it says you honor me with your lips but your heart is far from can you imagine what praise and worship would sound like can you imagine what preaching would sound like can you imagine what teaching would sound like if there was a mic at my heart and my mouth at the same exact time can you imagine what that sermon would sound like if if i was singing how great is our god from my mouth but my heart was not he says we toiled mr carpenter all night and we caught nothing i'm a fisherman it's just not a great time to be fishing i'm not saying we won't ever catch fish again but just not right now but that's your word he lets down his nets and his net began to break because when the gross of heaven meets your little net when you're trying to hold on to the net when offering time comes god is saying don't don't just fill out that envelope don't just go to your cab whatever the uh you know opportunity don't just do what you want to do seek me first this ain't no prosperity this is this is the written word of god before you do it seek me about it there's stuff that i want i want you it ain't about the money it's about the trust where your heart is there is your treasure it's people that banged out they treasure on 95 in a car accident because that is their treasure their car they put all their stock in their car they put all their stock in their materials and when that stuff is good it was i was telling pm yesterday um yesterday i was telling i was telling him it was this moment where um my kid my daughter my youngest daughter my son we all had this like green jacket it was cold we was leaving philly and it was cold and um and we the first gas station we got to was a huawei right right by the airport in philadelphia we got we're about to go back to virginia and it was did i tell y'all it was cold not like this room cold but it was close like one degree lower than this right that kind of coat i said they ain't playing they don't want nothing near hell in this building goodness gracious my fingers was blue upstairs i was like i was going to put on this little t-shirt with the car like a polo shirt i said um i would have to give my aunt to knit me a quilt a shawl or something on joanne i would have to get something made but anyway and so i was telling him i said you know i got out the car and it was this young man standing there and a young man his nose is running and he says excuse me can i can i pump your gas for you i said i said nah look uh you know i'm using a car that's okay though okay hear me when i say this you have to have a wife father signal that's just something i made up okay you have to have a ear tilted toward heaven at all times i don't care you in walmart i don't care god once said somebody on the third eye on the cereal they're about to commit suicide and you need to be able to you just need to be able to hear what god is saying and then you need to inconvenience yourself [Music] you know how inconvenient it is to step through the portals of time to come down to a world the bible says even for god to look at earth he had to humble himself can you imagine the amount of humility it takes for him to come to earth for people that's casual with him for people to have operating legs but sit down the whole service i mean he good but he ain't good enough to be wrinkling up my pants you know i just got my hair done he ain't that good i mean he's good malphite melvin hart mike's he good but he ain't that good to get my hair all sweat i mean why i gotta get all in that it ain't gonna take all that unless you never read about calvary because if anything you should read that and say it didn't take all that but when you don't know your value you don't know how much you cost okay i'm sorry you don't know how much it costs to see your sin upon calvary you don't know so it took all that [Applause] took all that the young man said he said can i pump your guy i said man i'm i'm okay i'm gonna use a car and the holy spirit said the jacket you have on the one that matches your daughters and your sons is no longer yours it's his [Applause] i took the jacket off i said hey man i see you cold so i just want to bless bless you with this say can i pray with you and as the gas tank is being filled praying for this young man and then i went on social media not to brag and boast no that's that's just not that moment that's not i don't i feel like cameras just need to be away from those moments i think that's just a moment where god captures and all that kind of stuff but i went on camera for this reason and i sent everybody i knew to that young man i said here's his name and this is where his location is i just want whoever can to go down there and be a blessing and people started feeling bad yo i just went down there and i met him and they just went on it has to be bigger than us i can't be enamored with this stuff see god will give you stuff and then ask for it back i know i'm in the word all you got to do is ask abraham you'll see what he went through to get a son his wife was like well whatever you got to do you know what we're going to do we're going to help god out because god gave us a promising word so we're going to help him out because he's taking a little long we're going to help god out so we're going to get god off the hook because we told our friends what god had promised us and he didn't look like he coming through so what we're going to do is we're going to get the maid servant pregnant yup you boo-boo going to get her pregnant and they going to have our child okay and then we're going to walk around tell all our friends this is the promise of god and then god says get rid of that child and her because i keep my word i you you i listen i ain't everybody else i ain't none of your other friends in your call lord i teach my word so god gives him a child and then his child grows up and i bet they play football together and basketball and playstation negative five whatever one is out now they probably had it one way before that you had to do the homework on that one right there negative five because five is out right now anyway and so they had pla they was doing all that they was fellowshipping father the son and then one morning god wakes them up and say i want them back the thing you love i want it back and then god stops the moment when abraham puts his son on the altar his son builds the altar you got to stay you got to see how this is foreshadowing jesus i don't even know why i'm preaching this moment right here but he's foreshadowing jesus where his son builds the altar he says where where is the sacrifice dad he said oh god we'll provide and his son is building the altar isn't it ironic that jesus died on a cross a carpenter died on carbon tree and here it is he is building this altar and then he says you're the sacrifice and you never see it in the scripture where his son argues with him you know why because you got to live a certain way before god in front of your kids for them to believe when they say when i say listen god send you out of here you got to get up and they never argue back with you because you take god that seriously in front of them and and so with the angel of the lord y'all know how i go he stops him because there's only one son that's gonna die on the altar and that's jesus okay let me get out of this i'm i don't know y'all stop pulling y'all pulling on me and i'm staying in places longer i feel like then i need to be let me get out of this and so they he signaled they signaled to their partners in the other boats to come and help them and they came and filled both the boats so they began to sink this is what heaven's gross does this is what obedience does obedience don't just hook you up it hook everybody up everybody on your block get this blessing when you are obedient to god everybody in a cubicle in your office they get blessed just because you showed up just because you work here i'm blessed because of your obedience obedience it's just better okay let's look at jonah chapter one uh jonah chapter one oh i'm gonna start at verse two get up and go to the great city this is god talking to jonah get up and go to that great city of nineveh announce my judgment against it because i have seen how wicked its people are but jonah got up and went the opposite direction to get away from the lord i am out have you ever done that you don't have to shake your head please no you don't have to check your head has god ever told you to do something and you went the opposite way [Applause] let me put a quarter in the media real quick because sometimes god can tell you to do something and you don't even have to go the opposite way you just don't go the whole way and i just want to tell you that partial obedience is disobedience he said he said jonah got up and said you want me to go to the ninevites you want me to go you want me to go beat no no no i'm going the opposite way watch this but jonah got up and went went the opposite way the opposite direction and to get away from the lord we already we all in this room know you can't outrun him right he went down to the port of joppa watch this where he found a ship leaving for tarsus he brought a ticket because when you want to run from god it'll cost you sin will make you spend more than you're willing to pay and keep you longer than you're willing to stay trust me i know i got the t-shirt he brought a ticket and went on board hoping to escape from the lord by selling to tarshish verse 4 but the lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart fearing for their lives the desperate sellers shouted to their small g gods for help and now they're throwing their cargo overboard to lighten up the ship but all this time jonah all this time the man of god let me see let me see what jonah's doing but all this time jonah was sound asleep down in the hold so the captain went down after him how can you sleep like this that he shouted that's the only reason i'm shouting because the bible says he shouted sorry if i'm too loud for y'all they said he shouted so i did it how can you sleep like this get up and pray to your god maybe he will pay attention to us and spare do you see how disobedience has people who had nothing to do with your situation now just because you were on the same boat as them they in trouble the man of god he's on a run from god and he got the nerve that while his violent storm he got the nerve that while all this gun people gunning down places all over the united states he got the nerve y'all ain't hear what i'm saying you got the nerve man and woman of god while all this stuff is going on in the world you got the nerve to be sleek you sleep how are you asleep we out here praying to our gods and y'all got a god y'all sing about y'all god y'all say he's the powerful guy he's the majestic one the mighty one y'all say all that stuff about your god put y'all asleep and it's your fault oh y'all hear me i had to bring that out the bible said that i didn't say it it's your fault that we in this storm that we in and you sleep because of this i caught god has called you to do something you know you that's why i pray that the holy spirit meets you on each row personally you know what he's called you to do and as a result your community is at stake and you sleep i remember meeting a woman in africa and we was asking her did the government come and give her um housing as she was putting cardboard up because a storm had just come and knocked her cardboard and trash bag off the top which she calls a roof it just knocked it off and she was putting it back together and she said yes they have come and offered me uh housing she said but i i send them away why because this ground keeps me right where i need to be in god is your bed too comfortable is your bed your pillows that soft that you can't see that what's going on in our world is is a result of the disobedience and that we've caused this violent storm it ain't just show up god is in control did you realize that god walks up to a storm his his boys are like oh man we about to go down um oh jesus wake up you sleep get up jesus really quick get up home don't you care don't you see the water starting to get in the boat it's right around my feet jesus you sleep down there i want you to drown do you care jesus like i'm asleep in a storm you should be sleeping a storm but but let me teach you peace be still isn't it ironic that something with our ears has the ability to listen he said peace be still in this in a storm cease he's in control of every single storm then the crew casts lot now they're going they're going to gamble they're going damn they cast a lot to see which of them had had offended the gods and caused this terrible storm when they did this the lights identified jonah as the culprit as you why has this awful storm come down on us why we got enough when we got enough churches to clean all the communities in the world when we got enough don't we have enough carpenters in the church that we can build some stuff up why watch this this terrible storm when they did this the lots identified generally as the culprit why has this awful storm come down on us they demanded who are you what is your line of work what country are you from what is your nationality anyone know eric what oh what is your social security number like they want to know everything everything watch his response i am a hebrew i worship the lord the god of heaven y'all see that i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land the seller's were terrified when they heard this for he had already told them he was running away from the lord oh why did you do it these people's lives i'm gonna just keep reading because the bible says it they groan eleven and since the storm was getting worse all the time they asked him what should we do to stop this storm man of god what should we do he said this throw me into the sea jonah said that and it will become calm again i know that this is a terrible storm it's all my fault the man of god now the prophet the mouthpiece of god is now speaking and they ask what should we do what should we do with we in this situation i ain't these guys like i ain't never seen no storm like this ever in my life i've been up and down up and down up and down all around i ain't never seen this kind of storm what should we do he said pick me up and throw me off pick me up and pick me this is a foreshadowing of jesus moment i just need y'all to know that he said pick me up and throw me into the sea let me hop into this moment um you walked on here and paid the fare how about you just walk off of here and just dive into the water why i got to put my hands on you to help you you need me to help you you can't just jump you need me to throw no no no the bible says i'm just y'all can read it for yourself the bible says they rode harder to get him back to because you're the man of god we know you're god you're god's the big g well our guys are the little g we know your god we ain't playing around and they pray you can see it all in there and they said they don't want this blood on their hands they start praying to noah's god i mean jonah's god they start praying they say we don't want this blood on their hand and they start rowing harder to get him back the land and the bible says that the god of the storm made the storm more violence he meets the storm more violence and watch this and when they have no other choice they pick him up and they throw and the bible says the storm ceased and i don't even think that's the most beautiful part the most beautiful part is the bible says and they offered and made vows to jonah's god they repented we don't need our small g's no more we got the big one now this is a picture of romans 8 28 at work all things work together for good to them that love the lord they get off track at times they disobey if we can be honest at times but because all things not all good things all things work together for good to them that love the lord and are called according to his purpose the the big fish shows up as a grave and it holds jonah for three days you gotta see the foreshadowing of jesus if i be lifted up and you don't hear what i'm saying if i be lifted up that's a cross i'll draw all men unto me here it is these men who are now seeing this moment lifting jonah up throwing him into what is a big fish but really a grave he's in that grave for three days just like uh just like our savior just like our savior was in there for three days remember he was in that tomb he was in there and the bible says jesus was so in control in the tomb that they that he folded his clothes that's why people get mad at me for folding my clothes i fold my dirty clothes up in my hotel room you know i do it i do it you know why because jesus was in that grave and he folded his clothes he's in control and then and then god's god uses the fish to spit jonah back and you know the beautiful thing here god don't say he said he don't get in joe in the face and say what why'd you do this why'd you why why'd you do that jonah he don't do that you know what he does now where were we
