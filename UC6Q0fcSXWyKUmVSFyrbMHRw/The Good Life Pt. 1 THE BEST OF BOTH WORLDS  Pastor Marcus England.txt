[Music] John chapter 10. this is the scripture that we're coming from the passage today in John chapter 10. one of my favorite scriptures of all time it is the scripture in which God placed in my heart as we were building the mix and as God allowed for us to continue to see the work of this church move forward there was something that I believed I I said this to myself I said there is no possible way that I come into relationship with Jesus Christ and stay the way that I am I said there's absolutely no way you're telling me that our God our savior our Lord our King is coming into my life breaking up Darkness putting me into a place that I've never seen before he's opening up my sight he's restoring my life and I'm just supposed to live so so this is the scripture that I said if we're going to have a relationship with Jesus Christ we're going to have something that's greater than Sunday morning service we're going to have a true life a life that he's called the suit John 10 and 10 and it says this says the thief comes only can I can I can I can I make sure you underline that word only the thief comes only somebody say only I want to emphasize only to you why because the enemy is very good at making you believe there are moments where he is speaking truth to you with no underlying precept of trying to destroy your life I want to tell you time that God isn't speaking and you hear the voice of the enemy it it is not truth only comes the scripture lets us know to steal and kill and destroy what does that mean it means that anything that he is using in the world to distract you to get a hold of your mind to get you off focus to capture you out of your purpose it is only somebody say only to steal and kill and Destroy he has no other purpose stop giving credit to the enemy as if he's trying to help you out comes only somebody say only to steal and kill and destroy so stop giving him Passage into your life because he only comes y'all gonna pass it I'm sick of you saying it he comes only somebody say only to steal and kill and destroy I know you think the relationship was sent from God there ain't nobody like him they just as cute as everything you could imagine but if it's distracting you and getting you off focus it is the enemy and the enemy comes to do only one thing to steal and kill and destroy if it's taking you from God if it is succeeding in your life but destroying your spiritual walk if it's got you on focused and addicted if it's gotten you broken from God's commands and God's love and God's obedience it is from the enemy and the enemy does only one thing he comes to do what steal and kill and destroy I don't care if he convinced you to look at it one time I don't care if he convinced you that only one smoke only one look only one taste and only one touch is going to be enough to carry you over the only thing he wants to do is to do what still kill and destroy I need you to get it he's not on your side he's not making a pathway so you can succeed the Bible says the wages of sin is death you will lose yourself you will lose your mind you will lose your peace you will lose your purpose when you allow the enemy to get into your head your spirit and your body he only has one desire to steal and kill and destroy tell your neighbor real quick whatever it is Let It Go [Music] the reason why you're looking at me with that look is because you know exactly what it is that you need to let go Lord speaking it to you right there I can't I can't it's no it's I can't the only reason this is not even part of my message I don't even know how I got here can I tell you real quick don't confuse the goodness of the person the job or the success with the assignment of the enemy it may be a good person it may be a good job it may be a good successful move in your life but I want to tell you the end result and the focus of it is to steal and kill [Music] and destroy tell your neighbor real quick don't let it happen to you [Music] Pastor you finish reading the rest of the scripture just wanted to get that one sentence into you because if you don't recognize it you will make an excuse for the enemy that's trying to conquer your life today [Music] it says a thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy Jesus is speaking here he said I came [Music] I can't let me tell you why I'm here let me tell you why I've come to your life let me tell you why I've interrupted your entire life to get your attention let me tell you why I've shut some things down and shut some people down and shut some jobs down and shut some relationships down I had to get your attention I came I came because I knew you couldn't see clearly for your eyes may be blinded and your ears may be unable to hear but I want to let you know I came that you may have life and have it somebody say abundantly he came so that you could actually start living came so that what you see transpiring in your life right now would begin to make sense and you wouldn't just exist in every day doing the same thing hoping that it would get better he said no no no no with me in your life you can have life more abundantly [Music] the Greek word y'all know I don't usually do no Greek y'all but I had to give you this the Greek word for abundantly is paralysis and it means super abundant in quantity or soup or Superior in quality [Music] if I could tell somebody today you ain't living [Music] this thing living breathing you're doing just enough life isn't bad on the outside but it's not thriving on the inside you're dealing with your everyday and he said I did not come for you to exist I came that you might have life and have it more abundantly Superior and quality that your neighbor would look at you and say what are you so happy about why are you so excited when it doesn't look like life is perfect you can say because I chose to allow Christ to make my life greater and better of superior quality so that the cares of this life aren't the only thing I can see came to give us a better quality of life Pastor what's this series about it's about Christians and non-christians actually living the Abundant Life because I know too many Christians who are living life but not living life more abundantly [Music] I want to share with you it's time to live tell your neighbor it's time to live we're gonna come from this title today it's called The Best of Both Worlds best of write that down don't y'all play with me now this is write it down stop playing let's get into God's let's live abundantly let's stop coming and hearing information that's not doing anything [Music] let's live life more abundantly can we pray father in the name of Jesus we are tired of just making it we are ready to have life and have it more abundantly in you today here's father what we ask is that you open our hearts open our minds and open our ears to hear you for what you have to say in Jesus name we pray somebody say Amen Amen in Jesus name thank you so much musicians y'all can y'all help me give it up for our Dream Team in the house making it happen amen Jesus I'm gonna tell y'all something I really believe it is the will of God that all of us would be able to live the best life possible and according to the passage in John 10 and 10 it gives us the clarity of what Jesus came to do the first thing that Jesus came to do was to give us eternal life which is more important than anything else in this world came that we might have an eternal life but the second reason Jesus came was to give us life more abundantly life Superior in quality life that looks different and looks so different that people who don't know Jesus are looking at your life as goals the question is will people look at your life as goals for what you wear on your feet and what you will drive or will people look at your life as goals for the peace that you have that goes beyond the understanding of what even understands like why would you love and trust a god like this because there's something that's happened to my life that's greater than what I could ever do what I could ever build what I could ever buy and who I could ever be with my life is goals because you see the peace that goes beyond your understanding yes my life is goals cause it's crazy because I keep walking around with the smile on my face yet everything may not be perfect I still understand that God is in full control over my life to the point where you sit down and you know jealousy will rain around you see the reason why you may not experience jealousy from the world like Jesus did because Jesus made sure that his life looked different the Bible says that Jesus knew that if you would follow me and be my be my Bulls you would need to carry your can follow me some of us don't recognize that the carrying of the Cross is no longer the sense of being moderate or the sense of not being able to claim your relationship with God you know it your cross looks like today your cross looks like being able to walk in peace and to know who God is in your life today and yet not be able to fall apart because your life isn't necessarily where you want it to be some of the greatest parts of what I love about my life is that it looks different than everyone else's and it's something to look at as goals because the issue is while everyone else is living out their depression and living out their anxiety God has given me the ability to walk through it and to be able to survive in it so why I may still have it at moments in my life I've already claimed the authority over my life because I recognize I am more than a conqueror so every day doesn't capture a hold of my emotions and my mental stability because I've learned that I have a short foundation in Jesus Christ when I've learned that then I understand I'm living out the Best of Both Worlds how is that Pastor I've already secured my spot with Jesus when I leave this place and I understand I'm living life more abundantly it's not in what I have it's not in what I drive and it's not in what I wear it's understanding that if you snatch it all away I still have the joy of the Lord for it is my strength and it is the very thing that encourages me day by day that's why I understand where John is able to speak in John 16 33 and say in this life you will have trouble but take heart I've overcome the world it's when I get a diagnosis and it doesn't work in my favor but I still understand that I've already conquered it see there's two lives I'm living there's one life that I'm living that I understand if God doesn't fix it here he'll fix it on the other side and I recognize that why because I've secured my life through him but here's a little bit of the issue is that just because you've been saved it does not mean that you are already and automatically living the Abundant Life many of us come to Jesus but we don't release to Jesus our lives so that he can take full control and what we do is tend to live what saved yet broken I Found Jesus I don't know if he's found me and the idea that we get struck with is that because of an experience or a moment or an event that I am in this moment that God sees me but the Bible lets us know that Abundant Life is not through salvation only it lets us know that the true understanding of Abundant Living comes in our obedience somebody say obedience you may be saying how how can I get both worlds I need the Best of Both Worlds here's what I don't want to do I don't want to come to Jesus and find myself in position where the only thing I'm doing is waiting to get on the other side because that's the only thing that I have and excitement for God has called me not to just live in eternity on the other side with him while I shout and I'm ready to go when he says go I want to let you know he called me to live an abundant life right now I don't want to live a dry bone kind of life when I know Jesus I don't want to live and okay it looks kind of good maybe it'll get to where you wanted to get I want to walk in abundance I want to walk in health I want to walk in the fruitfulness of life I want to walk in the blessings that God has over my life I want to walk in to be able to bless somebody else not just receive a blessing I want you to look at me and have a Godly jealousy to say how do I get where you are and I can say to you it ain't by what job you got and it's not about where you work and it's not about who you know it's all about knowing that God is working to do greater than you could ever imagine or think can I get an amen in this place I recognize through the word of God that this Abundant Life living of the best Both Worlds is me understanding that God didn't just want to start when I got with him he wanted to start and make sure I knew that today the dry bones that are in my life shall live see some of us are Christians and dead some of us are saved and disconnected some of us have been convinced ourselves in our head in some kind of way that this is what Christ called from my life and the enemy in John 10 and 10. has convinced you that the way that you're living under the pressure that you're living constantly figuring out what life truly should look like settling disputes within yourself talking to yourself about yourself and answering yourself all in one conversation is all the advice you need while you don't even understand for yourself why you are where you are and I think we need to capture a hold of what God is trying to say is that I've called for you to have life here and life on the other side I don't want you just smiling in heaven and down here on Earth looking with the Grimace look possible to life you ever find people in a place where you just want to ask them what's wrong is everything okay you ever ask someone is something wrong and they and they look at you and they get an attitude because you ask them what's wrong and you want to take a picture of them and say hey this is why I asked you don't look the happiest now you have happy moments you capture them because you know how we do on Facebook we we capture happy moment yeah look at whoa look at me cut and as soon as the click goes off your face looks like it normally looks 99 of the time of your life looking stressed looking depressed looking like you're under anxiety looking like you don't have a friend in the world to call on looking like you are trying to figure out what in the world am I doing with my life but yet you want to personify something that God says I actually came so you don't have to fake the picture you can live it stop taking snapshots of what you want to be and start becoming who God has called for you to be I was talking to my team yesterday and I was telling them how my wife and I we were on date night and they said we didn't get any pictures I said no because I was actually enjoying myself and I forgot to take some pictures to show you that I was enjoying myself so that you could know I was enjoying myself so you could believe that I was living life more abundantly so I could prove to you through a photo that I captured at the right moment at the right second so that you could believe life was good when I actually saw it in my life that it is good and I don't have to prove it [Music] [Applause] did you have a good time I had a great time why you didn't post it I didn't want to I actually want to enjoy it I will post because they tell me what to do but I will but some of us are only living captured moments and we have been living the most miserable sad complaining broken lives and we get here on Sunday like Lord I give you my heart I give you my I see why you waited down because you have to recreate something that you haven't had all week long and you got to come into a place and put on an act for something that's not actually your life so now church becomes like social media where you gotta actually now come and be a person when you get to church that you're not every other day of the week because you're living out of a broken mentality and not Abundant Living so when you get here you're struggling to give God a praise because the truth of the matter is is you don't actually have the Grateful heart because you haven't lived abundantly see it's easy to do what you are it's hard to conjure up what you should do let's Worship the Lord again how many times they gonna do this when you're a worshiper you all already up I don't know how I made it this week I don't know what happened all I know is that you kept me you watched sober oh wait that's not the part of the service we in well I'm just gonna stay right here until we get to that part I honor you and I thank you you've been my God you have watched over me every portion and every area of my life and I thank you I don't need no music I don't need no worship leader I don't need nobody to come and fake it for me I know you are the living and true God I give you the honor and the praise that is due I don't have to fake it it's who I am I don't have to spiritualize my life I did it yesterday I woke up this morning in devotion and in my word where were you at Pastor mind your business you always want to know what I'm doing the reason why you can't convince your people to come to church it's because they don't see the Abundant Living that you have in your life so why do you are they like what I want to come in here and sit for something that's not even impacting you every time you get to work on Monday you sad depressed you look the same way life don't look like it's working for you at all and you're trying to convince me to come to church with you and you don't even look like you want to go girl come to church with me no I'm good I'm all right that's okay because the idea is I'm living something that I don't even know what I'm doing and some of us have lost such connection with God in such connection with who he's called for us to be that we show up to moments with God out of responsibility with no expectation that anything is going to change and so we get here when's he getting up up there's the thing it came on he's coming out we supposed to stand up in this moment right hallelujah thank you Jesus he said talk to your neighbor hey neighbor all right he got 40 minutes let's go and you are clocking in your transformation and clocking out and so Pastor how how do I live the life that's more abundantly good question Proverbs chapter 3 verse one through two says this my son and daughters do not forget my teaching teaching is my precepts and my principles but keep my commands in your heart for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity what does that mean it means in order to experience the Abundant Life that God has for you it is going to require you to follow Jesus and allow his word to enter into your heart and guide you according to his word and the principles and teachings of the Bible not your preference not your opinion not your thoughts not the way in which you seem as right unto you not your emotions not your mood today not with your depression your anxiety not what your schizophrenia I'm trying to talk about everything we got around it is not according to it I follow his precepts and his principles his teachings are my way and I keep the Commandments not on the outside but in my somebody say my heart yeah it's a part of me it's in me it's who I am it's in my heart why didn't you do that I didn't do it because I I wanted to can we be honest with your transformation looks like I wanted to can we have some honest church people here I wanted to it was right there they gave me an extra ten dollars I mean somebody was talking about that they gave me an extra ten dollars at the counter God said it was a blessing no he did not you know get that lady her ten dollars back give them that money back you're saying because his teachings are in my heart I'm not constantly walking around trying to figure out what I can and cannot do because I don't see his principles as a group of laws that are trying to keep me from living I actually see his Commandments as that in which restores my heart and keeps me in alignment with his will so that I can live what a prosperous life there are three things that this scripture says that God is offering us long life peace and prosperity anybody want all three of those man I'd be like Amen in Jesus I need all three Pastor you talking about do I want I need all three anybody want long life anybody want some peace oh Jesus and can anybody use some prosperity see your church I can tell all y'all church let me tell you why it came to prosperity and you got real religious no yes maybe no I don't know does Jesus say that's okay because all the spiritual things sounded right right it's like long life yes yes Prosperity I mean everybody didn't say something so I'm a I'ma keep it to myself you so tired now because you want prosperity does anybody want the blessings of the Lord okay I had to use blessings I got it Church terms Church terms I'll use that anyone I want the blessings of the Lord amen amen pastor I say Prosperity oh no got it all right let me help you real quick so we can get over this part long life equals health when he says I want to offer you long life I I want to offer you health in your body when he says peace I want to give you peace in a place in your life through the relationships every relationship that you have and prosperity I want to impact your finances I want to impact your career I want to impact the material things you have in your life God is saying I want to do something guided in your life so that you can see change why is this important this is important because all three of these intertwine with each other anybody know when your health ain't good you not doing good it affects your relationships it affects your finances you call out of work I can't come in today I don't know what I got and I don't feel like it and you immediately take off everything is intertwined and one affects the other you don't do well when your relationships aren't doing well can make all the money in the world but when life does not work around you with the other people you will be successful and lonely that's why going after the bag without having relationships always leads you successful but unfulfilled I got the bag all right what you gonna spend it on I don't know I don't have anybody relationships are important but anybody know you can have good health and good relationships but when your money is funny even for the most spiritual of y'all things get a little Shifty don't they you holy but you're Snappy how you doing fine okay wait hold on wait a minute what's going on nothing I love Jesus it doesn't really seem like it it intertwines the because there's a place in your life that in order to live on this Earth you need finances and when your finances are jacked up you're jacked up so you need God's blessing over your health you need God's blessing over your relationships and you need God's blessing over your finances your career where you are going Let the Church Say Amen when those aren't working together with God you find that your life does not feel fulfilled nor does it feel abundant and you live out of maybe one or two that are going well but you complain about the one and which is not going good and it becomes the constant conversation so while I have life more abundantly I'm living believing that God is going to give me eternity with him God says I want to resurrect your life on Earth I want to resurrect your life here so that you have something to be able to smile about because what you're saying is God is not just the god of my soul he's the god of my life of my health of my relationship he's the god of somebody say everything God over every area of my life I cannot be saved and broke and say everything is well because I find myself in a place where I'm stressing about the things of life that I cannot control God I need you over every component he's the god over your entire life not a piece of it stop putting God in the categories you want him to be in and leaving him out and now you're trying to figure out well why can't I get peace I'm here every Sunday I give my tithes I don't know what's happening because he's not the god over your relationships and because there's disobedience it's killing your Abundant Living God needs to have dominion over all of your life [Applause] not just a piece not just a moment you can't go do you in your relationships but give tithes and then and then like like uh you know I'm feeling pretty good and God's like no no I need that area of your life the whole area the whole area I need all of it I need to see what's happening in here so that I can help you so here's what this looks like long life is your physical domain peace is your spiritual marital and parental domain and the prosperity is your vocational and financial domain leave that up there one second guys you need God in every area of your life stop taking jobs and not Consulting the Lord stop getting hooked up in relationships and not Consulting the Lord the Bible says in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your path if your path is crooked you have not given God one of these areas straight up what area does not God have in your life some of us are spiritually accurate and financially deficient you loving God with everything and broke as a joke you know I pass it because money is not everything no it is not everything but it is something God needs every area of your life so what does it look like to live out of the best of both worlds The Best of Both Worlds means number one I must be transformed transformation is ongoing it is not a one step it is not an area of your life that you give over in one moment and everything changes you need consistent transformation I constantly need God to come in and see my heart see my mind and understand where I am so I can be transformed I need the baptism of salvation I need the baptism of water and I need the baptism of the Holy Spirit you cannot do two out of three you cannot do one out of three you need three out of three if you have not been baptized then you need to take the next step and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or in the name of the father Son and Holy Spirit whichever one you want you need baptism from baptism you need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit there needs to be an evidence that God is operating supernaturally in your life because too much of you Rises up every time you can't transform with you guiding you you can transform with the Holy Spirit guiding your life can't avoid it not giving you one part of the Gospel not telling you get saved and you're going to conquer all you will not you will not have Abundant Living because you will guide you you need the baptism of the Holy Spirit come on worship night we got a little time with you we got no room to take you in but we got some space to allow God to operate in that time second Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 18 says this and we all with unveiled face continually sing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord our progressively somebody said progressively being transformed into his image from one degree of Glory to even more Glory which comes from the Lord who is the what the spirit your transformation does not equal Sunday attendance your transformation does not even connect with you reading the Bible your transformation is not even empowered in only prayer your transformation is Through The Obedience of the Holy Spirit trust you too much that's why you can't say no you know Pastor I won't hear all that are you saved have you been baptized and are you filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit that is your transformation let me lock that into your head so well because you cannot transform yourself and you will get into a church environment that feels good you liked the way that it was the people seem nice this is what they did this is how it felt this is where it was it felt good it was sweet when you have the Holy Spirit you can walk into somewhere where folk ain't nice where it ain't all together and where things ain't perfect and you walk right in there and got me like sit your tail down and let's make it happen you'll be like I gotta sit right here why because the holy spirit is leading my life not my desire my mood not the way I like the service not the way I like to worship not if they sing the song I want to hear this week you will park yourself wherever the Holy Spirit says because you are LED through his Spirit not your feelings nor your emotions that's why you have so many people going from place to place because they have no Direction because the holy spirit is not active in their life so they got themselves off of what they feel and I'm here today to let you know you will stay wandering in your Wilderness until you are Guided by the Holy Spirit yes I'm talking to you [Applause] I'll leave this church you and 90 others have done it amen there's no way I want you to be in a church where you're staying the same way you are and not experiencing the full life that God has called for you to experience you must be transformed number two you must be delivered somebody say delivered yep because you got some stuff just like me and there is a Deliverance that is constantly happening in your life that whatever it is that you think you have broken free is lurking around the corner to capture your mind to capture you all over again Genesis lets us know that we were supposed to have dominion over the Earth yet we're finding out we are in a world where Dominion is running over us Pastor how do you know this because we are addicted to drugs we are addicted to plant-based things we're addicted to the ways of this world we are captured we are full of things that are not ours and we're struggling and we need Deliverance Deliverance is needed so that we can find Freedom to live out the purpose that God has for our life scripture says this in James chapter 5 verse 16. therefore confess your sins to one another Pastor why would you pick the scripture because most of us love confessing our sins to Jesus we love telling God what we do but we don't like telling other people where healing comes from we have forgiveness and we don't have healing wait what you mean just what I said you're asking for constant forgiveness but you're not getting healing from what you need forgiveness from because the Bible does not say go to God and there is your healing it says which is really good confess your sins to one another your false steps your offenses and pray for one another that you may be what healed and what that's why this Spirit of isolation and being an introvert is so prevalent so it keeps you bound up where you are because you don't know how to talk to other people and get free till you can confess your sin so you keep putting introvert up high and understand and keep saying I don't talk to people this is not what I do that's exactly why you can't be healed and restored so you're saved but you keep walking and you're saying Brokenness your healing is in confession it says the heartfelt and persistent prayer of a righteous man a Believer can accomplish much when put into action and made affected by God it is dynamic and can have what tremendous power what is that saying stop going to your unsaved friends to get Deliverance when they don't have Deliverance themselves I said it and I said it clearly I don't know if y'all coming back next week I'll see that's why you're not delivered that's why you're in the same place you are because you keep going to people who have no power and you're confessing not to receive change you're confessing to get it off your shoulders can I go a little bit deeper some of you have Christian ungodly friends [Music] you find the person that go to church once a month and be like you go to church okay cool let me tell you real quick you you ungodly together y'all need together to find somebody who believes it's not just talking about a Christian it's talking about people who believe do you believe in sin do you believe God's word says something to what you're do you believe the wages of sin is death it says go to people who believe not people who attend because people who believe will call accountability to your life [Applause] some of y'all got the most Church attending ungodly friends who you can't confess nothing to because no transformation gonna happen and you like it that way I'm in my mess you and your mess we just gonna be a mess together and the people that God has placed from your life you went back into isolation and said I don't know I don't need to be doing all that and they're like where you going you slip no I mean I don't I ain't going nowhere you know you going somewhere you know how you look when you get into the corner and start talking about it cause I'm about to you hey how you doing you need Deliverance some of y'all got some actions y'all doing together and because you're doing it together you are giving each other the okay light it's against God's word it's wrong you gonna do it yeah I'm gonna do it here's why that's so broken let me let me tell you why it's so broken because you can't be transformed for what you don't acknowledge you can't be delivered from what you want to acknowledge is your issue and some of the greatest people in their mess is actually Christians who have given themselves permission to operate and do on a Sunday what they would never do on the rest of the week because they know their life doesn't match so your Christianity is positional it's not internal oh I might have been quiet I love y'all I love you oh y'all I love y'all man but you're coming frustrated every Sunday like why am I still in the same place and I'm giving you that transformation can only take place will you make yourself available to other people so that you can be able to say to other believers here's what's going on on the inside of me I need Deliverance [Applause] not keep excusing it my team they love me but they they deal with me because I tell them real quick all you you have no merit for doing that you're wrong and we just staring at one another like you you're just gonna say that yeah you're wrong just that you're wrong what do you want me to you want to go to the scripture ain't that right Mia and then what we do that's what we straight up you don't talk to me if you don't want to know Jesus not if you don't if you want my teams don't come to pm You're Gonna Give You truth but if you want to stay in it and feel comfortable enough to work around it you go to the other people I'm like let's get you delivered but stop working in it and figuring out how to Stew in it but yet still operate see that's what we've been really good at I would stay in it and learn how to operate in it now it becomes normal I normalize my sin and now it doesn't feel like conviction anymore and I say where I'm at and I hide it and I try to marry it oops Point number three and then two months later come back like it's not working we knew God wasn't in it at the beginning real quick get my pastor off the stage he is tripping today we must have purpose-filled living keep it down over here okay all right I'm trying to preach the gospel and these people they don't want to hear Deliverance so let's not let's not spark that up purpose still living number three difference chapter 2 verse 10 says this for we are his that's the key point you actually want to get before you even get any further is that we are his the Bible lets us know we've been brought with the price if you've been brought if you walk through salvation if you walk the water baptism if you've been in filled with the Holy Spirit you've been brought with the price so for we are his workmanship his own Masterwork a work of art created in not you not your thoughts not your opinions created in Christ Jesus reborn from above sleep transform renewed ready to be used for good works which God prepared for us beforehand not when you got it all together not when you got it all right not when you put all the pieces together beforehand taking paths which he set stop fighting the pathway is to get you to the destination so that we would walk in them living the good life which he pre-arranged you messing it up putting your hands in it the path was set for you and it still is just gotta get your hands out of it the Bible says it was pre-arranged and made ready for us God's called you to have purpose-filled living not career-filled living purpose purpose-filled living looks like a life where you're not sure if God is even on your side sometimes purposeful living looks like when people walk away and they disconnect because God is doing something unique inside of you and different that it doesn't seem like it's right because good to you means things going your way but good to God means he's transforming you good looks different to God you're good and God's good are two different Goods good is not about what it does on the inside good is about what it is on the inside well he said man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at what the heart now you live in purpose-filled not complaining Phil your life is not stored up in what's going wrong it's stored up in what God is doing right it's not all about where things aren't going it's all about where things are going too and while you may be in a moment you can say this shall not last it will not say this way it will not be this way for always I may be crying but weeping endured only for night but joy comes in the morning I've already learned I'm can conquer in the midst of it all I've already learned that God has already pre-arranged it and set it up for me if I could just wait on the Lord and be of good courage he would strengthen my heart if I could understand that in my transformation that God is bringing Deliverance I can't even get to my purpose until I can get delivered because everything that is keeping me from walking in my Deliverance keeps me from reaching the place that God has for me to be so I've got to be transformed I got to be delivered and I've got to walk in my purpose as I'm walking in my purpose my life is so good that I forget how broken my past is you got scripture for that I sure do Ecclesiastes chapter five it says this even so I have noticed one thing this is Solomon the wisest man on Earth and he says this I notice one thing at least that is good it is good for people to eat and drink and enjoy their work Under the Sun during the short life I want to tell you you don't have forever the short life God has given them and to accept their lot in life and it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it to enjoy your work and accept your lot in life this is indeed a gift from God last part that I want to open your eyes to which shocked my life it says God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to Broad over the past [Music] [Applause] my life is so good now my life has changed and transformed I am so delivered now that what happened to me has not declared who I am so I have a praise now because I understand I'm living somebody say the good life it has been so good that it has taken over my past and I'm living the best life that I have today my past may have been a wreck but my today is everything God says it is I have a good life [Music] thank you foreign keeps trying to remind you of what happened but you got to be good enough to remind him of what's coming it says they're so busy God not just busy not just you got a lot on your calendar on your it says God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take not that they don't have but they make the decision not to take time to broad over the past this is a life of forgiveness this is a life of Peace this is a life of Freedom this is a life where road rage comes down about 20 percent this is a life where you're not living out of your attitude [Applause] [Music] this is a life well your past shall not declare your future I want you to have the best life possible that you will say to yourself I can't even remember all that the enemy is trying to remind me of I might not have grown up with parents but the life I'm living now God has filled the empty voids the life I'm living now is restored in him and today that's what we want for you we want you to have the good life the best life possible
