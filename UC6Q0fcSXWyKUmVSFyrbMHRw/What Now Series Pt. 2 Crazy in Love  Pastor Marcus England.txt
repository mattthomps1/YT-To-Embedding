[Music] we are in part two of week two of our series what now um when life looks different y'all and i don't know if you know this but life has just been looking different over these last couple of years life has changed life is looking a little bit more the sometimes crazier sometimes even more blessing but if i can tell you we are all adjusting to where life is now and we're talking today is even you can see in the theme of what uh our worship was uh just singing about is we are talking about somebody say love love so many people use your name in vain i wrote that you know i don't know if you know that but um uh music came to me and i i had a word and so i gave no no no i'm just kidding with you but oftentimes that's what we hear we hear that there are songs about love there are uh poems about love there is there is so much on the topic of love and what we think we know about what love truly is and i want to just explain it and bring a little bit more clarity to what god is saying to us and to you about what love truly is and here's what i believe in our understanding of what love is we can love better we can love greater we can see the impact of the love that god has for us and so uh i i want to talk about that and the title the subject that i want to come from in our week two is crazy in love no i did not steal that from beyonce the lord gave it to me um and so uh we're going to talk about crazy in love today what it is to be crazy in love and i just want to pray that god's word would just open our hearts father i pray in this moment right now that your word would truly open in us that we would not just be hearers today but doers of that very word in which you're connecting us to father i pray that our hearts would just be open and and and available that you can do whatever you want to do change us move us heal us speak to us for we want to know what you're saying we love you honor and thank you in jesus name somebody say amen amen amen amen thank you so much anthony can we give a big shout out to those that are apart that came in the snow like you did to prepare early our dream team y'all can we celebrate them real big around this place i still love our dream team i want to talk about this topic of love because love is really important to talk about because it's always the subject of being defined it's always the subject of uh getting clarity love is always uh a topic that is being looked at that is being filtered it is something that we're always trying to get a handle on but love can be very complicated can i be honest with you today love can be complicated uh not just a romantic love but the love within family anybody know that you can sometimes be in a family and you love them to death but don't like them you know what i'm saying anybody ever been there you love something but you i don't like it all the time i don't know if you if you're there in those moments but love can be complicated whether you're by yourself and you're unmarried and you're trying to find love and you're trying to find someone to be in unity with or you are in friendships and it can get tricky to love or the love you have and your family can be tricky or just even the love of a parent to a child and a child to a parent love has so many layers and the one thing that i want to talk about today is what love truly is according to god's word because i think it's the best place and the best definition for us to be able to establish what this thing of love is and when we're trying to find it we're trying to get it we're trying to understand it it can get complicated and i think it can get a little crazy charles and i think if we can really just kind of grasp in it what is god saying about love well one thing we understand is that the scripture lets us know in first john 4 8 it says that here's what god john is speaking says anyone who does not love does not know god anyone who does not love does not know god and it says this because god is love god is love that's important you get this god is love why because we're going to base everything off of what god says is love the reason we got to do that and let me tell you the reason we got to do that because we all have this definition of what love is and if i could really start to be honest with you y'all know what love y'all y'all we think we know what love is i'm gonna try to talk about that today love is that feeling y'all know that we get if we're gonna talk about a love in a relationship kind of context love is that feeling that thing we want to have when i see you and you see me when you lock eyes with that person and they lock eyes with you something like butterflies as old as you are or as young as you are just begins to multiply and we have now defined that that's what love is love is this feeling love is this thing the way you make me feel and and we start to question love when the feeling doesn't match up with what we believe love is anybody ever been there before you and you hear this you don't love me like you used to well what does that really mean it means that the definition of what i have said love is to myself is about a feeling that i want to last over and over and over continuously with no dips only highs and the problem with feelings is feelings are chemical and because they are chemical feelings can change oh man shucks feelings can change then if we're saying feelings can change then what we're saying is it's acceptable to say that love can change and when we say love can change it means that love can change according to how we feel anybody can admit don't raise your hand but anybody commit can admit within yourself that you and your emotions are just a tad bit crazy i mean just be honest you don't look up because i see you see me as i see you in this moment but i just your love can be a little crazy and when you start to love you know how you love you love emotionally you crying you're loving you angry you're loving you're yelling at somebody talking about you loving your loving comes in all kinds of what emotions i'm screaming at you what because i love you i'm crying cause what i love you i walked out and slammed the door because of how much i love you if we looked at loving that definition love looks crazy and love looks a little bit off and according to you love can change love can only change if love is an option which means that love has to be greater than a feeling love is a [Music] choice we say things like i don't feel the same way i feel about you before what it means is you're not meeting the condition that you used to meet that brought a feeling that no longer the feeling exists the way i want it to feel so now i've attached the feeling with the strength of love but i forgot to understand that love is a choice not a what feeling let's talk about what that looks like we are thinking about love we're thinking about what it is to be loved and so many of us are saying what i need to come from another individual is an emotional construct that stays at a high level to make me feel joyous and happy and to make me feel accepted and to make me feel good about where i am the problem with that is is that when we have not loved ourselves enough we are dependent upon someone else's love to complete us the problem with that is is that mean that you have not been working on what we talked about last week which is your singleness and your singleness as defined as being separate whole and unique is a part that you're supposed to work on for you so that you are not dependent upon someone else's level of chemical balance to be the place where you land daily so that you feel good about you if you had taken the moment and the time and the opportunity to not go find love and to allow love to be a part of who you are then you would understand love is complete in you what through god because what god is love if god completes me and god shows me who love is then that love i can do within myself and i can love who i am which takes me to the scripture that once i start loving me i can start loving others the problem that we're running into is that we're trying to find love and we can't find love we need to have love before we go searching for what we think an irrational or an incomplete understanding of what love is what are you trying to find you're trying to find oftentimes someone to insert their space into what the areas of your incompleteness or the areas of where you feel inhibited and accurate or broken and what we're looking for is not love we're looking for somebody who can read our minds know our thoughts understand what we do why we thought it what we said because we say things like you would know that if you love me first of all i'm not so don't you base love on the information of what i should know about you you should base love on the commitment of what i have spoken of what i would do and who i would be in your life it's the consistency it's not the emotional roller coaster you're not gonna like me today but i'm all right cause i love me the context that i want you to get is that when you have found yourself to be separate whole and unique you begin to love you which means what you have done in you you have the ability to share with someone else not find for the need of completion of what someone can give to you in order to complete you there is no one that has the ability to complete you but god and god wants you whole before you connect with someone else because if they are not whole you will find yourself depleting who you are in order to try to complete someone else which you were never called to do let me help you real quick so that you understand love was not coming from another individual to complete who you are you are called to do that on your own that is your personal responsibility that is your personal command that you've come into a place of understanding that you're called to love you yeah can i tell somebody stop tasking people with what you're not willing to do for yourself i need you to love me like no one else has loved me like not even jesus like what do you want me to do i don't have that it was in me you haven't noticed you're trying to pick yourself up in the day and because you have someone who is so dependent they don't know how to help you help themself so you're picking yourself up in the day and you're saying well why are you why you wake up like that why did i wake up like what why are you so quiet you mad no i'm not mad i'm just trying to get my thoughts together well if you love me wait wait have i wait hold on i'm responsible for your love at this early in the morning that's some early morning upkeep y'all that's why we have unrealistic ideas about what we think marriage can complete because we believe that these certain actions are going to bring about the love that completes us when the problem is it doesn't matter how perfect an individual tries to be for you the emptiness that is inside of you that is longing can only be filled by god and was supposed to be filled before you got connected with someone else who was unfilled so now it's like pastor i don't feel it anymore well great because i didn't marry your feelings i married you because of your choice love is a [Music] choice here's the problem most of us know how to feel love we just don't know how to operate in love because we haven't walked through what true love is can i define to you what true love is and just give you a moment and clarity to understand where we are the first thing that i want to give you clarity is through god's word in mark chapter 12 verse 30 through 31 jesus begins to tell us all right this is how you're going to love this is really really important he says and you shall love the lord god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength that's everything you got that's the first place to start in your wholeness loving god he says the second is this you shall love your neighbor as your self you can only give out what you are getting in the reason why you have conflict with so many people is because of the struggle of love within you oh we want to say that we ain't trying to do that today pastor we're not trying to do that i love me do you do you really love you so much that it pours out to love others or is the criticism that you give out so much a reflection of the insecurity and the lack of love that you have within your self if you complain or talk about people a lot there's probably an insecure place on the inside of you that has not been filled by the love of god so you need to find incompleteness in other people in order to feel good about who you are and where you're going if you love you you just be looking around like yeah man i just love on you you're great hey what else do i have to find except for whatever it is that's lying that's a hole in me because i project pain the way that it's inside of me if you feel insecure guess what your insecurity is gonna come out in this kind of lashing way that says you know what i'm i'm sick of this anybody ever found themselves at a place where you just like you know what if you love me then i would feel this way and somebody is trying to tell you i don't know how to make you feel the way you need to feel to feel loved if i did i would try but i can't because it's not my responsibility so we're called to love god love our neighbor who else are we called to love well john 13 34 says a new commandment somebody say commandment means this it's not an option a new commandment i give you that you love one another just as i have loved you you also are to love one another so we gotta love god we gotta love our neighbor we gotta love one another some of y'all like i man listen that's a lot of people to try to love uh pastor that's why you need the power of god's holy spirit which transforms your life so that you can love properly the love that you're trying to do of yourself you don't have the strength to do it that's why god gave you his holy spirit so his holy spirit for christians can transform who you are and what you can do supernaturally john 15 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you john 15 17 these things i command you so that you will love one another you think he's at something you think he's trying to get to something you think that he's trying to push a point about love love one another it's the most important thing not your career not who you say you're going to be he says i'm calling you to what love one another mark chapter 5 verse 43 46 says this you have heard that it will say you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemies anybody does that sound right that sounds right love your neighbor right hate your enemy love those at what do good hate those that do what bad great but i say to you here you go saying something jesus changing everything up giving me the definition of what love truly is he says but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good and he sends rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same jesus is summoning it up real quick loving other people who love you isn't that hard it's loving the people who don't love you that takes the spirit of the living god it takes god to love people who aren't that fond of you it takes god to love people who put comments in your comment section that make you about to be going off like i swear if they put something else in my comment section i promise you i'm going off and god says love them you're like no i'm good god says it's a command you say no it's an option he says that's where we're having a problem because what i told you to do was to love me with all your heart all your soul all your mind and all your strength not to opt in or opt out so when we understand scripture we understand that love is a force generated by a what decision which means that love doesn't have a feeling love is a decision it is a choice can i give to you four kinds of love just real quick so you understand because you may fall in different categories some of you are married some of you are unmarried you just may be like well where is this love the first love i want to give you in the four types of love is eros love and eros love is the love between a husband and a wife that is a healthy sexual love that you all have from each other this is where it is defined out of the english word which comes with erotic out of this era's love you will find this passion but let us not get twisted in our understanding that eros love is not the definition of what you're going to feel every time that love is a part of your life because sometimes there's a moment where you aren't feeling it and you have to go beyond feeling it let me talk real quick to the married couples married couples just want to say something to you real quick once you make that decision to get married you opt out of that decision to say my body is minds and your body is yours and you can do what you want the bible says you don't even have that right anymore josh if she looked at you and said come here then you can i've been working all day it's not your body come here oh my god jesus saved me [Music] here's what i want to let you know if you're not married and you're unmarried you don't have that ability because that is separate and it's saved for people who are making the decision between two married individuals because that's the way that god says it is to be not your option of how you feel because if you understood love then you will understand it's not about eros we'll get to which love it is but next is what this filial love this love that is is connected it is man i i got you anybody know that person that you know god saved you but every so often when you want to release that person out of you you there's a filial love for that person that's about to call you and you hope they don't call you but if they call you you'll lay down everything to you know to pick up whatever you need to pick up i'm not going to tell you what to pick up but you pick up whatever you need to pick up because you're ready to fight for them y'all know y'all got them people like i got you it don't matter what happened i got you and it's that person that'll take you out of what you know you're supposed to there is a feeling and a connection love that we have that's where we get the idea of philadelphia which is what the city of brotherly love where does that come out of it is this connecting point that i got you you got me and philio love can go deep i've got a story i don't want judgment though before i tell it all right i just want to put that out there so i love god let me start there that's the preface regardless of what you think after so i was at our my home and um our bass player josh he was helping we were doing some work when i say we that means i was there josh was doing the work so i don't want it to get twisted that in this story i was doing something i really wasn't um but i say we were working on the house together so that you can understand i was a part of the process so we were working on the house josh has his saw his electrical saw which is outside and he's got a battery on it and he is it's pretty big yellow it's pretty large and it's all metal and it's heavy and he's outside cutting some pieces and he's coming back in the house and coming back and forth and so he goes in and and and and we've got a pretty decent neighborhood and and i wouldn't think somebody would would try to lift a whole saw y'all a whole saw metal and all and try to slip away with it but josh opens the door he turns around and he says pastor somebody stole the saw i was on the phone with another pastor friend and i discontinued my pastorship for a brief moment and i said hey listen i'ma call you back there's an attest to this i get my shoes on i get my coat and i do like the boys in the hood run so it was much quicker than what you think pastor he said it's gone i said i'm gonna call you right back clicked up put my shoes on put my coat on and then i did the boys which was like yo oh we about to catch somebody i did that run i don't know if you've seen boy but it's that run it's like we bout to catch somebody i dart around the corner i don't even know what happened to josh i don't know what he did i went around the corner started looking in some places i'm looking at you let me tell you what happens when you got some real connected blood because i started looking at kids i started looking at children i saw one say our boys they had skateboards i said i promise if they got him i'm taking all three of them i'm losing my mind i'm running around the corner josh comes down the street i say you say anything he said no i go further down the street but i still got the boys in the hood run so i'm running like this like i swear and when i catch them they're going down i'm looking around trying to figure it out and then i see up the street josh is coming back with the saw at this point it was no longer about the saw the saw was done josh got it back my question to him was who did it i don't care john's like we got the song i said it don't matter who did it he said well it was the guy up there i did one of these he said i think he's gone i said oh my goodness anybody ever start running down all the things that you were ready to do and then jesus shows you i don't think you know me as much as you think you do and that's what happened i started running i promise you and we're sitting there and we're talking about like man i'm prom if you why don't you i'm i'm now yelling at josh well why won't you hold him right there and call me and wait for him to come josh is questioning my pastoring he's questioning his membership you know there's some things on the line right there but this filial love got me a little bit off because i care that much and there's another law of car story love it's the love between like a parent and a child it's just and it's an automated love that is there but then there's the real love which is the agape love of jesus christ john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever would believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life it is a sacrificial kind of love it's a love that says i understand it's not going to be 50 50. it probably will be a hundred zero but guess what i'm willing to love that way so much that i'm placing myself that the way god you love me is the way you've called for me to love others he says such as i have loved you this is what i'm calling you to do love one another once he sets all of this up here's what i want to get you too is all of this is to tell you this is how you're supposed to love he says once you get you're supposed to love god your neighbor your enemy one another and how are you supposed to love with all of your heart with everything you've got you're supposed to give it all that you got you stop loving conditionally you stop loving according to how you feel and you start saying if god called me to love my enemy then the people around me that he's called for me to love he's expressing that i've got to love them with everything somebody say everything i got to give it all i have but the problem is we like loving partially we like loving in what pieces you love me i love you this this valentine's day i'm gonna let you know some of y'all are expecting what you haven't given i'm expecting some flowers what are you sending me [Music] i want to stand up for brothers today yeah yeah stand up for the brothers the brother's like i mean you won't get abused in here but i don't know what's going to happen once you leave so you better think about your hand clap before you get too wild with it yeah she looking at you like okay okay that's cool he won't be home with you when you get there but i want to stand up because can i can i share something with you real quick as brothers we we we need love too and while you want us to spend on the bouquet of flowers and the chocolate and and the card that you won't read because you're trying to figure out if it got money in it i don't know where that spirit came from i bind that right now in jesus that's how y'all pick it up y'all pick up that car oh this is this is nice um anything else anything else coming delivery any anything else you got coming in the way i want to stand up for you and say where is our flowers i like chocolate you see me eminems [Music] tavon i'm trying to tell you because the context is all of us deserve it but if i can be honest about it we don't oftentimes like committing to giving it man we every man i just want to receive some love and i'm trying to tell you on the other side someone else is saying to you i want to receive love heard some of the married folk amen amen so whatever you need to do get online and get my flowers tell her your favorite color too and i would prefer if we're being specific can i tell you love is a choice and in that choice point number one love love love is a choice and we're just gonna just pull down this one point because love is a choice there's there's a context i want you to understand in order to really learn how to live out that choice here's something you may know how to love but you may not know how to live out love you may have a perspective of the feeling i know how to what take it i know how to look for it i know how to figure out where it's at but the problem of it is is i haven't learned how to give it and one of the first things that you must learn when you're loving you have to learn obedience you got to learn obedience over feelings if you're going to love you've got to love out of what god says not out of what you feel because i am going to tell you there are going to be times where you will be challenged with your feelings of love versus your choice of love and if you haven't made a decision there means there's an option available for you to love and not to love can i tell you because we change anybody know you change anybody look like they did when they were 15. y'all like i change right when we change we have to recognize that love isn't supposed to change with it when i was you know when we were together you had all that flowing hair now you cut it and i you know i just i don't know if i like it like i used to all you gotta do is turn around like love is a choice so you chose me short hair ball head long hair lock hair whichever one i decide to put on today whatever it is [Music] you chose to love me because in your choosing things change if you can only love me when i'm swole and i'm ripped and i'm wearing small extra small shirts i know fellas y'all know how you do you've been in the gym one day you in there with a baby gap shirt on talking about man i was just at the gym today ah man how could you not love this i want to tell you about it the obedience of it because it's so important because when we haven't learned to love we've put stress on people who we're in love with to be something to meet our level of expectation because love is conditional can i tell you we we even have a broken society so much that we put the stress on men and women now that surgery has to be your only choice to receive back the love because love wasn't a choice love was conditional john 14 15 says this if you love me that's what jesus said you will keep my commandments pastor i love god loving god is not something that you have to prove to me loving god is something you prove in your obedience that's why i never try to fight with people about how much they hear from god know god see god here hey whatever it is i'm great because what i know the determination is in loving god is your obedience to god not how much you volunteer for him because some of us are trying to make ourselves feel good instead of actually living out our obedience to him well pastor i'm single i'm not sleeping with anybody i'm doing good i'm not talking about just your sexual disobedience i'm talking about god has called for you to do things god has called for you to be things god has called for you to forgive god has called for you to love and you said no i'm not doing it i don't want anything to do it and god says your disobedience doesn't align with how much you say you love me we've got to learn some might say obedience anybody ever noticed that if you have a child you start trying to define if you really love them the worst they get and some of you have been that child but you haven't been there you get a child you just feel like they'd be like how's the youngest let me tell you something about that young one you go into a story it's not even like i love it's just you go into a story what about that young one let me tell you something about that young one here every day i'm making a decision cause that one is crazy the context is is that you're saying i'm choosing over what i'm seeing and what i'm feeling that love is still the only option that's available in the situation even though i don't like the space of where it is to be in love and to love is to make two different decisions and when you're saying i'm going to be in love please help me understand how you fell out of it because it's not like something you trip on i fell out of oh how'd you fall out i tripped out it wasn't what it was it wasn't what i thought it would be then you need to know the difference between allowing yourself to get in love meaning into a romantic space with someone without understanding and defining that that love comes with responsibility and if i can say this to us today is that some of us are very irresponsible with our love we're so irresponsible that we give it and take it away according to the way we feel and what we want so now we have hurt people who are in our space because we chose to take our love back because we didn't like the way that it felt but what we did not make the decision is that love is not a feeling love is a what choice so we've got to learn obedience and then second thing is we got to learn forgiveness somebody say forgiveness whoa anybody struggle with forgiveness don't put your hand up do anybody struggle with forgiveness sometimes anybody knows what that feels like anybody ever gets so mad i mean so mad so mad like so mad that you find yourself in the place where you're just like i can't forgive it and i'm not even gonna be able to release it and the enemy's like great because i got a hold on you because here's what scripture says because the enemy knows scripture he says basically if you can't forgive then guess what your father in heaven won't forgive you he's like so good you'll live in unforgiveness and you'll live broken so long that you'll stay where you are and you'll never become who god's called for you to be and i don't want you to learn how to forgive a person i want you to learn the what forgiveness as a way of living not in action to do because some of us are choosing who to forgive and we're choosing who not to forgive and if we go back to scripture scripture says what you're to love what your enemies you got some people in your life that you've got to learn to love that are your enemies and the only reason they're your enemies now is because you all aren't in the same agreement with where you are but the problem is is you were you loved them before but now they're your enemies today and god is saying well how did you fall out of love and we get it messed up because we're thinking in love romantically and god is saying no i call for you to love the kind of love that i'm calling is the agape love because of the holy spirit that runs in you that gives you the ability to forgive well what is forgiveness ephesians 4 32 it says what be kind and helpful to one another oh tenderhearted tenderhearted compassionate understanding forgiving one another somebody say readily and freely just as god in christ also forgave you pastor you don't know what they did you don't know how much they get on my nerves you just said well if you love me then you're what keep my commandments so we've got to learn to forgive my question is are you more concerned about holding on to something so you can control it or you're more concerned about loving so that you can be free can i can i can i ask a married couple a couple period anybody know when you get an argument how messed up your day is the rest of the day anybody ever been there before you'll be trying to give it all you got and you just watch your day just sink anybody i've been there before it just it's like goes into the trash you coming all serious hey how you doing i'm great okay all right well what was that about because you're convincing yourself even though you know you aren't when all you had to do is what apologize why who why is apologizing so hard because what sits in the middle of an apology your pride i ain't prideful yeah yeah because what sits in the middle of it your pride right there so how do you in the midst of it let your pride go so that you can be where god has called for you to be you got to learn and forgive well if you learn to forgive then that means you are open free and available to god doing anything that he wants to do in your life so one of the biggest parts that i need you to get is in order for you to really love you've got to be able to do for what forgive forgive me you got to be able to apologize apologize means but you got to be able to let it go so who can let it go anybody have problems with letting it go don't don't raise your hand but anybody have problems with letting it go anybody like holding on to it what does holding on do for you it makes you you feel like you strong right i ain't saying nothing to her i don't care what she say y'all both at the cabinet trying to drink the same cup i know you go ahead wait what did we just fight over a saucer in a cup you getting in the bed snatching covers one way somebody snatching covers the other way you got devotion time praying loud father the enemy is on my neck wait what are you are you talking about me you're dropping god in it you're just trying to whatever it because here's oh here's the part in loving we're not supposed to try to win but so many times we're trying to win in the love relationships that we have because we think winning is the goal and the goal isn't winning the goal is loving and in order to get to love you've got to forgive but in order to give you've got to remove your pride and to remove your pride means that you've got to allow god to enter into your heart to show you you when you're in devotion time god is not interested in showing you everybody else he's interested in showing you you god revealed to me just won't let me let you know that even though satan attacks i won't let it even though i'm in the valley of the shadow of death i won't fear no evil because god is with me you're like what is going on here because the enemy is very good at planting the sea that love is a choice and he's saying in that choice you have the ability to opt out and god says the problem is is you don't have the ability to opt out it's what i command you to do can i take it totally out of relationships and put it into what we're dealing with in our country which is race can i tell you in the most racially charged climates of the world that god has called for us to love those who do not love us and if we're called to be the mixed church i i think what god is saying is is there something that i want to do in you that only i can do in you that's not about how you feel but it's about the choice that you make it says i'm calling you to love and this is the commandment that i give you love one another as i have loved you so you are to love one another and point number three you must learn to sacrifice i want to tell somebody today you're in a relationship and you're looking for 50 50. and i want to tell you that you're missing what love is can i tell you so many times 50 50 is out the door you're saying pastor well what what what what can i do when it's 50 50 or 75 25 or 100 zero how do i get back god says i'm not calling you to get back i'm not calling for you to recover your missing amount because that's what we do i'm missing a percentage so this valentine's day don't get to give and receive you give because it's who you are would i want to do this valentine's day i want to love well who god called me to love oh oh what about this what what about what about sending a gift to your enemy y'all was like oh no that's that's something different bro that we ain't doing that now i don't know what you know what gospel you preaching i was like i just i just read the scripture just said it right here he says i say to you love your enemies oh oh we going we we ended up real quick he's like love the people that don't love you back love the people that ignore you oh what if you came to church and they didn't speak and you decide to come next week because you weren't easily offended what if i could tell you love wasn't about always being offended and trying to find somebody to put blame on but god was calling you to love just to choose the love what if you were in a place where you could just love today like regardless of like coach did not speak to me when he came in today i looked at him and said hey george he kept going oh oh i got an attitude and when i see him later i'm not going to say nothing to him now i've opted out of the commandment of what god called me to do which is to what love it's no longer a choice you hear the way she talked to you i know but the problem is god commanded me to love god commanded you somebody said command he commanded why are you being so nice because he commanded because it's not an option i don't get to choose if i'm going to do that today god commanded me to love and when god commands me the love i understand what his command is to me today faster they treat you wrong it's not about what they do it's about who he says i am and because he says that i am one who is his son i'll love like he says love today i i want to put you in this place where you stopped choosing because here's what choosing is doing choosing is weighing you down because you have a level of expectation that no one is going to be able to meet because the way you love and you're expecting equal love to give in love and god says guess what i'll love you the way you need to be loved stop looking for it from other people when you stop looking for it from other people you just be in a place where you be like i'm good you'll walk down the street if you live in baltimore and you're from baltimore you'll understand baltimore culture if you really want to learn love walk down the streets of baltimore and speak to people i'm about to teach you why i'm going to teach you real quick those of you who do not come from baltimore i'm going to teach you real quick why this matters because they are going to say nothing back if you if you know you come hey what's going on oh you're not gonna say nothing it's like okay all right all right so we need to keep working on your love because your love is not what you receive back it's what you want to give out god so loved the world that before you even made a decision that he would be your god before you even made a decision that he would be a part of your life he died on the cross pre you deciding it's like i'm not waiting for you stop waiting for the return and start operating out of the giving well pastor you know he don't he don't take us out like he used to then you start taking it all out we got date night tonight oh we do [Music] we we got date night you taking me out yeah yeah i'm taking you out [Music] because oftentimes we are conditioning our love based on the response of others i just want to charge somebody today how about you love and stop waiting for it to come back because it will automatically come back when you give it you're saying well is it going to come back from this person i don't know but it will so start loving married couples whatever it is you want to see in your marriage you started stop waiting talking talking people because y'all i don't know if you talking or you talking so i'ma talk to the category of the talking talking people y'all are the serious people right now they're showing you who they are [Music] love them where they are now or let it go no because we gonna be jay and bay no no you're not no you're not you're gonna be who you are so if you're talking talking and they showing you who they are right now either take it or leave it if you're married you ain't got that option [Music] so whatever you want to see how about you become it for those of you that are talking you're in a dangerous place because if you haven't made the decision standard wise what you're looking for you'll opt for anything because of the emptiness of where you are because you're not separate whole and unique you need to make a decision i'm gonna be there i'm not gonna be there i'm a love i'm not gonna love this is what i'm gonna do but what i won't do is be dangerous in my loving [Music] if you're gonna love love if you're gonna be a part search and ask god to put in your but if you're not then leave it alone and for those of you that are unmarried love where you are and love you can i say this if the person is not in your life then maybe you have a little bit more work to do on you yeah you like i'm perfect i don't know what your problem is i know i'm saying you are to you so keep working on your singleness so you can be everything you need to be now for when someone comes in your life in the future but some of us we don't need nobody right now we need to get healthy where you are get healthy where you are talking talking people make a decision i'm saying it on the stage i ain't forcing you to get married but i'm not telling you to stay in a space where it tempts you to the point of where you can't make a decision where you're going next and marry people you so displeased be what you want to see i think we can love today i think we just got to learn how to love i think we got to make the decision and all that i get and get what understanding we got to figure out what is god saying for our life and as we figure that out we'll understand that love is kind of crazy but when you do it right you'll see the benefits and rewards like you could never imagine or think today god called us to love him to love our neighbor to love ourselves to love one another and even to love our enemies today god's love is just enough for you
