[Music] anybody thankful this morning anybody know the lord has woke you up this morning anybody know the lord has started you on your way this morning anybody know it's not because you deserved it but it's all because of his grace and mercy so we said we'll enter into his gates with thanksgiving and then it says from understanding what god has done i'll give him some praise so can we praise the lord the bible says let everything just tell your neighbor everything everything that have breath the bible says praise the lord king james says praise ye you the lord amen god bless you real quick as you take your seat just tell your neighbor real quick it's so good to see you so good to see you in this place [Music] as you can tell we are here for the presence of god and we are here for god to do something at the mix we understand in 2022 this is the year of expectation and so we have an expectancy every time we walk into the house of god that god wants to do something more than we could imagine or even think and so guess what we're imagining the greatest thing that god can do today so that he can exceed our expectation today so i'm trying to tell you if you can just think on something you need got to do right now the bible says he can go beyond somebody say beyond if god could go beyond what you're thinking right now you would praise him already in expectation that he's going to do it any how my god it's good to be here let me introduce myself my name is marcus england and i'm the lead pastor here of the mix and so we welcome you here those of you that are in person and those of you that are online i say a special welcome to you to the mix church i'm glad we're in the house anybody glad to be in the house this morning amen amen listen i'm excited to jump into the word of god i i'm i'm just believing that god wants to speak something in the house today but i i just really want to give a huge push today to let you know that growth track step one is happening today and if you've ever figured out how do i become a part of the mix how do i get connected how do i become a member connected here at the local church what i want to do is offer you this opportunity it is a session that i'm able to teach and to let you know here is what it looks like to get in the mix so after our experience you can connect with those that are at the orange table and they will give you direction on how to get in the mix and be a part of growth track step one today and i'm excited for you uh we were just going over some stats just earlier and just watching god multiply the ministry and watching god do things beyond what we could even imagine or thinking so we're so grateful for this opportunity today and also we're still jamming this july but we're still rolling with summer at the mix so you know you're gonna have some snowballs today you know how y'all were looking for it somebody said where would they last because don't worry about it we're going to have them again you know so let's get into an opportunity to love on one another to have community with one another and i'm looking forward just to being able to share those moments with you can we jump into the word of god everybody all right listen can you open your notepads real quick open your phones whatever you're going to take notes with here's what i believe that transformation takes place not because god just does it but because we are a participant in our own transformation one of the things that i see here is that leaders are what and readers are leaders so what we're doing is we're understanding that readers are leaders and note takers or what world changers as we're reading what god is speaking and saying to us we're taking notes so that the notes that we are writing down are a part of god being able to speak to us to speak to where we're going to speak to the next direction here's somewhere where i want to catch you at is some of the reason we have not moved is because we don't have anything to pull from in the moments where we feel stuck and we're trying to go off of our memory and i want to let you know today that god wants to speak something so specific to you today that he needs you to capture the moment that you're in because he wants to speak a blessing a revelation he wants to speak a word of freedom over your life today so get into the word of god i believe that god wants to speak today matthew chapter 22 matthew chapter 22 as you open your bibles if you don't have your bible it will be on the screen and we're going to start at verse 15 and we're going to go to verse 22. and this is what it says it says then the pharisees went and plotted how to entangle i want to let you know jada pinkett smith was not the first person to use that word bible already says they plotted how to entangle him meaning jesus in his words it says and they sent they didn't go themselves but they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians saying teacher we know that you are true and teach the way of god truthfully the bible lets us know that many will come and teach the word but they will not all be true prophets the bible says that jesus came to teach the truth because what he understood about the truth is that when knowing the truth that truth has the ability to be able to set us free and they said and you do not care about anyone's opinion for you are not swayed by appearances it says tell us then what you think and they begin to ask them a question they say is it lawful to pay taxes to caesar or not but jesus aware of their malice i want to let you know that everyone that is inquiring of you does not have good motives every person that's coming to you to ask questions is not always asking for the benefit of what they want to know from you but it is sometimes with an ulterior motive it says but jesus aware that malice said why put me to the test you hypocrites he says show me the coin for the tax and they brought him a denarius and jesus said to them whose likeness and inscription is this they said caesars [Music] then he said to them therefore render to caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are god's and the bible says when they heard it they marveled and they left him and went away i want to come from the topic and i want us to talk today from this message caught in the middle caught in the middle can we pray father in the name of jesus we're declaring today that as you speak to our hearts in this moment that there will be an enlightenment that only you can bring through the power of your word i pray that as this enlightenment happens it moves beyond our feelings it moves beyond our emotions it moves beyond the walls that the enemy puts in place for us not to receive the word but i pray that today we cannot just be only hearers of your word but doers as well in jesus name we say somebody say amen a men in this place thank you so much musicians i'm so grateful to our worship team that has led us in worship and i am so grateful to our dream team that's serving can y'all help me celebrate some amazing people in the house thank you so much i want to talk today from a very uh relative place of where we're dealing with in our world today i want to talk from the place of sometimes as being a follower and a christian where we can get caught in the middle a couple of weeks ago i i was planning a trip as i i was scheduled to go uh out of the country and i was planning as if i had everything together i had ticket paid for we were i was traveling with someone else and told them i could make the commitment and and and i was ready to go i was i was ready to go the only thing though that was a little bit jacked up in me being ready to go is that in order to get into another country you have to show proof of citizenship you have to be able to show that you are citizen of one country and the ability to be able to get into another country and so i i very very easily went and got my passport but the problem is is that when i looked at the dates on my passport there was an expiration date now unlike some of us who tell you oftentimes that the expiration date don't mean nothing when it comes to food this expiration date meant something and this expiration date said after this moment you don't have the ability to be able to travel outside of the country without going through a renewal process in order to get your passport well i felt good because i said well you know there's a passport place in in washington dc and there's a passport place in philadelphia and and there's probably if i have to travel i'll travel to new york and in my citizenship as an american because americans are so confident in and how we move and that we can just get anything done i called the u.s passport agency and i said yeah i would like to schedule an appointment because i travel out of town in a week i said sir here's what i would like to let you know is that you can schedule but we don't have anything available i said to them well you don't understand the urgency of what i need to do i need to get out within a week i travel in six days so i need you to get me on the books they said you may want to get on the books but there is no space for you to get in the books as i looked i said lord you know how we do immediately lord i said now if you want me to go because i put the pressure back on him we read the scripture a couple of weeks ago that says come to jesus i couldn't complain to nobody else but god because only he could open this and say lord if it is for me to go i'll go if it's not then i got it it's okay listen i i'll i just will have to tell them so we had a holiday on monday the next day was tuesday i called i said do you have any appointments they said sir we have one appointment and it's in detroit michigan i had to open google and find out where that was again i hadn't looked at the map in so long and when i said detroit michigan she said yes we have a 9 30. i said i don't know how i'm gonna make this work but listen i need you to book it as she was putting in my information she said i'm sorry that appointment is gone i said now ma'am you told me it was available god opened the door but you did not move fast enough the lord opened another door and so it allowed me to get in at 11 30 and she said do you want me to book it i said what do you think this this is where we at yeah yeah i need you to book it she booked it i got in so god has opened the door but now there is the process of going through where i've got to figure out how am i going to get to detroit michigan i look on southwest there's a flight open i have some points you know i have some some some vouchers available i go to the vouchers and i say cool i'm going to put this in it and i schedule and book my flight and i get there and i go through a process and i say it's gonna be a one-on-one interview let me tell you how naive i am to this process it's gonna be a small interview i'll get in and out i booked my flight all early to leave i walk in there's got to be about 200 people looking at me the man said get to the back of the line i said jesus i was able to get my passport and get everything on time and then that next week when i got in i traveled out of the country and the most important document that i could show was my passport of citizenship to the united states it gave me legitimacy it gave me an understanding that i was qualified and i had a status of where i belong it was in america and that i could cross over here's what i want to let you know is that proving your citizenship to where you are is important for you to be able to go further in your life today i'm i'm coming from the scripture in matthew and and the lord gave me the scripture and i wasn't even thinking why i don't even know if i've ever preached and spoke from this scripture but the lord spoke to me he said marcus there are a ton of issues that are happening in the world and what is happening is my followers are at a crossroad because there's a tension between what's happening in the world and what's happening in the spirit and as he was revealing the scripture to me i began to look at it and i said lord i get what you're saying and so i started looking that often times as followers of jesus christ we are caught in the middle we're caught in a place where we're trying to understand what it really means to follow jesus while also living out our life in this world the bible in matthew chapter 22 lets us know that the pharisees which are the religious leaders at this time it says they sent their disciples in a mission to be able to disprove jesus so that they could catch him doing something that would discredit who he is the bible tells us two things that i want to let you know the first thing is that the disciples came and then the second thing is that the herodians came now the herodians were a political group of individuals that sought the best interests of the government than they did the best interests of the people and in this government cohesion all they wanted to do was to disprove jesus because he was trying to put an understanding that he said i'm bringing forth a kingdom that is not of this world he said i'm i'm laying this foundation of what should have been working out of what i created from the beginning of time he says i'm letting you know that there's there's a kingdom that's not of this world that's not made by the hands of man and and and so they were trying to catch them i don't know if you ever had this before but there are people that in your walk with jesus they're trying to catch you slipping trying to catch you slipping and and and they like to use words like well i thought you went to church i i thought you was a follower of jesus when when i looked at your page it didn't really look like you were coinciding with where jesus is i'm just trying to figure out do you know him or don't you and the bible says they were trying to entangle him and they were trying to speak some malice against him and so you had the religious leaders who were at such a place in their life that they believed that the religion that they held superseded everything and then you had the herodians who believe that government superseded everything and it's a little bit while now we see there shouldn't be this this crossing of church and state but the problem is is this world was not created from man's government the world was created for the kingdom to dwell here on earth if you go back to genesis it lets you know that god formed man in his image he had a plan that man as he would have dominion over the earth that his dominion would allot him the ability to be able to govern in a what godly way and a kingdom influence but we got a little messed up with sin y'all and sin brought about the idea of self and vision if you hop over in genesis it lets you know that there was something called the tower of babel where the men tried to be able to create such a large building that they wanted to reach god today i want to let you know that your purpose is not the same as your self ambition i want to let you know today that what you're going after is not the same thing as what god has created you to do let's not get it twisted god did create you to be able just to do a job god created you to be able to fulfill a purpose in your life that's why the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and it says and all other things shall be added on to you we don't start with what we want to be we start with what we're created to be we don't start with a degree we don't start with a job we don't put our trust in who we're going to be and what we're going to do because there is nothing in this world that god created us for that we can be fired from your purpose cannot be controlled by man [Applause] i'm here to let you know today that god has created you for purpose but the problem that we oftentimes run into is in this moment you had such a destruction about to happen that the herodians were willing to connect with the pharisees even though they didn't like each other i'm here today to let you know you're trying to figure out why some of your enemies are together against you and i'm here today to let you know it's because they're plotting they're more interested in your demise than they are concerned about their togetherness anybody ever seen somebody come against you just before and and and when they started talking about you they they ain't like each other before but now you see them they're best friends ain't they because they have what a commonality and the commonality is we don't like you here's what i understand about hate hate can be so embedded in us that we're willing to share the stage with people that we don't agree just to make sure that in whom the enemy has used as a plant to destroy you they'll come together just to see your destruction i'm going to tell you something real quick there are some planted seeds that they don't even know but their whole project is to get you to a place where you're denying the purpose and the potential that god set on the inside of you there are things that are put together there are places that have been created that they don't care about their odds they just care about making sure that you don't make it and the idea that people are coming together against you to see your demise speaks to the level of purpose that god has over your life that's so incredible that the enemy had to put a team together in order to destroy what god's trying to y'all don't get this thing real quick the fact that the enemy has groups of people means there's something in the seed of your destiny that is greater than what you even understand and the enemy has to get a team against you in order to stop you because he understands that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and if i dare to believe it god can do immeasurably in my life [Applause] so what he does is he's so good at putting ordinary people around you without vision without direction who have settled in the place that they are to talk you to your demise so that you stay where you are and to live as comfortable as you want to thinking that that's the only potential that lies on the inside of you the problem is i want to let you know is that when you quiet the voices that are around you and you hear the promise that god has set over your life you begin to understand that even when things are at its worst god's promise is still yes and amen i could shout right there at that moment because whatever the enemy wanted to do he couldn't do whatever he tried to do it didn't work when i looked at where i came from and where god has me today i look back over my life and i think things over and i can truly say i am blessed anybody have a testimony in this place the devil tried it but he couldn't succeed the devil wanted but he didn't make it he tried to kill me but it was not okay with the lord the lord put a hedge around me and he said not so today somebody give the lord a praise in this place tell your neighbor real quick not so not so not so not so i will live out my purpose i will live out my destiny not so in the name of jesus [Applause] there is something about when you get to the place where you understand that no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper i don't care who you are i don't care where you're coming from i don't care how close you are i don't care if you're family i don't care if you're living in my house no weapon formed against me shall prosper because what i understand is that i will walk out the purpose that god has set over my life so i'm not afraid anymore i'm not scared when people walk away i'm not fearful when they desert you i'm not messing and racking up my mind trying to figure out how i'm gonna get you back here's what i know when you see the purpose fulfilled in my life you'll come running back [Applause] you got to be confident about who you are you gonna get that phone call you living your life out you hear that person call hey how you doing don't be calling me now but because of the grace of god you'll work through these moments because whatever god is doing in you is more than it being about for you he set a purpose in playing over your life for the impact of so many more but what he tries to do the enemy is to entangle our thoughts and bring malice to the work that god has called for us to do the reason it's taking so long is that oftentimes the enemy has planted seeds in the mouth of other people so that what they've been speaking to you even though they cannot stop you they've been speaking something so consistent that it now has set seed on the inside of your mind and because it sets seed in your mind it now bothers you when they're no longer near and what you're trying to uproot is other people's broken seeds that are not bringing forth good fruit but have become weeds that are entangling your purpose and your destiny and because they're trying to speak malice and to try to put you down they have what they think is the ability to destroy your purpose but you've got to understand that god has called for you to live out the best life possible now here's what i want to let you know is that as we are fulfilling god's purpose over our life we're going to have to fight with some tension somebody say tension here i gotta explain this today because it's so important because what we have created oftentimes is the idea that the believer can live out a life without conflict and my christianity is supposed to make me a punching bag because christians are nice and we don't get angry because we understand that james says the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god so what you produce out of your life is the wrong perspective of not being a confident christian but you're trying to be a good christian and there's nowhere in bible where god is asking you to be a good christian he's calling for you to be a follower in your mistakes in your mess-ups in your frustrations he said i'm calling for you to be a follower of me in order to make you a fisher of men and women it means you've got to walk through something and deal with the tensions that you live with within your christianity and in this world so the first point the only point i want to talk on today is point number one which is you have double citizenship somebody say citizenship all right here's where i want to explain to you is that your dual citizenship brings about a tension in your life where you're trying to figure out how do i live in this world with a kingdom perspective and the kingdom perspective comes when i receive jesus christ into my heart and i become a children a child of god we are now children of the living god so now it means we have a passport which gives us dual double citizenship what we have to learn as followers is understanding kingdom principles that allow for us to walk in this world with a godly mindset it's important to teach this because oftentimes we're either leaning to one or only to the other and the reason that we're fighting so greatly now is because we don't understand that we're living out a dual citizenship which brings about a tension that happens in our life that we're always trying to solve instead of walking through just couple weeks ago the supreme court gave the decision of roe versus wait and it brought one of the greatest tensions in our country and i'll never forget walking through the tension because i absolutely believe that god is the only one and only one who can speak to creation he is the only one and i want you to hear me very clearly as i am speaking this a creator is the only one who can give decision to creation now the context of clarity is that we live in the tension in the world where all creation does not come out of the place of love and secondly the dealing of control that comes from a government mindset is not always for the people it's intended for and so as we think about women as we think about the control as we think about someone giving and understanding over what you can and cannot do that automatically becomes a frustration and the frustration isn't always the tension i believe and i don't believe it's being caught in the middle to say why i understand there are some conflicts and areas that i wrestle with that don't seem to align with the yes or the no [Music] and we like clean you for it or you're against it the problem is is that when you're living in dual citizenship it's never that easy for the things that i believe don't always settle with the things in my heart and if i can be honest with you and tell you is that the way in which i understand god to say it doesn't always clarify what i know to be true sin has broken our concept and mind frame to be able to create laws that have the equality to be able to look at every person and consider the direction that they're in and so often times we're stuck between the government and what god says and we're trying to be like those who are of the pharisees and the herodians that you're trying to say no this is all the way or you're on the other side saying this is what god says and the problem with what this is what god says and it's only government is that there is a self ambition that's involved in the process of government that does not allow for equality that we all experience that's why you must understand and read god's word as you're studying to know that god said you ought to love the lord thy god with all thy heart all thy mind and all thy soul and you are to love thy neighbor as thyself anything that comes under that that does not work within that time frame lets me know it's out of the will of god so we deal with somebody say the tension you deal with the tension that i still want to follow jesus but i don't always agree with the concepts that are connected and i want to let you know today that the church is being bombarded so that malice is spoken against it it's so easy for everyone now to come together who never had agreement in the beginning because the idea is that if we can break this christian thing the enemy knows that he was already plotting see we only see just what cnn put up but the bible says that we're fighting against a spiritual thing the bible says we're not fighting flesh and blood but principalities and spiritual wickedness that is in what high places so what i must do is pray and seek god's face to understand spiritually what's happening in our nation so my mouth doesn't precede me in something that's not biblically accurate and what i don't do is just answer out of what i feel i understand i answer out of the tension because the tension is still there i want to tell you today there are some things that you will wrestle with until you see god and you've got to be okay with god i don't understand it but the inside of my heart as david said is lord search me and if you find anything that's not like you take that out when we're working with dual citizenship the idea is that you live in a world no the idea is that you live in a world that has to be dealt with with grace grace does not mean i drop standard grace does not mean i stop loving grace means i handle it under my dual citizenship that's why the bible lets us know we are to stop drinking milk and to start eating meat because those who drink milk don't have the maturity to have the conversation outside of the emotional space to include not only their worldly view but also their kingdom view and when you use your kingdom view you have the ability to understand through grace the natural means of what it impacts you and how it makes an impact in your life while you're still saying i understand what god says and whatever god says i agree and i'm in alignment with but i'm still working out this soul salvation so please excuse me if i don't have it as perfectly as you want me to have it and you feel offended because i'm not saying it the way you want me to say it what i'm doing is working out of the space that i'm truly in while also honoring god in the same space so the idea behind it is that i understand what god says and i understand the tension that comes with the situations that people who oftentimes create the law don't have any connection to that's why community is so important because in a law that's created to summarize everybody's thoughts ways and what it should be you need to be in community to work out what god is speaking on the inside of you so you have the ability to walk through the process and not leave the process to the idea of one statement i need people around me who have experienced abortion i need people around me who understands what god's word says so i don't rush to conclusions and become offended because i don't understand what god says they were trying to trap jesus because here's the idea that they had they basically said if we can trap jesus if we can get him to say guess what don't give it to caesar he said guess what what happened the romans would come and they would arrest them but if he said yeah give it the taxes over to caesar it says the people would have betrayed him and the enemy is always trying to sabotage your purpose and he's trying to use the trickery of bringing broken people together to create arguments that are posted in one-minute sessions that convert your whole biblical understanding and theology because you looked at one real and was like yup i agree with that that's right instead of having the filter of the bible that's what keeps us as christians from being more educated and how to handle our dual citizenship is through the understanding that we know what god's word says and we understand the world we're living in you have the old double citizenship you have this place where you're trying to figure out where you are who you are where you're going i'm gonna always let you know can i tell you real quick you're gonna always have dual citizenship problems for those of you that work out in the marketplace they will call it out at a company you're going to have what dual citizenship tension can we pray real quick no we don't pray in the workplace because this is not what we do and the enemy will always use the back and forth to frustrate one side to make one side celebrate and seem arrogant in their celebration and to give are out to say we don't care about what anyone else thinks or is doing we just need this to happen when they took prayer out of schools people rejoice that's right because my child should be subjected to it then we have mass murderings of children and we say get prayer back into school because we need god to cover we are such emotional beings that we don't understand that's why the word of god was established because we don't have the full foundation and the stability to be able to understand everything god set in order is for our good it's not for the moment it's for our good today and tomorrow the bible says he never changes the same god yesterday today and forevermore and so when he's created these places that we need to come to clarity and understanding he says i knew in 2022. what was going to happen i knew where it would go so there's always going to be dual citizenship dual citizenship when we get into our job imma let you know young people when you're in school you're going to deal with dual citizenship if you are a follower of jesus christ you're going to tussle between do i want to do that should i do that should i go there should i be a part of it how does it impact my what my relationship with jesus christ it's really easy to stand on the stage and tell you uh uh just let everything go and don't look at the people having fun and don't look at the party and don't look at the stuff that's happening and all of it is of the devil it's devil don't touch it and what happens can i be honest the temptations of this world look good you hear that oh man you in your dorm room nothing clubbing that thing thumping over there oh man yeah i'm just going to go over there and just pray for some people maybe now you start giving yourself excuses to get to places i'm gonna go over here and see who i can lay hands on and uh i'm gonna go over here some of y'all know y'all were in sunday school every sunday but when you got to college in high school you forgot who jesus was it was like spell them uh l m uh i'm sorry i i forgot listen i'm telling you because there is a temptation of this world that is strong and you will always be in the tensions and the wrong thing that we have told people is that when you become a part of jesus christ none of this stuff ever happens you don't get angry you don't get tempted you so powerful and everybody has to know i've got to renew my citizenship daily daily daily i got to go lord let me go back in here because i don't know where i'm from right now i'm acting apparel fool up in here and they about to make me lose my mind let me renew my passport because my citizenship is about to act up i'm just trying to tell you you got to carry that jesus passport with you everywhere you go lord stamp it stamp it lord stamp it [Applause] because it feel like this thing is about to expire that's if you being real charles that's if you're living in dual citizenship for the rest of us that you know find ourselves living in the heavenly gates and we're always with jesus never we ain't never without i'm always with jesus he never leaves me god bless your heart and all of your parts but i'm gonna let you know for those of us that are living in the world we are tempted for those of us that are in this place we are depressed sometimes for those of us that are in this place anxiety is kicking in for those of us that are in this place anger tends to take over for those of us that are in this place we slip and we mess up and that is why the cross is so important to us that's why he got up from the grave [Applause] he's covering all of our nests but if we could be a honest people we could be a transformed people but we're just sitting with attitudes in our hearts and emotional breakdowns and we're not taking our passport to jesus lord i need you to do my citizenship again cause i'm about to lay her out [Applause] [Music] and that's why living in the dual space can be so complicated because at times we're so used to our world citizenship that we haven't taken time to understand our kingdom citizenship and here's what i want to clarify for you is that sunday is not enough for you to understand your citizenship and your rights as a kingdom listen real quick the reason why some of us don't understand what to ask god for and how to understand the blessings that he has set over our life is because we don't understand the kingdom principles that bring about the kingdom movement so that we can reach after the things that the king has given us so we operate out of a church knowledge but not out of a spiritual movement and so we're in the world where the bible says we're not of the world which means that's why we have to learn as we love the lord god with all our heart all our soul all our mind and loving our neighbors as ourself we're seeking god to understand what is it that i do in these moments and these situations where the tension does not revolt resolve itself what do i do what do i do with the anger what do i do with the place that i'm going what do i do when i'm tempted what do i do when i was fully in god and i've messed up and i'm trying to get back to him but the enemy says you can't let me do this one real quick what do i do when money tempts me to go in a direction that can benefit me but not fulfill my purpose i need double citizenship understanding i need to understand that what god has called me to work he put the purpose in me before he gave me the job so i'm established to be whatever he calls me to be as a kingdom citizen what does that mean that means go play heaven 600 and blast it so everybody knows you're saved it means live out your christianity in a transparent and real way so you stop faking something you have not become yet you can't act out something you haven't become but you can absolutely speak to something you aren't yet there's a difference i can speak to it it doesn't mean i need to fake it because the context is is that in process god is working it out for my good so the question today is how do i live in the tension of what god says is not him versus the feelings that i have versus the things that are on the inside of me that seem strong versus the places that i am because the idea at the end of the day is that romans 12 1 says this i therefore brother and this is paul speaking he says i i ask that you present your bodies he knew we would want to do what we want to do but he said i'm just going to ask you present your bodies somebody says as a living he says a living sacrifice what does that mean that means most of the time you're gonna have to constantly die to your self so that you can fulfill god's plan pastor how do i do that ideally have to go before him see prayer is not a good routine if it doesn't have a purpose because outside of that i'm gonna tell you you're gonna struggle with prayer fat i thank you this morning i appreciate you hello oh yeah um where'd i leave off jesus where'd i leave off the reason the effectiveness of prayer isn't always a part of where we are and what we do is because we're very used to operating in this world's citizenship we know how to do that the idea is is that i need clarity and my kingdom citizenship so not that i'm fulfilling religion but that i'm fulfilling somebody say relationship relationship gives me the stability and understanding to know that i'm just not doing it because i'm in front of pastor i understand my citizenship and my responsibility to the king tell your neighbor real quick you have a responsibility to the king not to pastor not to the church am i looking at you no your responsibility is to the king you don't have to hide it from i have nowhere to sin you nowhere people scared i'm not going to do that in front of my pastor maybe you should put it out there i have a little bit of a problem [Applause] and i could use some help right now but what's happening is is that we're trying to be something in front of the space of people that we have not become and so prayer helps us to get to the level that i can live out my kingdom citizenship better than i live out my worldly citizenship today i believe god is calling for us to live with a kingdom a greater kingdom mindset so that we can see the purpose that he has over our life fulfilled and declared in what we do and who we are can we thank god for the word today hallelujah [Applause] i want to say this to you today that i truly believe that god has something in store for you and in this moment i i get it i'm i'm so clear on that oftentimes i'm living in the tension of my walk with god here's how you do it you begin to ask god lord is this your will for my life is this what you have for me to do instead of walking down the lane of is this just wrong and right i'ma do this today is that wrong i want to go here is that wrong i want to be a part of this is that wrong i want to engage in this is that wrong that's a very broken religious mindset the mindset is lord what do you say i'm all about your kingdom i want your kingdom to come and your will to be done on earth as it is in heaven here's the best way lord am i representing what you have already spoken in heaven not is it gonna a pastor you know ain't nothing wrong with that you know what jesus did that y'all don't have to go back and tell me what jesus did you got to tell yourself that as i've talked to god as i've wrestled with it as i've been in the place of going before him that's what he's laid on my heart but here's where i want to break that tension is that stop declaring what god and the bible says when you are not a reader of it and you're not a study of it because it's real easy to slide it in for your benefit today i'm calling you to the place of being true sons and daughters of the faith of jesus christ not to fulfill what we want you to fulfill and not to be who we want you to be and not to go where we want you to go but that you are seeking god so much that you know in your heart i know what god has said and whatever he has spoken over my life it is yes and amen
