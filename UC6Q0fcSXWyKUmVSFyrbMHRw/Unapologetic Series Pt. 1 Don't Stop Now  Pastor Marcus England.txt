[Music] welcome you those that are here in person those of you that are online we are just excited for all that god is doing i really want to get into this word of god of unapologetic why this series unapologetic because what i do believe and what i do feel is that we are apologizing for what god wants to do and when we apologize for god's presence god's move god's clarity and understanding of what he's saying we are matching that up against what the world is saying and we're trying to come at these complete spaces of and whom do i listen to and and whom do i uh operate and whom do i form myself to believe in which way do i operate and what i have learned is that when we are children of god and we do not understand who god says we are we don't understand the purpose of god's plan and we don't understand the purpose of god's move in our life we will consistently apologize for the work of transformation that god is doing in our lives we will either find ourselves apologizing or living in the space of offense and i want to let you know today is that what god is doing in you is not for you to be offended it's not for you to be broken about it is not for you to be apologetic about but who god has created you to be and who god is forming you to be i want to let you know today is that it's something unique and special about who you are and what god is doing in your life today this context that i want you to get is so that you can understand that there is a purpose and a plan that god has put over you in you through you and for you that you are supposed to operate out of but when you have compared your life to look like someone else's life and purpose you will apologize for not being in the normal standard of what everyone else does and because you're different you will apologize because you look different than what everyone else is doing i want to let you know today different is good different isn't bad different is a distinguishing mark that god has made you transformed you and using you to do some work that is beyond what you understand to do if i can explain some things to you today there are some things that are happening in your life and some things that you've gone through that have formed you into who you are the problem is is that you've always looked at it with the wrong perspective and you looked at it from a negative connotation the thing is that even the worst things that have happened in your life have created you to be a unique and purposeful individual and in the brokenness of what you believe is hurt the bible says god can transform anything that has taken place in your life and turn it for your good if you could understand this then you will walk in the clarity and understanding and knowing that even the broken areas of god of my life god has them working out for the purpose of my good it doesn't matter what i grew up without it doesn't matter what was in my past it all can work together for the good if i believe that god is using and working in my life today but what i must understand and must know is that i'm working through the purpose and the plan that god has set over my life and if i am operating out of the wrong plan i'll get the wrong results and the wrong results will lead to the wrong perspective and the wrong perspective will lead to the wrong attitude and where you'll find me is living someone else's purpose while i'm unfulfilled in minds i want to say this to you today why it's important you understand this is because the problem that we do is that we tend to live out of the opinion and the hype of other people and we set our lives and our directives around what everyone else believes and what everyone else thinks that's why we apologize so much for being who we are i'm sorry that i i do this i'm sorry that i talked this way i'm sorry that i'm just a little bit crazy like that i'm sorry that i tend to believe in faith that god can do the impossible and what i want us to do is stop apologizing for what god is doing and manifesting in our life and allow the promises of god to truly be yes and amen i think it is very important that you understand in clarity that what god is doing is not determined by someone else's mindset and someone else's perspective it's determined by what god has already said and decreed in his word for his word it's true the bible lets us know in john 1 1 that in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god what does that mean that the very words that god has spoken out of his mouth and establishing his word are already yes and amen i can depend on them i can trust them i can lean on them it can be the very foundation of how i live my life and where my purpose ends so i stop relying on people to define who i am and i live out of the image of who god says i am the bible lets us know in genesis that we are created in the image and likeness of god and if i'm created in the image and likeness of god then there's a dominion that i walk in and a purpose that he set over my life that nobody can end or destruct regardless of who they are because god has already set this thing up i want to let you know today that there is something about what god is doing in your life that is different than everybody else's plan i want to destroy the thought that you have today to believe that you need to be like somebody else and to look like somebody else and to operate like someone else and to believe like someone else what i want to let you know today is that you have been created with a unique identity the bible says that you are complex in your nature that you are fearfully and wonderfully made up and there's something about you that nobody understands there's something about you that when you talk things change there's something about you that god has placed the favor over your life stop trying to be and matter to the opinions of others and become who god has called for you to be you must be called to walk in the power in the demonstration you need to stop apologizing for being favored by god you need to stop apologizing for what god is doing in your life that looks like it's different than what god is doing every everybody else's life i'm here to let you know i am not sad about my blessings i'm here to let you know i am not sad about what god has declared over my life i'm here to let you know i'm not apologizing for what he's doing inside of me i want to let you know today i'm not apologizing because he's changing my name and he's changing my life and he's changing my children and he's changing my marriage and he's healing my body and he's restoring my mind i'm not apologizing because i've landed in favor with god i want to let you know today i've landed in favor with god because he already spoke it over my life it's nothing that i've done it's not who i am it's not about my last name but it is that die i am a heir with christ a joint heir with him i have an inheritance in him and there's something about the name of god when he speaks it it is yes and amen i'm unapologetic that god has chosen me i'm unapologetic that he's called me i'm unapologetic that the lord is deciding to use me but what i must understand is that when god uses me i have to know that when he's using me he's using me in the right way and the only way i know it's the right way is that i have spent time with god can i tell you today that you cannot build your relationship with god without spending time with god everybody knows that a relationship can only be built on time and the equity that has been put into it you cannot not deposit in your relationship with god and have an expectation to withdraw from the blessings of god everybody knows about this you've been in your bank account you can declare it speak it name it call it down from heaven but here's the context of what you've got to understand is that as you do that if you did not deposit you cannot withdraw that in which has not been deposited is that which cannot be withdrawn so what are we talking about today we're talking about that jesus is in this moment the bible lets us know he's just fed the five thousand he's taken two fish and five loaves of bread and multiplied that fish sub for over ten thousand people fish subs for everybody fish up for you fish up for you bible says he takes it he breaks it he offers things unto god he breaks it and as they go around where groups of 50 100 it says that the lord begins to multiply can i tell you today you don't need any more than what you have because god can take what you have and multiply it and take it to the extreme extent to use it for whatever his purpose and plan is i love the idea that god can take anything i've gotten just create you know it's so it's so good when you see people do stuff and you didn't even know they could it's it's amazing y'all ever been you just watched like i didn't even know you could do stuff like that so i get jesus like listen i just want to know what do you have because whatever you have i can take and whatever i take i can multiply because i'm a god of multiplication not addition the bible says he said be fruitful and do what multiple you got it you got it he didn't say be fruitful and add two he said be fruitful and multiply that thing so what i want to let you know is god is saying i want to multiply what's in your life i want to show you through my word that i can do great things with what you have but i'm establishing on the inside of you is a clarity to understand that jesus is saying what you must understand is that i've come with a purpose but in that purpose i must have direction the bible says he feeds the 5 000 y'all can i tell you they they they're losing their minds in there they got fish sandwiches they got a word from god ain't nothing like going to church and going to brunch y'all i'm just going to be honest it ain't nothing like getting a word from heaven and getting the word at the nice little deli to get something to eat i'm here to let you know the combination goes together really well because most of y'all have to church like where we eat now where we where you wanna go with brunch at where you wanna go where you wanna go real quick uh where you want to go eat cause listen we got reservations real quick so i'm just trying to see what the time frame looked like i'm trying to tell you that things were getting they were getting rowdy y'all things were getting good things were things were things were blossoming jesus is ministering he looks at the the people and say they look like sheep without a shepherd he goes and he begins to speak to the bible says he speaks to him all day so much so that the disciples say to him listen jesus you got to send these people home because they are about to pass out y'all think i'm long talk to jesus he was teaching for a whole day and he didn't feed anybody we gave y'all waters when y'all came in come on now we're a little better than jesus church right now the bible lets us know that after he does this the bible says he he sends the disciples away forcibly to go and it says that he sends the crowd away and when he sends the crowd away it said jesus goes up to the mountain to pray why when things are going so well do you need to take a break because when things are happening so well and god is blessing you the way that you've never seen before you need to take a moment to make sure you are in alignment with what god is doing so one of the first points i need you to do is in an unapologetic way of living you need to get alone you need to get by yourself you need to get into a space where you can hear the voice of god the bible lets us know that jesus sent away his disciples he sent away the crowd he went up to the mountain and the bible says he prayed cannot can i can i tell y'all when when you're getting a little above yourself you need to get humbled let me tell you where the best humbling comes in the presence of god him back she's just humbling you because you said man look look what we just did we just fed 5 000 we we just killed that you see what we you see man how many did you give out you only did 150 man i was killing it i was passing out handing out sandwiches letters and tomatoes adding cheese i was doing all that you don't know where i was and we start thinking the bible says more highly of ourselves than we should and we we start taking credit for the miracles that god did that he placed in our hand to be distributors of oh my god why is that it's so important because the work that god is blessing you in is not of you it's of him he just put it in your hands to distribute the bible says as he as he puts it in their hand they they come into this place and they're acknowledging he sends them away and says i need to regroup can i tell you if jesus has to regroup what do you think you've got to do how are you going nonstop without reflecting on what god is saying i'm grinding i love that word i'm grinding it out i'm giving it all i got i i'll sleep when i'm dead wait wait what wait hold on yes that is very true but i don't want to sleep that early yeah let me let me tell you about what the grind can do the grind can be so intoxicating that we live off of what the grind feeds us to do and the feeling of being important and the feeling of being busy we love telling people hey can you do let me check my schedule because you know i'm really busy and there is something in the affirmation of busyness that makes us believe that we are totally there when we've come into perspective because we have so much on our schedule to do i can't i don't know if i'll be able to make it why i'm busy well can i i'm busy and the problem is oftentimes we can be busy because we're in so many directions that we don't know where to go or what to do and our busyness is not a result of usefulness our business as a result of being sheep without a shepherd what you doing i think i'm gonna go over here but then i might go over here but if i don't know i might go over there and and if they let me in that job i'll take it but if they let me in that job whoever comes first and the problem is is you haven't had enough alone time with god to be able to seek his face and know his desire for your life and the bible's letting us know that he already has the plan written out it's your responsibility to discover his plan not to discover how your plan can work in his plan so as we're getting the clarity and we're getting the understanding we don't understand that the time alone gives us an opportunity to regroup because guess what we're over pressured anybody want to be honest we're over anxious we're over tempted some of us have been trying to eat right since january and today is day one again can i can i be honest with you anybody notice it starts today i promise you it starts today man i've said it start today about 10 times starts today all right i'm serious and then here's somebody you wanna go get a chicken box all right it starts tomorrow it starts tomorrow cause monday is the day after you just start making up stuff monday is the day after sunday so it sounds right to start on monday cause sunday is the do you just what i don't know i can't do it the truth of the matter is is if we got to get direction from god the bible says jesus pulls away he gets alone and he prays and you know what he does he gets his mind in order he gets his mind and all the bible says in in in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 it says we we're called to pull down every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of god everything that you think is better than god's plan everything that you think is better for you to have everything that you think is more sustainable for you to have the bible says we bring down those proud thoughts it didn't even say demonic it said proud thoughts of ourselves and it says and we take every thought somebody say captive and make it obey christ oh we take the thought and make it captive and we have it do what obey christ you got to speak to yourself yep we're going to go over there no we will not what do you mean no we will not we're not going over there well why are we not going over there because we can't handle it well we can't handle it should we never go over there what do you think sometimes you need that moment to talk to yourself here's what i suggest just don't do it while everybody else is around it's hard to define it afterwards you like what were you doing i was having a conversation with myself and what were you doing i was taking my thoughts captive what does that mean i'm not going to let them get far what are far thoughts imaginations the question is what are you doing with your imagination that you need to take captive what are you doing see your imagination isn't always about what's wrong your imagination is when you wander off with your own will i'm just gonna go over here we're gonna do this i know they called me to do that over there but i'm gonna go over here and we're gonna do this and i think this would be more profitable no that's what you need to take captive even though i'm getting the praises of men and women i'm gonna stay positioned right where god has me to be positioned because i understand it's more important for me to be in my purpose than for me to be following after people's opinions why is that so important because jesus understood that john chapter 6 verse 15 says and jesus realized that they would try to force him to be their king so he went up on a mountain where he could be alone sometimes we're motivated into areas and seasons that we have not been positioned for because of the approval and praises of people but the problem is no time with god hasn't given us the perspective of the right place to go so we keep feeding our information and trying to pull back what people like what y'all think about this you like this what do you think and the whole time you're basing it on the emotions which is the chemical transformation inside of people to be the confidant in what you choose for your life and the broken part of it is is that why i loved it yesterday i don't like it today so now what you took as being the answer to your problem i've changed my thought because time has happened to change it and because you didn't consult god you're living out my emotional moment the emotional moment of that i had you're basing your life opinions on it jesus says come on i need some time alone i need to get away can i tell you get away sometimes just be alone lord what are you saying what are you telling me what are you saying where should i go how long should i stay here is this right for me is this the place for me to go should i be getting up i know i'm irritated but i'll be okay help me work through this you need time alone the second thing is you need to get renewal somebody say renewal anybody know when you don't get renewal you are in violation time to renew those tags you don't get those tags or nude what happens you stay looking over your show did jesus help me if i can just get to work really quickly pastor how you know about that because i took the side roads to get there i took the way that i knew the police wasn't on oh yes i became very crafty because when there's no renewal you're open for anything when there's no renewal you don't have a better perspective when there's no renewal you don't have god's heart and god's mind sinning and resting in you you when there's no renewal here's what i said it gets me back in tune with god jesus went up on the mountain to get renewed to get perspective to see what god had called for him to do to be in the right place that god has for him to go to see all that god god what are you saying okay renew my mind guess why because i've gotten weary can i tell you that in your life you're going to get weary and if you don't renew what's going to happen you're going to follow how you feel anybody know your feelings have gotten you in trouble before come on now if you're going to be honest listen your feelings have you saying stuff looking stuff and you'd be coming back like i should i knew i shouldn't oh gosh gosh why didn't somebody tell me and god said hat you got time alone with me i could have renewed the way you saw this isaiah 40 and 13 says this but they that wait upon the lord can you tell your neighbor real quick sometimes you got to wait i don't like hearing that y'all you didn't even look at your neighbor and i told you your neighbor was coming he was like i don't want to hear that neighbor i'm not in the mood for that right now but the bible says that they that wait upon the lord if you have a bible i want you to underline this part it says they shall it says the lord shall he he has to it's not a part of an option he has to renew your strength but it's contingent on you waiting your anxiousness can be calmed if you wait on the lord it says if you wait on the lord he'll renew your strength it says the product of renewed strength or what follows up is they shall mount up with wings there is an uplifting you would stop going to that thing that uplifts you you will stop going to that person that you think uplifts you but every time y'all get involved you feel worse than what you already felt every time you watch it you feel worse than what you already felt can i tell you it says they that that weight on the lord shall renew their strength and then it says if you're in the darkest deepest place and it says they shall melt up on wings what does wings mean something is picking you up outside of you something is raising you up outside of your own self how did i get to this place how did i still do it in spite of it was the wings that got me up and made me feel like i was an eagle says they shall run and not get weary that's supernatural because when i get on the treadmill when i get on the treadmill it says run and not i'm weary 30 seconds in you hear that you hear that and i'm just like no no i don't have to do this i'm not here to impress nobody i'm not i'm not doing this taking it down i'm up here just casually walking on that thing like yeah yeah the bible says you don't have to worry about losing breath you don't have to worry about wearing out yourself you don't have to worry about falling in a place of deep depression you don't i'll renew your shrimp i'll lift you up and it says you'll be like that with somebody that has wings like an eagle and then you'll run and not get weary no leg cramps no acl mess-ups no bending up you shall be able to run and not get weary they shall walk and not faint you should walk and i think you need you need renewal you need renewal you need god to breathe breath into you other than that the enemy is breathing distractions he's breathing offense he's breathing quit just quit you don't have to deal with that let's quit you can just you can just walk out just quit you got to say to yourself no no no no i'll wait oh wait i'll wait before i react i'll wait before i judge i'll wait i'll just sit here i need a minute before i wait on the lord because i know if i wait the bible says he shall with strength comes clarity anybody know when you weak you can barely listen y'all i'll be coming out that gym like oh my god i'm walking up to other people's cars oh no that's not mine's i'm uh whoo and you're walking out and you're just like i just want to get home and just that's where i'm at and just lay down the problem is when you lay down you don't complete the assignment so the bible says he'll renew your strength then he gives you what feels like the wings of an eagle to be able to soar at a level that no one else can then it'll give you the ability to run not get wary to walk and nothing and the last thing that we need to do is that we need to get equipped i'm unapologetic for knowing that i'm here every week a pastor just because you the pastor know i would be in the church every week because the equipping of what god needs to do in my life gives me the ability to defeat the enemy in everything that he is trying to do against me scripture tells me he comes to steal and kill and destroy scripture tells me he walks around like a roaring lion see me seeking whom he may devour i understand that if i am not equipped i will fall every time to the enemy's devices i got to get equipped i've got i've got to get equipped i've got to get equipped with the word of god i got to get equipped when i want to stay in the bed and i feel like i can't get out and i've got to speak to myself and i got to say i am more than a conqueror today greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i am who god says i am i am not the tail i am the head i am not beneath i am above and when you find yourself in a place that you've never been before you'll say oh god's doing something that no eye has seen and that no ear has heard and that no mind has conceived so i don't have to run because i don't have a person to go to that hasn't seen this before because god reminded me in my word in his word that i would be able to do things that no one has seen before so i would stop running from the things that i haven't seen and stop running to the things i've only seen because the bible lets me know that faith is the substance of things that are hoped for it is the evidence of things that are nazi and so if i understand that i recognize that without faith it's going to be impossible to please god so i've got to have the faith so i now need to do something with the faith and the bible says faith without works is dead i've got to do something with what i have [Music] i got to get equipped i'm not just stopping at believing but i'm moving into doing because it's his word tells me i'm equipped to handle it stop running stop listening to everybody's opinion stop being so weary stop knowing how to be able to have dominion as a man of god and to live out and to lead my family and to be who god has called for me to be i stop being a woman of god who is timid and doesn't understand whether i'm single or married god is in my life god is for me god is with me and it doesn't matter what happens he has me in his arms [Music] [Music] am i quit i'm equipped to stop giving up i'm equipped to stop falling into the patterns of this world and i can be brave enough to say it's in god i live and god i trust [Music] but what if they don't like you and it don't work out it doesn't matter it was never supposed to work out some of you are trying to fit in where you were never called to fit in because you think there's a door that's going to get you there get you there is into the misery at a greater impact god bless us now first corinthians last scripture two and i [Music] it's just as the scripture say but god has planned for people who love him is more than the eyes have seen or ears have heard there are things that god has for you that is never entered into the minds of men and women and i want to tell somebody that said this to themselves i'm crazy for thinking this and god's saying nope you're right on point because the word has equipped me to know that there are some things he's called me to that no one else will have a perspective to understand because god is doing something out of the ordinary in my life so i'm going to tell you to tell you today real quick is that there are some things that god has called you to that you will have no one else to go and confirm with because it's not there some of us are so intent and doing it our own way that god's like i'm not i'm not i'm not trying to do you the same way i did them we all want god's favor but then we want favor to look like everybody else it's the favor of the lord that means it's different it's unique it's not the way everyone else does it the way everyone else sees it his favor is over your life yet you want to copy god is saying i didn't call you to copy i came so that you could be able to take fish subs which no one in the world has ever done and multiply two fish and five loaves of bread and feed over five thousand people that's what i'm calling to do but jesus we've never read about this before exactly no eye has seen no ears hurt and no mind has conceived that's why i'm calling you to follow me today don't stop now don't stop what god's calling you to do don't stop but god's calling you to go don't stop because there's crater that he has
