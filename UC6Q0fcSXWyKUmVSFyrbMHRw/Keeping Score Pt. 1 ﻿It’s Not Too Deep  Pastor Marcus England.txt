[Music] thank you we are starting a new series come on somebody say a new series and the series is called all get ready keeping score it's a series on here's what got laid on my heart on forgiveness and I want us to start here week one with a series that can impact and change your life maybe you're saying well Pastor I'm free from it but there's somebody in your life that probably isn't most of us all know someone who is suffering with unforgiveness the burden the weight of watching and looking at things that have happened in their past and their life has been stuck in neutral in that same space today I believe that God is calling for us to be free for our lives to change forever so here's what I believe we're no longer going to keep score we're going to ask God to free us from the place of burden and bondage that unforgiveness brings in our life so let's head into week one as we do it I want you to pull out your notepads I want you to pull out your Bibles why because I believe that this word can change your life forever we're going to be jumping into the scriptures in John chapter four and we're going to talk about a scripture about this woman this Samaritan woman this woman who who had a past and Jesus knew of it as we start in John chapter 1 before we even get to the verse that we're going to start at it says that Jesus is written that he must need go through Samaria I don't know if you understand it and I think it's prevalent that you get this moment is that Jesus has to go through Samaria it's not because he has to because there are good people there that he wants to talk with and celebrate with he needs to go through Samira because he understands there is a purpose and there is a mission to meet a woman and This Woman's testimony in life is going to change the very essence of the place that they're in the Bible lets us know that Jesus and his disciples go to Samaria and they go to a city called saikar and in that City they find themselves at the place where Jesus ends up at the well the Bible lets us know it's about midday meaning it's the hottest part of the day and Jesus literally tells his disciples Hey listen I want you to go into town and get us something to eat in and so the disciples leave and Jesus is waiting sitting by the well and the Bible says there's a Samaritan woman it doesn't even give her name in full but it says this woman comes to the well why would someone come to a well In the Heat of the day well it lets us know that this woman comes and she begins to draw water and Jesus is there Jesus is not there by accident Jesus is not there because he just felt like he should go maybe somewhere near Jesus was intentional about meeting this woman but Jesus also had a physical need so the Bible lets us know he was thirsty and he was tired so he went to the well if I can tell you that's already a symbol right there is that when you go to the well I want to let you know that you can go to the well thirsty and tired but what he is about to do in this scripture he is about to offer this woman something that will change her life forever he begins conversation and he begins to talk with her and and have a dialogue in this woman really brings in some issues that keep her from really receiving initially what Jesus wanted to do she lets him know what would you do talking to a woman a Samaritan woman he brings in race and he brings in gender and he says she says why are you talking to someone like me because normally Jews don't talk to Samaritans Jesus understood that there was a conflict between what was normal but he saw that there was something greater something more important something more impactful than her race or her sex or who she was or who she where she came from the Bible lets us know that Jesus had need to go through Samaria well I think this is important why we just come right out of election we have just come out of where there have been Republicans that have won we have come out where there have been women that have won men that have won we've come out where they've been Democrats said of one I can tell you this is that what we're called to do in the world is greater than what we identify ourselves with and the parties we identify ourselves with Jesus has come to do something special in This Woman's life in John chapter 4 we're going to start at verse 16 to verse 23. and as this woman has been introduced to Jesus Jesus tells her he says I have a living water that promise you if you drink of this water you will thirst no more I'm trying to tell you like me I get dehydrated I don't know about you but I just find myself trying to drink water and anything that will quench The Thirst but Jesus says there's something about this living water that would be greater and if you look at me and and we connect in this moment we start at verse 16 and it says this it says Jesus said to her go Call Your Husband I'm not gonna say this but I feel like Jesus is throwing a little shade he didn't have to go out that way he didn't he didn't have to start that moment he had just offered her the living water and Jesus goes to her and he heads right for the truth why because Jesus knows that the truth can set us free you know like Jesus you've been a little shady right here you you're acting a little funny why would you call the woman out because what he knew is that through truth she could walk in Liberty and freedom he said go call your husbands and come here the woman answered him him I have no husband Jesus said to her you are right and saying I have no husband for you have five shorty five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband what you have said it's true the woman said to him sir I perceive that you are a prophet there's there's got to be a reason that you know these things just said our father worshiped on this mountain but you say that in Jerusalem it's the place where people ought to worship Jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming we're neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the father he says you will worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews but the hour is coming and is now here I want to give that word to somebody the hours coming in the time is now for what God wants to do he says when the true worshipers will worship the father not according to a location but in spirit and in truth that is the very reason that I get to speak to you where you are and yet we are still connected through the power of the Holy Spirit he said for the father is seeking such people to worship him God is spirit and those who worship Him must Worship in spirit and Truth the woman said to him I know that Messiah is coming he who is called Christ when he comes she says P will tell us all things Jesus said to her I who speak to you am King my gosh can I tell you that's a drop the mic moment she's leading up to say when the Messiah comes he will share all of this he will he will prove who is right and who is wrong and he says woman I want to let you know today it's not about who's right or wrong it's about this moment and I'm here to share with you is that the Messiah that you're looking for I am he as we start this new series called keeping score I want to let you know that I think today God's calling for freedom and some of you are waiting for some things to happen you're waiting for some people to take place you're waiting for some moments to take place you're waiting for some things to activate and the Lord is saying now is the time I am here and I'm here for you I want us to come from the title of the message today it's not too deep it's not too deep let's pray father in your name we pray that whatever it is that we believe is so deep that we cannot heal that we cannot move forward that we cannot see you work it out in our lives father I pray today through your word that you will show us there is nothing to deep that you cannot heal for we love you honor and thank you in Jesus name can we say amen amen listen I I think about oftentimes when things are at a place where they seem white it's impossible for them to move I listen I want to share with y'all a story I I'm a little embarrassed to tell the story but I'm going to tell you the story I'll never forget when I was I was very very young I have to give this very very young because if I don't get very very young then once I give this story it's going to sound like I've lost some of my marbles so I'll start with I was very very young and immature and I didn't listen and I was playing upstairs in my room and me being an inquisitive kid that's what I'll call it I won't call it foolish I'll just call it I was inquisitive and being inquisitive I found myself playing with some marbles now I have these Marbles and they marbles look all kinds of colors and they look amazing and they look cool y'all know how it is and if you come back in the day there used to be people that would just sit marbles in a bowl because of how cool they look they look like candy or they they look like things that you could just have a little cool uh uh decoration on your table and so I had these Marbles and I found myself in the place where the marbles in my hand and as the marble gets close to my face I'm making a decision do I eat the marble do I put the marble I don't want to choke and so I take a marble y'all and I put a marble up one of my nostrils please stop don't don't laugh right now it's not it's not what's funny I I put a marble up my nostril and the problem was is that I could not get it out can you imagine this thing is in my nose I'm frantic I'm freaking out I'm trying to get it but I can't and then I'm scared that if I breathe in it's going to go all the way up and something's gonna happen to me so I run downstairs to my mom and I said Mom listen I got this marble and she's looking at me if you have a mother who has seen a lot you will understand pretty often that as I'm taking a look at her she's looking at me with a disappointment asked to say I'm sometimes unsure where you come from she looks at me and as she's shaking her head she's saying like I I don't know what to do my dad is there he's looking at me like boy I can't believe you'd have done this and they tried to get it out but it feels like it's too deep I'm frantic and before we get to the hospital because see when I grew up going to the hospital wasn't the first choice it was the last y'all know what I'm talking about it was the last result and as I found myself there my grandparents lived around the corner my father's parents and so I I they put me in the car and I go to my grandmother's house and I go in and you already know when you've messed up in life anybody know you feel so embarrassed you're like come on do we have to go tell everybody what I did but I do I walk in my head is held down I'm walking in and they said this is your grandson and we can't get this marble my grandmother looks at me and says boy what are you doing I'm saying Grandma I don't know but can we get this out she goes and she finds some tweezers now if you know what tweezers look like which I'm sure you do you're trying to figure out where are they going that's what I said to myself I don't know what we're going to do with this but I need you to help me understand where they are going she begins to take them and sits me forward so that it can come as far as possible she takes the tweezers up my nose now you know when you're scared when there's a little tear that begins to just come down the side of your face and you find yourself at a place where you don't want to cry but just saying this is messing me up she takes the tweezer she goes all the way up my nose and she pulls out the marble can I tell you that when the marble came out I was so free like I was so thankful that that thing came large out of my nose then you get this speech behind you and don't do it again well here's what I want to let you know is that I felt free I felt good I could breathe again and I felt like this was something so special that I would never do it again here's why I want to let you know is that sometimes in life [Music] what's your point that it feels like it's so deep I don't know if you've ever been there before but life can happen so much and it can feel so deep and bad that you're unsure if you're ever able to be able to feel what you should feel again which is freedom I don't know if you've ever been there before I don't know if there's something that's happened in your past or something that's happened in your life where you found yourself to be at such a place that you you panicked and you got scared because the way things looked it looked like there was no hope but obviously today if we're talking if we're walking through this moment then I believe there's some hope I want to talk to the person today who who has a past that has not been kind and and has not had the clarity I want to talk to the person who is unsure about where their ancestry is or where they come from or who their dad is or who their mother is I want to talk to the person who feels abandoned I want to talk to the individual who was hurt by a loved one or by a stranger I want to talk to the individual who had a family member or loved one or friend hurt by someone and it is lodged into your heart can I say that today it's lodged into your heart and you have been carrying the space of your past and because it's launched into your heart it's put you at a place where you haven't received the freedom that God has for you today I want to tell you today that in this moment God has a freedom whether it was your fault or you never even understood why it happened I want to tell you like this Samaritan woman that the Bible is letting us know that Jesus must need come through Where You Are today I'm excited because God is willing to come right in the middle of my mess right in the hot of the day right in the heated moments he is ready to come I feel so good to be to be to know that God will come at the hottest point of the day when no one else is around he will come and he will deliver and bring freedom in our lives but here's what I'm trying to let you know is that if you're not willing to walk in in Freedom you will stay where you are and people who are broken in their passing people who find themselves at a place where where they had let past mistakes and past hurts Lodge into their hearts they're only operating at half the person they really should be they're hiding they're avoiding they're walking away they're they're hiding in places they're they're they're keeping themselves from good friendships and relationships they they're walking in a sensitivity that no one loves them and no one cares and I want to let you know it's nothing but the enemy trying to destroy the future that he knows is over your life I want you to be able to smile today and understand that while you think God is keeping score he was never keeping score why do you think God was at the place where he was looking at every little component of your life and measuring you out I want to let you know that before the Bible says the foundation of the world is that God had a plan in store for you a purpose a a understanding that everything he created for your life was to include even the mess-ups the Brokenness the messed up past in your life I'm here today to let you know there is nothing that has happened in your life that God is surprised by but what he's saying today I've got to come through I want to tell somebody today that that feels empty that feels alone that feels broken I want to let you know today is that God says I need to come through I need to come through your heart I need to come through your past I need to let you know you are a man I need to let you know even though your father was not there I need to let you know that you are a woman I need to let you know you are not less than you are not not loved I want to let you know that God is speaking today that there is greater in you and it is not about where you came from it's all about where you're going today he came to free her and I believe this scripture speaks today that he comes to free you I believe that lodged in some of our hearts are things that we can't let go of because we've made them a part of who we are and God is saying today this is not who you are but the truth of the matter is is that lodged in us that feels so deep is that we feel that this is who we will always be if you can tell somebody around you if you could type in the comment section real quick this is not who I'm going to stay and be I am making a decision today that God you can do something greater in my life than I could ever imagine or even think and so I'm speaking to you today whether you have had five husbands whether you've had no husbands I'm speaking to you today whether your past has been broken or you've grown up what seems to be a perfect home I'm speaking to you today who have dealt with molestation I'm speaking to the person today that walks in anxiety and depression because of what someone did to you I am here today to let you know your freedom is not in Revenge your freedom is in forgiveness I want to speak to you today because I think it's important that you know is that the enemy is trying to keep you bound as long as he can keep anger and Hate in Your Heart we just came out of a series called heart to heart and what I truly believe is that God can change your heart today but here's the thing you've got to be able to begin to inquire of God lord if this is not who I'm supposed to be then I need your guidance and Direction on who you want me to be and I want to share some points with you that I think are really important to you understanding what God has for you and for your life the first point I want us to talk through is that forgiveness requires success forgiveness requires access many of us have shut down the areas of our life where we truly are under the impression that we're good where we are you ever heard somebody say that before you've ever been there before like no I'm just good where I am I don't need to bring that up I don't need to deal with it I'm Healed and you can already see through the pushing away through the rejection through the wall that's being built you already see this person has not been healed I want to tell you today just because you know how to operate in it does not mean you've received healing and that you are walking in Freedom does anybody know that if things change we can what we can measure up to where things are covet showed us that like straight chill some of us had never actually seen our homes seen our basement some of you had just met your children for the first time when covet hit they were eliminating a house and they were with you every day but you didn't know who in the world they are you just introduce yourself to your 12 year old and you said how you doing I just want to let you know I'm your father why'd you say you said because we are so busy and we're so uh uh uh uh busy with life and moving that covet brought us to a place where it made us stay still and it made us start dealing with things that are in us and around us and with us and if I can be honest with you I started noticing like hey man I noticed maybe this is in here maybe this is lodged in and I have been what using busyness to cover it up but today I want to rip the Band-Aid off today I want to talk to you because I believe today is your day of Freedom somebody just right in that comment section today is my day of freedom I am believing that God has something more for me than I could ever imagine or think so forgiveness requires access the Bible lets us know that the woman at the well started to reject Jesus anyway first of all you shouldn't be talking to me that's how she came at him she she had a little attitude y'all ever been there before when I was young I tried to go holla at a young lady before I got there you can see her face was all jacked up already like she didn't want to talk to me like uh excuse me I was like wait wait wait wait a minute you don't even know what I'm gonna say that's how this woman saw Jesus Jesus is at the well she is there Jesus is like hey hey can I get a drink of water and she's like excuse me you don't know me You Don't Know Me Jesus you don't you don't know me like that to be asking me for no drink you don't even have anything to draw with for the well is deep the Bible gives us this Clarity that as she begins to talk she already puts up a barrier anybody know about the barriers you've got in your life you say you're close to people you say you're relational you say you want to do life with others but as soon as the opportunity comes you're ready to bail out can I can I ask you real quick are you the friend that says yes to the plans already knowing that you're not going I like Hey Y'all we should go out you're the one in the back making all the noise yes cause we never we never go out y'all we need to go out and as soon as the text thread tells where the place is going to be and what time you go missing and here's the problem everybody knows you're the one you know she not coming I don't know why you would even invite her you know she not coming to here's the thing everybody knows that you're blocked off everybody knows that you don't want to do life and I'm trying to tell you today if we don't allow God to have access to our hearts all we will continue to do is to block him out of our lives we'll be like this moment and guess what we'll say to people I want to walk in Freedom I want to forgive her I want to forgive him I want to forgive my father I want to forgive my mother I want to forgive my siblings but the truth of the matter is when the time comes to move into action we bring up every excuse possible for it not to happen I want to share with somebody today that knows that they're in need of reconciliation that you've got to have access the scripture in Ezekiel chapter 36 verse 26 says this it says I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you I will remove your stubborn hearts and give you the Bible says obedient hearts I want to let you know today that there's something that God wants to do in you that has to go beyond your preference and it has to be about the purpose I feel this today we said this one last week if you don't get freedom that you can't really live out your purpose because there's always a stumbling block in the way that keeps you from fulfilling what God has called for you to fulfill so the idea today is you're required to give access how do I give access Lord help me to be honest with where I am Lord help me to recognize there's something inside of me that always gives me an excuse for what I can't do why I can't go and why I can't be I want you to surrender today the idea that you're too busy to be healed I want you to surrender today that you've got too much going on to sit down can can I be really honest I want you to surrender today that you don't have it to be able to do and I want you to reach out for help I want you to get access I want you to be able to take Pastor what is it that gives me the ability to take access you have to make in the decision with inside of you I don't want to stay where I am can I tell you the first thing that she did you started the dialogue she started the dialogue even though I had some sarcasm in it even though it had some I'm not really trying to hear you in it some of us aren't willing to start the dialogue I want to tell you today you need to go home you need to make the call you need to make the text you need to send the text you need to call the individual you need to DM them Facebook them somebody I want to let you know today is that you need to start the conversation forgiveness requires access point today that I believe that God wants to change you the Bible says in Ezekiel he wants to give you a new heart and a new spirit and remove stubborn now you may not want to tell yourself this but some of y'all stubborn y'all know you're stubborn right now you looking at me you don't you don't walked away from the kid the TV to you'd have moved away from your phone because you don't like this part of the message you're like I don't have to listen to that I'll come back and see what point number two is but I want to tell you today is that he says he'll remove the stubborn heart and give you obedient heart here's what he didn't say he didn't even say he would give you a fluffy nice heart God's changing your life it's not about your feelings it's about you already predetermining your obedience to him scripture lets us know he's supposed to be Lord of our life Point number one forgiveness requires access point number two to forgiveness requires desire when Jesus offered her a drink of water she said give me this drink of water now she was talking about a water that would be inside of her that she wouldn't have to thirst no more which means that she didn't have to come to the well in the middle of the day which means she didn't have to worry about running into people and feeling embarrassed about where she is forgiveness requires some kind of Desire some of us are living out of our unforgiveness because we're getting a reward from hating others some of them can I be honest with you some of us feel like we have power over people that's why we don't want to get forgiveness in our life we feel like we're Superior we feel we feel good we start walking in and you see that person and you like that they feel guilty because of what they've done so you feel you've got a power over them you feel you you've got to Reign Over them but God says today I want to let you know the forgiveness is not about them the forgiveness is about you as Jesus is offering forgiveness you got to say to the Lord Lord I don't know how to let this go but I believe through you I can let it go give me this heart to forgive help me to take the first step help me to make the spirit I feel this right now where you are the holy spirit is nudging in your heart and that is where the stubborn has to turn to obedient and the obedient has to have a desire to want to change my question today is do you want to change my question today is do you want to keep this generational Brokenness to your children or to your family or to your spouse or to your loved ones do you want to keep this as the way that you live or do you want to bring freedom in your community some of us the only reason that we're angry at the world is because of what someone else did my desire today is that you have a desire for change that you would have a desire for a free heart a heart that's available to God to be used by him to fulfill his call and purpose the scripture lets us know in Psalms 139 23 he says this David says examine me God he says look at my heart and then he says this put me to the test and he says this last part he says and then know my anxious thoughts if I could be honest today some of us we got some anxious ways about us oh can can I can I be really honest about this that some of us because of our past trauma we've passed it on to our current family members children loved ones and they are suffering in life because of where we have stopped growing somebody today your child feels smothered not because they're a bad child but because of the hurt that you went through that now you restrict their life and you call it being safe oh [Music] but you don't understand it's controlling see we're really good at redesigning our hurts to be something else that benefits us and we save for it well it's for the good and it's so that they'll be all right or we say you know I give this advice because of XYZ and the real reason that I talk the way I talk it the way that I speak it and how I think and and the way that things come through my mind is because there's a paranoia or there's an anxiousness or there's an anxiety or there's a depression that's flowing from a blockage in our life of unforgiveness the reason why it's hard for you to make friends it's not because you're not friendly it's because you intentionally push everyone away because you're fearful that if people got to know you they wouldn't like what they see forgiveness requires desire on your part the question is do you desire to be made whole do you desire to live a life more abundantly do you desire to live in Freedom so that God can change the very nature of Who You Are oftentimes I think about desire I think about the way in which we see eyes and often often there is such a freedom and just telling people this is where I am the scripture says David Rice examine me God and look at my heart and and he says put me to the test you know oftentimes we're asking God to do things in our life that he cannot do because we can't pass the test I don't know if you're like me but I took that driver's test twice now I think when I talk to my children now it's highly unfair because the place in which I failed is the place that required skill I don't want to get a little testy and show my heart but I just don't think it's fair anymore that we're not requiring people to parallel park I now you can tell me what I want but we live in the city and it wasn't a requirement for my daughter and so I remember hearing this um can you come and um park the car for me because I can't no no no no no no they should have taught you they should have taught you it should have been a requirement I think about often times inside of us how we desire for things to change and to go a certain way but oftentimes we limit ourselves because the truth of the matter is is that we just can't really see where we are so David said examine me and that's what Jesus did with the Samaritan woman he examined her he said yeah go get your husband she said I don't have a husband he said that's right you've had five for okay wait that's unnecessary that's unnecessary Jesus we did not have to bring up those hurts and past here's what I want to let you know there are some things that God has to bring back up in order to remove out of your life because you won't deal with it there's some things that have got to come up and the truth has got to come out for it and you said pastor I'd rather keep it buried and alone it's too deep to deal with and I'm here today to tell you it's not too deep if God can bring it and pull it from its root the Bible says he can change your heart he can give you a new heart he can give you a new spirit he can take out a stubborn heart and give you a heart of obedience we got a desire change we got a desire to forgive we got to desire to stop holding it and stop talking about it and stop allowing it to be the very excuse that we use for every reason of why we don't move forward in our lives and we've got make change and last point point number three which I really believe is that forgiveness requires truth somebody say some truth oh we got we got to talk about the truth y'all and you shall know the truth and that truth the Bible says will set you free Jack Nicholson told us that we can't handle truth but what he didn't understand is that scripture says in the truth comes our freedom I want to let you know today there are some things that have taken place in your life that need truth to them when we bring people to a place and we say hey you know what it's not needful that you know that that we leave people in the place where we deprive them of knowing what Freedom looks like if I could tell you this today is that oftentimes we find ourselves in this place where where we love to be able to gloss over the truth we like to make the truth feel and be what we want it to be but I'm saying to you today is that there is a truth that God has that is not a truth to hurt you it's not a truth to humiliate you it's not a truth to dig up your past so that you hurt it's a truth to hear me said you free that's a phenomenal thing right now it's a truth to set you free some of us have been in bondage for so long because we are so afraid of the truth coming out about what people will think about us will stay in bondage just to keep people happy the problem is today is that I hear the Lord saying but you're not happy you're not free you're not delivered some of us need to forgive and if I can be honest some of us need forgiveness some of us need to ask people will you forgive me some of us are not on the side where we are the offended some of us on the side where we are the offender and today no matter where you are Jesus has need to come through no matter how deep it is in your family Pastor you don't know what this could raise up here's the thing you don't know what it can bring it can bring freedom you've been living this way for 20 years it's been a burden it's been wait on you every time you see it it hurts again every time you're in that position it brings it all up again because there is no closure and there is no healing I'm here today to tell you your life can change but forgiveness requires truth I have to be truthful Psalms 51 1-2 is David was in a place where he understood that his very actions did not only hurt himself but it brought about the death of a man and it brought about the Disobedience of a king which brought about an offense to his God David says this have mercy on me o God according to your unfailing love according to your great compassion he says this blot out my transgressions what does that mean blot out my sins my mistakes my errors he says blot them out and he says wash away all my iniquity he says cleanse me from my sin the truth of the matter is that we have all sinned scripture says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God but I can shout right now y'all know me I love shouting on point three why because there's something about knowing that when God is able to deliver you through truth and that truth can set you free then you are at the best place possible for change to take place I want to tell you you are on the course God comes through and he changes and he makes things brand new and you're saying the Day pastor I rather stay where I am and I am telling you today don't allow unforgiveness stubbornness your past Brokenness the hurt and pain to stay where you
