about Legacy and I think about the legacy of my children I think about the Legacy that I desire to leave in the world I think about the Legacy that God has set over my life to be something greater than the material things the Bible says be careful in treasuring the things that moth and rust can destroy but it says to treasure those things that are eternal and I believe that as I thought about a race for legacy I thought about my grandson and last night I a daughter dropped off our grandson in anybody knows that when you get a Active Child the ability to get a lot of things done [Music] is very limited I don't care if you're watching a nephew I don't care if you're watching a niece it doesn't matter if it's a friend's baby you know when you get a child the productivity of what your day is going to look like comes to a slim place and we had our grandson yesterday and I have plans set up because in our household we communicate well [Music] and I set myself up because we're we're going to eat here and we're going to do this and things are going to go well and my wife says to me oh real quick somebody's coming over I said okay who is this she said you're you know because when when you want it to mean something you give ownership to the other person she said your grandson is coming over I said he didn't ask me if he could come over she said well he said he's coming over anyway so now I'm rearranging the plans and reconfiguring what I want to do because I'm talking about I want to get crabs and I'm going into this whole list of things but once he comes he disrupts some of the plan
