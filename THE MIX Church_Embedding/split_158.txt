t to get it together you got to get it together why because if you don't change where your mind is if you don't transform where you are you are going to sink deeper into the sinkhole of feeling bad about yourself and becoming a victim and now you begin to not think about what God has done but you begin to think about all the things that did not go the way you thought them should they should go and here is what you start to believe this seems familiar but the Bible says we gotta learn to encourage yourself the scripture says in Psalm 42 and 11 David said this why why are you cast down oh my Soul remember Body Soul Spirit we've been talking about that it says and why are you in turmoil within me hope in God for I shall again Praise Him my salvation and my God what's one thing to do to encourage yourself you got to change your environment and your space of the way you think your soul is your mind your will and emotion so what do you have to do you've got to change your perspective and your mindset of where you are and the Bible says you have to be able to realize and say to yourself why are you where you are this is another way in Psalm 43 and 5 he said this why I ask myself are you so depressed of us accept our depression and say this is who I am this is where I'll be but he said why are you so depressed why are you so upset where inside hope in God because I will again give him what maybe the solution is right there I'll give him what um my saving presence in my God I'll give him what because your mind automatically begins to go and think about the things that are wrong it b
