for some reason i love the animal channel i don't know why makes no sense i'm a city guy no lions and bears around me i don't have deer i don't have anything so when i go on vacation i tend to fall into this space of watching animals i love crocodile shows i like i love watching the people grab the croc and fight with it i love the accents come on hold them down hold them down holdy pull them in i love all of it i love it it's my favorite y'all they get them i said get them i mean when i tell you it's the best i love it you better get that they get them and they're running after it and i get to watch national geographic and they get into my favorite which is the lion oh my gosh lion's just roaming and searching and looking and i watch because the enemy never gives up any kind of prey a lion can take down a little elk a lion can take down a gazelle a lion can take down a baby it does it doesn't matter because it just wants to eat but here's where things really get tough alka baby giraffe small animals the enemy will eat off of but the enemy really makes its greatest impact when it gets a larger animal because a larger animal feeds the whole pack see when it gets the whole big hippo they don't have to eat for days if the animal pack can bring down the hippo one of the most powerful animals in the kingdom and they could get it feeds the whole pack for days here's what i want to let you know is that the enemy is seeking whom he may devour over many people but there are some big fish that he's going after and i tend to think that your destiny is so big that he knows a takedown o
