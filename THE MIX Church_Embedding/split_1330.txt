ard three to five business days everything's three it's not two you got to express it it's three to five businesses we got to take three to five why did it take three because jesus wasn't in the grave he was in hell making sure he could so that you no longer have to be fearful but through eternal life you can live each and every day saying i am all that god romans chapter 5 verse 8 says but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners christ died already knowing how jacked up you were would be and still are he said i'ma die for you why wouldn't anybody do something for you previous to you doing it knowing that you were going to still do it regardless of knowing that when you did it you didn't do it so now that you did it he's got to do something about what you did tweet that [Applause] because the perspective is is he knew you the bible says before you were in your mother's womb he knew you he knew how you would mess up he knew you wouldn't get it right all the time so he said i'm going to sin my son and his death is going to cover your sins that's why first john 4 10 says true love is god's love for us not our love for god it said god sent his son to die in our place you were supposed to pay the penalty for your sin and jesus said hold up i'll do it it says to take away our sins point number two it's god's love covers our shame i don't know about you there's some areas in my life i'm not too proud about there's some there's some spaces where if you knew the thoughts if there were bubbles you would pull me off this this stage
