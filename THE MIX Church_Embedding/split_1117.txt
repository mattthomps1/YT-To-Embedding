s may have been just a couple days ago your high school days could have been a couple years ago your high school days could have been a couple centuries ago i'm just saying whenever it is you remember your high school and i'll never forget the idea and the understanding of of going to school and when i was in school i i i wanted to make a name for myself i didn't just want to be amongst the crowd and so you know charles i tried to do something and i don't even know why i came up with this idea but i started wearing slacks and khakis and i said i'm never going to wear jeans to high school isn't that crazy i'm going to tell you it's crazy because i don't know why i did it but i i tried this thing out you know oftentimes i think we we have to put ourselves in a place where we try some things out that bring us to a level of discipline because many of us we go from thing the thing without being consistent and i said i'm going to try this and i'm never going to wear jeans in and people started to notice see here's a little tidbit real quick that you can write down people notice consistency when you're consistent with something when when when consistency is a part of your life and and as you grow in it people noticed that you've been doing the same thing and you've been consistent with it and and in that consistency comes an outcome a return on the investment of consistency and so i wore them and people noticed and they started asking me questions why don't you wear jeans i said because this is my brand this is my reputation in order for me to stick out honestly um you know i knew
