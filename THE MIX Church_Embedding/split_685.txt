e Bible says he'll take you through every moment of weakness and he'll strengthen you I can be content right now I remember when my wife and I we married we were together and I'll never forget and we were going through them beginning struggles of marriages we were struggling y'all my wife had quit her job she started the daycare business with two kids when you start a daycare business with two kids that are friends the payment schedule I won't get into that right now God has healed me but [Music] I'll never forget I came out of a home my mother she she she cooked everything you know we do this organic we don't we don't really do the processed foods and I say yes ma' I know that's right because we we maintain healthy bodies in Jesus name and she said yes we don't we don't get into all of that and we we we we we we we boil it and we and we clean it and and we make sure it comes from the right farming even today I'll ask my mom what kind of salmon should I pick up what what's not to get and she'll lead and guide me but in those days in that season let me tell you something I learned about Mary stakems my God my God my God and I had to say I can do all things through Christ that's right that strengthens me the problem is you have been so stuck oftentimes in a season of the thing that you only know that you have no adaptability to the things that God is trying to do and the agility in your life is all about what you have been lying focused in on that only you can see only you want and only you want to do and God says you need to change up in this season this may be a Ramen seaso
