 learned in in in in back when i was a child can that jesus still save me and the question today i want to know is are you willing to allow jesus to save you even though he may not look and be the way you want them to be in a culture climate where things are a little bit tense and we're always on the edge and in a climate where we find ourselves always fighting for our opinion and our our our needs and and i talk about this in our church which is we have division because we're different and the difference is is i look different i have different thoughts there's different things that have impacted my background where i live where i stay what i do what i can have and the real thing about life is that everything is not equal the moments are equal relationships aren't equal finances aren't equal the way that we see life is not equal we all have had differences of the way in which we are able to comprehend this world but here's the problem we see it through our own eyes not the eyes of god and when we don't see through the eyes of god we miss what god is trying to say to us instead of what we're trying to say to god can i get to you real quick the problem that i've fallen to is that i am more about god fitting into my idea and mode so that i can serve him according to the way that i want to live but the problem is is that he is the creator and i am the creation when he is the creator and i am the creation i wait for his direction and then he lets me know what his will is the problem is is that we become so opinionated in our culture of what he looks like who he is what he should
