e i don't understand what god says they were trying to trap jesus because here's the idea that they had they basically said if we can trap jesus if we can get him to say guess what don't give it to caesar he said guess what what happened the romans would come and they would arrest them but if he said yeah give it the taxes over to caesar it says the people would have betrayed him and the enemy is always trying to sabotage your purpose and he's trying to use the trickery of bringing broken people together to create arguments that are posted in one-minute sessions that convert your whole biblical understanding and theology because you looked at one real and was like yup i agree with that that's right instead of having the filter of the bible that's what keeps us as christians from being more educated and how to handle our dual citizenship is through the understanding that we know what god's word says and we understand the world we're living in you have the old double citizenship you have this place where you're trying to figure out where you are who you are where you're going i'm gonna always let you know can i tell you real quick you're gonna always have dual citizenship problems for those of you that work out in the marketplace they will call it out at a company you're going to have what dual citizenship tension can we pray real quick no we don't pray in the workplace because this is not what we do and the enemy will always use the back and forth to frustrate one side to make one side celebrate and seem arrogant in their celebration and to give are out to say we don't care
