understanding because of what i've just been through all week long fridays can we talk about friday friday is the place where i am calling for all the comfort that i can possibly do fridays is a place where i i i do some things i don't normally do during the week because they can hinder me from being productive on the next day and because i know saturday is available friday means that all gets itself loose friday saturday i'm tripping yet sunday i got to get it together ready got to get it together got to fix myself up because i got to go in on monday [Music] the idea is that friday gives us a level of comfort to let down we say our hair so that we can be comfortable not protecting and watching over our job that has to be secure and has to be looked at because there are responsibilities that are owed to us to fulfill when we're in monday through friday the problem is is that the enemy works like that in our life is that he treats every day like a friday and he's trying to get you comfortable enough that you think in your mind that your purpose takes a break and your destiny takes a break when you don't feel like going after life anymore i tend to think that there's a place in our mind where we think that the enemy will rest on stealing and killing and destroying but what you don't understand is that even in 20 years he never stopped going after samson and i'm here today to let you know there's something that the enemy wants out of your life that you don't value the way that he does if you understood that i am enough as we just sang with tears rolling down our eyes and hands
