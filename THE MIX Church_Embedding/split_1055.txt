enship somebody say citizenship all right here's where i want to explain to you is that your dual citizenship brings about a tension in your life where you're trying to figure out how do i live in this world with a kingdom perspective and the kingdom perspective comes when i receive jesus christ into my heart and i become a children a child of god we are now children of the living god so now it means we have a passport which gives us dual double citizenship what we have to learn as followers is understanding kingdom principles that allow for us to walk in this world with a godly mindset it's important to teach this because oftentimes we're either leaning to one or only to the other and the reason that we're fighting so greatly now is because we don't understand that we're living out a dual citizenship which brings about a tension that happens in our life that we're always trying to solve instead of walking through just couple weeks ago the supreme court gave the decision of roe versus wait and it brought one of the greatest tensions in our country and i'll never forget walking through the tension because i absolutely believe that god is the only one and only one who can speak to creation he is the only one and i want you to hear me very clearly as i am speaking this a creator is the only one who can give decision to creation now the context of clarity is that we live in the tension in the world where all creation does not come out of the place of love and secondly the dealing of control that comes from a government mindset is not always for the people it's intended for and
