 that i can live out my kingdom citizenship better than i live out my worldly citizenship today i believe god is calling for us to live with a kingdom a greater kingdom mindset so that we can see the purpose that he has over our life fulfilled and declared in what we do and who we are can we thank god for the word today hallelujah [Applause] i want to say this to you today that i truly believe that god has something in store for you and in this moment i i get it i'm i'm so clear on that oftentimes i'm living in the tension of my walk with god here's how you do it you begin to ask god lord is this your will for my life is this what you have for me to do instead of walking down the lane of is this just wrong and right i'ma do this today is that wrong i want to go here is that wrong i want to be a part of this is that wrong i want to engage in this is that wrong that's a very broken religious mindset the mindset is lord what do you say i'm all about your kingdom i want your kingdom to come and your will to be done on earth as it is in heaven here's the best way lord am i representing what you have already spoken in heaven not is it gonna a pastor you know ain't nothing wrong with that you know what jesus did that y'all don't have to go back and tell me what jesus did you got to tell yourself that as i've talked to god as i've wrestled with it as i've been in the place of going before him that's what he's laid on my heart but here's where i want to break that tension is that stop declaring what god and the bible says when you are not a reader of it and you're not a study of it
