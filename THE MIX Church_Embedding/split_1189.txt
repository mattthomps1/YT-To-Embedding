hey said roger that we're with you so if i were to go to my company commander who's over a hundred and say hey captain you need to go over here and do this he'd say what who you think you are lieutenant whose authority am i using mine it's not enough it's not the right authority now if i was in the if i was in the battalion headquarters with my battalion commander the colonel over 700 and he said hey lieutenant you go and tell the captain that he needs to go over here and do this and i said to the captain hey captain the colonel says you need to go over here and do this what what's the captain going to do roger that move out smartly right whose authority am i using the colonels is it the right authority to use yes so whose authority are you using if you're on your own if you're just doing your own thing whose authority do you have yours is that enough this is why it's so important for us to be in community to be submitted one to another to give our lives to community because it's not enough for us to just be on our own it's not good for us to be on our own because when we submit to one another then we get the authority and power that comes from above am i just preaching to myself now see i know i know i know what's real i know people been hurt by other people that's real and i'm not downplaying that at all because when we get hurt by other people our truster gets broke it's hard for us to trust other people after we've been hurt but you know what in a community like this it's safe it's safe to submit yourselves one to another it's safe to come into one another's homes it's
