go over this Jordan you and all this people into the land I am giving to them last week we're in Genesis chapter 12. and what did he tell Abram he said Abram I will show when we get into Joshua he says I will give there's a difference between the promise and The Possession in the stage of the promise God is showing you everything he has in store for you but here's what I want to let you know in order for you to get where God calls you to be you have to possess what he's showing you so he says to Joshua I am giving them this lamb to the people of Israel he says every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon I have given to you he says just as I promised Moses if we jump to verse 7 he says this only be strong tell somebody beside you you got to be strong he said in very courageous tell him and you got to be courageous being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left that you may have good success wherever you go the Lord let's promise Israel you shall walk into your possession but I wanted to give you a picture that sometimes the things that God has promised you do not always come into fruition the way that you want them to here's what I want to tell you whatever God has planned for your life is not even about you it's about the impact that you will make in the world it's about the change that you will make in a generation it's about the curse that you will break that will break forth a generation to live out the purpose and plan that God has for you whatever it is that God is blessin
