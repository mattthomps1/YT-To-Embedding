e trying to get direction many people have you encamped around you that can hear the voice of God that you listen to more than when you only get in trouble who's around you hey real quick I was thinking about this thing real quick I wanted to get some context I want you to pray with me on it what do you think you know why it's so important for us to have the right people in our life because without the right people they would never let you give up your Birthright because you're exhausted you you some people are around you you need some people around you who we all about to do your dirt they exclude you because they see more in you than you see in yourself you know what we doing tonight bro we thought to get high you'd be like let's go they'd be like no you're not going why why I'm not going you you not out that claro that's that's not for you why isn't it for you why isn't this for me because I see something different in you and even though I can't get myself together I'm not gonna mess you up because I see something on the inside of you that I'm Not Gonna Let Die and then I'm not willing to compromise because I want to act a fool do you like some loyal people around you that will look at you and say I promise you you will not mess it up you are our ticket out of here no no no cause you don't understand some people are riding on you and they can't afford for you to mess it up you listen real quick you know man I'm about to I'm just out here I'm about to do whatever and they're like no no no no no no no no you need some people in your life that are going to say to you you ha
