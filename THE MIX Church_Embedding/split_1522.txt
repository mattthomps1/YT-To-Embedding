et's actually reimagine and rebuild schools differently because it was never meant to actually support black and brown kids to begin with so now we have a chance to actually do things differently because it's pressure they're pandemic no one has the answer which creates opportunity thank you for not quitting but i was going to say i i think also just to acknowledge i think um you know principal brown spoke to this just a moment ago is that all the people that are so educators or first responders or pastors or social workers right are all people yeah right that are dealing with their own things right at the same time and have these other issues that are coming from their own personal lives they have to bring into it and you don't think i joked with you before pastor about this like you always expect your pastor's always going to be in a good mood yeah no no pastor is a human being too right or your teacher is a human being and understanding that that is has a direct impact on things as well and how this dynamic happens and the pandemic is really hard for everybody i think that's really something i've learned about and tried to work through this pandemic is like making sure that i take time and something that charmander said before was you know having this like zero down i think i can't remember the term he said the power down excuse me power down where like you take the crisis and the stress of life and put it to the side for a moment and that's something that i've tried to do and i think that's a great technique for everybody because we need that right and that's something
