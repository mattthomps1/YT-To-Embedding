 thanking god right now he's doing more than you could even imagine or even think and i believe today that god is calling for us to see something greater the bible says that these men pleaded for mercy and as jesus entered into the house he said to them do you really believe do you really believe that i am able to do this and can i tell you that their answer determined the next movement of what jesus would do i want to put that to you very clearly because some of you have asked jesus to move on your behalf but the issue is is that in your asking you didn't believe you ever asked somebody to do something that you thought they would never do anybody ever been in that place where you asked somebody hey listen can i have a hundred dollars they pulled out he was like oh no i was just i was just kidding the problem is is that you had a broken expectation level of what could be done for you the bible lets us know that they had not seen jesus heal but they had only heard that jesus healed and in their hearing it convinced their spirit enough that their condition was so broken that if there was a chance that jesus could change it all around then they would ask him to do the very thing jesus response was do you believe that i am able to do this and their response to him was yes yes i believe it lord yes i believe you are the one who can do it and this is where i want to get you at is because there's something that you're asking god right now in your life there is something that you're believing god that keep can do there it's something that you're believing god can change there is so
