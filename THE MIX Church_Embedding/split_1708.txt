 you follow me god knows what's going to happen that's my version of it he said the foxes have holes in the birds have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head this idea that the christianity of what god is supposed to do for me is about me following him and then in return him giving me what i want is a false representation of what we've been called to be and so now we're offended at god and people and the church and the pastor because you lied to me because i'm not seeing the product of what i want to see but the problem is is that you never sowed a heart of discipleship to god in the beginning to see him do for you what he does for his followers you're not a follower unless you what release yourself he says this unless you give up your life you'll never actually get it and we have false expectations of what we want to see god do because all we want to think about is where we used to be can i tell you that some of the greatest losses in your life is because you relied on your past instead of getting a new direction on your future and i'm speaking it today over somebody's life not here to convince you just here to let you know that there are some things that have gripped you that are wrong and you're living in them because someone told you that comfort was better than destiny so we've settled some of you have found yourself in the place like myself before where because you have obtained well only your mind could even think about you believe that god's done enough but the problem is is that you're so so far from where you were supposed to be that you don't notice
