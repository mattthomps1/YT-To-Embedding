hen saul says david you're the only one that has stepped up to this giant take my armor y'all listen to this because you're gonna need it and i've paused and studied this time like for real said god i need to see some see something this and he said this he said tell the people that the reason that david didn't refuse saul's armor is not because saul was a double x and david was a medium it wasn't because saul was a medium and david was a small you ever try to put something on us too big for you it fits come on somebody but you can't put something on that's too small for you are y'all hearing what i'm saying although saul's armor was too big it was too small for this battle [Music] and i studied the customs of how the armies would send down their biggest baddest fighter come on y'all watch 300 and they would fight and that would determine the battle those battles they were fought with hand-to-hand combat so goliath was dressed to have close proximity with david and hand-to-hand combat but the reason david couldn't wear saul's armor because david never planned to get close some of you have been so used to fighting your battle close proximity you've been so used to battling in the midst of something and god says no i am going to change the location without changing the destination david says i am going to fight with a weapon that goliath has never seen the bear saw it come on somebody the lion saw it my daddy ain't even seen it i am telling you right now that public battles are watch this by private weapons paul says it this way that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal b
