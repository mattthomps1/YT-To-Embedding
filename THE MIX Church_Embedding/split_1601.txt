rpose but as preparation and there are some places that you have mistaken because you have received success out of it that you have created as a career and it was only supposed to be a temporary season how many things have we attached ourselves to because it brought the fulfillment and the success that we needed to be able to make us feel good instead of us becoming who god called for us to be every good thing is not your thing everything that you are doing doesn't mean it's the thing you were called to do some things are position holders to get you to the next step of what god has for your life i didn't understand that god was positioning me for the space that i was in so had i gotten into that school and had i gotten into the place where i went professionally i probably would not try to be in the position that i'm in because i would have been so focused on my own will instead of the will of god so some of god's nose all of god's nose are the nose to get you back on track say somebody i got to get back on track because everything that you're doing that's showing results does not mean it's what god has called for you to do some of us are in place holders when we should be in purpose movers and your placeholder that you're in has been the security that you've been using in order for god to be able to not necessarily work in a scary way in your life because in order to really move out of a placeholder it requires faith in things that you cannot see which means you cannot plan the next step without god speaking in your life you can still be a great christian but yet stay right
