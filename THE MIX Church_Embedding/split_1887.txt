s strength here's what i want to let you know is that there are people that are watching your life that are trying to figure out how you are getting where you're getting to they want to know your strength they want to know what what has gotten you to this place what has gotten you the advancement what's gotten you the the promotion what's got you the the husband what's gotten you sir the wife what what has put you in the place of such blessings and the bible says that he was so blessed i don't know if you ever been so blessed that people just get aggravated with you you walk in the door what you doing man i got another blessing to share oh my goodness again oh samson was so favorable in the eyes of god that samson found himself at a place where they were sending anything they could to be able to take away samson's shrimp that's why in scripture we understand the scripture in john 10 and 10 where it says the thief comes to steal to kill and to destroy the bible lets us know that there's a woman by the name of delilah delilah if you have a woman by the name of delilah be careful that name sounds suspicious what's your name delilah nope i want no dealings with you delilah provokes and moves and and consistently asks samson where is the power of your strength and samson in his very literal sense says it's in my hair but the truth of the matter was it was in his obedience and when samson's hair is cut samson loses his strength and the enemy that he's been fighting all of his life and conquering finally gets a hold of him the enemy does not care how long he has to go after you al
