[Music] thank you can we jump into the word of God y'all we are on week 77 of heart to heart no I'm just playing we haven't been gone that long y'all but we are on week five of heart to heart and I really believe that what God is doing is speaking to the heart because out of the flow the issues the Bible says of life and so what I believe is important is that as our heart is conditioned to be in the place where God can use us the better our heart is the better we are amen the better our heart is the better we are and so as we put ourselves in position to have a heart that is before God I want us to end this series and conclude this series with an opportunity to talk about what I believe God is speaking in our church so we're going to get our hearts right we're going to continue to go after his word I implore you if this is your first week go back to YouTube go back take an opportunity to look at the messages as we talk about the condition of the heart we're having a heart our conversation where I want to talk today from is Hebrews chapter 12. and I want us to start at verse 1. we're going to go to verse 4. and I believe this is a opportune time for us to dig into God's word I I get excited about the word of God because one thing that is in this world is a lack of Truth and uh when I understand that I can go to a source that never lies when I can go to a place that will never try to fool me that doesn't have any other intentions I can go to the word of God and I believe there is a truth today that God is speaking through his word that he wants to speak to us so Hebrews chapt
