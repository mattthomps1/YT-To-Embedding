roblem is is that anything that God has called you to will never be easy it will always be hard to get over the fear and to get over the anxiety and to get over the depression and to get over the things that seem to be unobtainable but I'm here today to let you know that whatever God has for you it is what for you and Joshua understood it says God starts off of Joshua and says to him hey Moses my servant is dead that's a little harsh I could be harsh therapy what if you walked into a therapist's office and said listen I want to talk about my pet that died and say why do you want to talk your pet is dead get over it you say first of all I don't think you have your license because that's not how this works there's a walking through and there's a time a morning and there's a time where you have to get healing and there's a time where you have to grow and there's a time where you have to understand and so here's the thing there was a selected amount of time for Joshua and Israel to mourn but once the given time was over the Bible says he spoke to Joshua and said it's time to get up here's what I want to tell someone today in your healing it does not mean you are not to be mobilized God may be healing you at a part of your life but it does not mean you're supposed to stop moving where he's called for you to move what I get with church people is that we get the opportunity to be able to sit back from God say God you know what I don't want to do this today if we can pick this up tomorrow I would love it I would pick it up better I just today is not anybody ever been there before y
