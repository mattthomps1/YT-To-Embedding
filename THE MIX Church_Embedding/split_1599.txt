ake it happen and i i didn't know about the word possession but i was ready to possess and i'll never forget they called me and said let's get you into a room and we want you to do some things for us now i i i love drums i had played in church and to everybody else i thought i could really play but y'all haven't noticed you think you can do something really well until you actually get around some folk that can really do it well and and it kind of let you know a little bit about yourself without letting you know a little bit about yourself and god kind of reminds you you got a little bit more to go than you thought you did and i'll never forget i got into the room and and they said all right we want you to do a a a a couple of exercises and so we want to see some single flams and we want to see a couple of paradiddles and and and if you can uh add the flams with the paradiddles uh we would gradually appreciate it and i said well what are you talking about i've never heard of this before is there not a drum set that you have because i can really play a drum set like i do at church if you want to see me do it but but all of this new stuff that you're talking about i don't really know what you're talking in reference to and so i wasn't prepared for what i thought i wanted to walk into and had i gotten in the school i probably would have been so behind that they would have to catch me up to get to the place where i wanted to be now oftentimes when you feel god is saying no you don't understand his no but i want to let you know god's no is the best no that you could ever receive
