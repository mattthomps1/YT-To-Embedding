t on faith and there's people watching it's folk looking at you saying what you say you was gonna do how much you said you was gonna make what did you say god was gonna do for you and and i felt positive but when i looked back i saw people looking now there was only five guys but it looked like it was a whole game in my spirit there was 20. in my reality there was only five and they didn't care anything about what i was doing except for me to hurry up and move so that they could tee off as well but what the enemy is real good at is that when you make a decision to apply that in which you've learned he's going to test the very thing that you're making a statement to believe about and so when i got there i was feeling good until i saw people looking at me i said they're judging me i don't like them because they're judging me all of them i know they're doing that i stood up and and i hit knocked the ball i looked i turned back hope y'all didn't see that because right now i'm in the trees i make a decision hey should i you know should i replay this ball so i do i didn't even give this on the first service i hit the second one that went no way i just acted like it never happened i kept walking and i went into the trees down in the bushes and i got back on the fairway and guess what and then i got on the green and i got me a good par four definitely just right in the hole i felt good i said look at me lessons are paying off you ever been there before you applied the word and the word worked and you said look at me i will tear satan up i wish he would play with me i am a king's ki
