n Freedom together I'll wait on you because I remember when I was broken and I remember when I didn't have it all together and I remember when I needed someone to be there with me so just stick with me a little while I understand in the moment that you're dealing with it it seems like I'm all but you got to tell your neighbor real quick just stick with me some of you looked at a stranger and was like uh I'm not sure if I should say that just say it the idea behind it is is you have to learn that if you can become like a tree planted by the rivers of water you could bring forth fruit in the season that God has for you but if you're not willing to walk through anything you don't know how to live worry free when all hell is breaking loose it is the enemy's design that you would be disconnected from the father so that every time worry hits your life you will bust out cry and make a scene of yourself because you don't know how to handle trials and tribulations I remember when my wife and I we got married when when when everybody knows when you you're by yourself I remember I had my apartment y'all I had my apartment and and they would come over and you know when other people come into your space they they do stuff to it now if it don't bother you how your stuff is and it's not a conversation for you but if you got a hinge a tinge of a little bit of an OCD you you're trying to get your life right put the shoes on the shoe mat where the shoe mat says Schumacher that's easy I don't understand why you can't do it when you walk into my house take your shoes off and put the booties on
