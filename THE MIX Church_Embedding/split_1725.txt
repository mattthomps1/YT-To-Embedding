 don't believe that the cross has the ability to do the work that it does so when you stay in the place of i'm disqualified what you're saying is the cross's blood does not work enough for me and i'm here today to let you know is that the blood of jesus covers somebody say all all sins i don't care what you've done i don't care who you've done it with i don't care where you did it i don't care the way in which you did it the blood of jesus covers all sins once i believe that god covers all sins then i believe that i'm invited into the family of god as i believe i'm invited into the family of god i believe i have the privileges as a child of god when i believe i have the privileges as a child of god then what i understand and clarity is that as a child of god that means god has blessings that are specifically for me not because i've seen it but because i've heard that he has something for me i've read he has something for me this is what these two blind men they heard that jesus was passing by can we go back real quick and and look at matthew chapter 9 and i just want to look at one verse in a different version verse 29 and it says this then jesus put his hands over their eyes and said you will have what your faith expects you will have what your faith expects some of us are mad because we went to god in prayer but our faith didn't align up with our request and god's word is saying your faith is producing your expectation your faith is producing your expectation what you are seeing is a result of what you are believing i want to let you know that that's a easy place for us t
