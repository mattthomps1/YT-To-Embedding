hey were in obedience with god when you're not you feel it come to church pastor you ain't have to do all that that was the first service you ain't had to do all that he was trying to hit me hard i wasn't trying to hit you hard i was just reading what the bible says and the reason their shame is because you're trying to do something that you have not been given the okay to do now let me tell you something real quick here's where we suffer in our scripture and in our understanding because what we want is in marriage which i'm going to get to is this husband that leads by god this godly man and then we want husbands these wives who are submissive and here's where we're going to run into the problem nobody's leading and nobody's submitting and why is that because we created pathways in our dating that created spirits that now live in our marriage so you're having premarital sex and what's happening is because you're sneaking and you're lying and you're being deceitful you're expecting it to resolve because you get married but the problem is is you started sowing a seed to something that cannot die unless it's destroyed and the only way it can get destroyed is by god breaking the bondage of it and so when you do things outside of the will of god you open the portal now you have a man in marriage that you're expecting to be godly and to lead but the problem is is because there was lustful intent in the premarital state of being married this person now struggles with hearing the holy spirit and being connected to the holy spirit why because we started off ignoring god so what do
