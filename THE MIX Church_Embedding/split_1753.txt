ays it says jesus calls him he says children now i'm going to lie to you if if if if if you're from baltimore none of us is turning around when someone yells out children you know one of the most offensive things you can say is hey little boy i know they ain't talking to me don't something rise up in you i know i know i'm not even turning around i know they're not talking to me but at times even an offense we still need to be okay with moving see most of us stop at a fence and don't go any further than where we are the bible says jesus called them children that's all right what instructions are you giving me because even if i'm offended right now i won't let offense stop my blessing [Music] my question is is how many times have you allowed someone offending you to stop the blessing that god has for you because you could not handle the set of circumstances that were before you he says to them children do you have anything to eat do you have any fish and it says and they answered them no we don't even know who that is but there's a possibility i think that it could have been this collective of you think could that could that be look i'm can i share something with you real quick in in my time of prayer most people get a word for everybody else when i pray and read my word god is giving me a word for me and the word for me isn't always about how much he's blessing me sometimes in my devotions god is reminding me that he already spoke a word i just haven't moved sometimes when when when i'm in my word god is reminding me that the decision that i have made and where i am going he
