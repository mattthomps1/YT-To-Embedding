 name somebody say amen thank you so much amazing musicians y'all can you help me give it up for our amazing dream team our volunteers that are in the house can you help me just love on them real quick you might be saying pastor why would you choose that scripture out of all scriptures that you could have chosen to talk about joy you could have went to nehemiah you could have went to hebrews chapter 12 and talked about the joy that was set before christ why would you go through this area of walking us through talking about the deeds of the flesh and the deeds of the spirit because what i want to introduce to you in this space is a joy that god is offering you that does not come according to the set of circumstances of where your life is but it's a joy that's grounded in understanding and knowing who god is i want to get you out of a place where your idea is the only way that i can be happy if things are going the way that i want the time that i want with the people that i want and the space that i want and my happiness is contingent upon what it is that's happening in my life the bible is letting us know that there is something that happens in the spirit that is greater than the joy that we can just have outside of the things that our flesh desires but what he is saying is that a fruit of the spirit of god growing and operating in your life is something called joy somebody say joy see the ups and downs of life get us at a place where we can oftentimes believe that whatever it is that we do can give me joy if my marriage was just a little bit better i could have joy if if if
