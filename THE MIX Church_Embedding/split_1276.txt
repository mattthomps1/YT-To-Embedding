 whole ideal of life is working less i said do you know how many souls need to be saved i just i don't need that kind of prayer you need to calm down and take care of yourself i haven't been taking care of myself since i've been born jesus has been doing this anyway you need to make sure no i need to make sure that when i get to him i'm not telling him how i wanted a balance i want to get to him and he says well done that good and faithful servant that's my result let your result be balance calmness serenity peace i have peace in storms because my foundation is on something different i have expectations that cannot be achieved by what i can see myself doing of myself and without the schedule and without the vision and without the preparation i will never see myself getting to the place that god has called for me to be as an individual when you leave out of here when i leave out of here when you leave out of here there should be something missing in the earth because you are absent not a sense of well let's just keep going on because everything is the same way it was before because your life made no [Music] impact people should be scrambling when you're leaving this earth trying to figure out what they're going to do because you're gone because there's only one of you that could do what you're doing the problem is is that if we're copying what everyone else is doing you're nothing but a copied to the purpose of someone else so it's easy to replace you when you're gone you should be at your job working at such a point that when you go missing they don't even know what to do i
