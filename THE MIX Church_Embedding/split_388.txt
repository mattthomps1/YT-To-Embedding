 not what controls your life I'm here today to tell you that your circumstances do not dictate your life hmm anybody ever had somebody come to them and talk about the circumstance I I if you understood my life you would know that this condition of where I am is always limited but here's one of the things that I want to tell you is that the only limits that you have placed on your life are the limits that have been set within your thinking and in the way that you see life and they have brought you to a place in process where you have limited the great things that God wants to do only recognizing that I get limited because of my thinking I stay where I am and I never move from where God would have me to be I want to tell you that your potential is unlimited but your circumstances will tell you you will never get to where God has called for you to be I'm here today to be able to share on the first of the year and 2023 is that you have the ability to supersede and exceed a places that you have never imagined I am here to let you know this morning that there there are generational things that are weighed on your shoulders and on your neck that God has called you to break through and break free from but if you don't get under the circumstances if you don't get from under the condition of where your mind has been set you will live life with a constant lid of where you are and what you can do under the circumstances means that you are always find an excuse and a reason for the reasons that you can't be everything God has called you to be you've used your children you use your job y
