 sticking with me because i can't preach it to to lay the foundation the foundation already says in the book of ephesians that i've already have every spiritual blessing he's already done it for me then i come over here to the book of psalms and psalms says that if i'll make god my first priority he'll bless me what does bless me blessed means empowered to have success and so when i trust in god i'm empowered in every area to have success in every area of my life so then i gotta come over here to proverbs proverbs is written by king solomon king solomon is the wisest man to ever live proverbs 11 28 says this whoever trusts let me get that money back player i'll give it back to you who whoever trusts present tense in his riches this money will fall okay okay okay okay okay it's this this all right solomon says man if you trust in this money you're gonna fall but i think it's so ironic that this is what we put our trust in i think it's ironic that that like the bizarre thing the wild thing the interesting thing the crazy thing the give me another attitude give me something else the what the phenomenal thing yeah whatever it is is that we will spend our entire lives trying to figure out how to put security in this this thing keeps us up at night you will allow this to rob you of sweet sleep [Music] and he says if you put your trust in this it's for certain you're going to fall but the thing that just blows my mind is the theme that we're not supposed to put our trust in that so many of us does actually tells us what to put our trust in i don't care if it's the one all the way
