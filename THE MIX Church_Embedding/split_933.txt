u see when you know that eternity has changed you want to change someone else's what's your testimony today hey listen i gotta let you know this saint jesus but the bible listen man i don't believe in that bible i'm not asking you to believe in the bible i'm asking you to believe in the resurrection i'm asking you to believe in the eyewitness i'm not asking you to believe in church i'm asking you to believe in him who was raised from the grave we're trying to convince people about the bible in church but the problem is is we're not convincing them of the testimony the question is do you have a testimony because without a testimony you don't really have a purpose for seeing the reason of praying for 21 days what's the purpose of that well if i understood that jesus was raised from the grave then i will understand that he says now what all power is what in his hand so through that power jesus said what the same power that raised jesus from the dead is the same power that lives inside of me then if i understood that i would understand the working of the power of god is in me when i flow and when i do it's no longer about the laws it's no longer about church preference it's no longer about what i want to do i understand that there's a power that is expected to happen on the inside of me that brings about a result that changes the world around me and i'm no longer sitting there going back and forth about what the bible says i'm living out the belief of the resurrection [Applause] so now my hope is not in your opinion my hope is in the belief that christ has raised from the dead
