ecause that seed is somewhere on the inside that i need to uproot that's devotion not just a good message a good scripture to read for the day it's a life that's built on transformation so if your devotion isn't changing you it means that it's not devoted to you because a devotion that's devoted to you is going to change you so stop being comfortable with just reading a word and start being comfortable with the word reading you at three points that i want you to understand why you don't have the ability to be able to go back the first point i want you to get this is just really quick is that you can't go back because you've changed and you're not recognizing it because you still see old remnants of yourself but what i want to tell you is that if you've accepted the lord jesus christ as your savior into your heart right there you've changed now the first display that we're often looking at is a change in our actions but the problem that we don't understand is that that's a process that we walk through with the power of the holy spirit and the power of the holy spirit leads us to be able to live out the new us that's on the inside to see the change that god wants to do and so the change that god wants to do is not just out of your salvation for he changes your state of eternity from you being one pointed into the direction of eternal hell to one being pointed into the direction of eternity with him but through that now through what baptism the shedding of one's old self we are empowered through him who is the holy spirit that gives us the power to see the change in action tha
