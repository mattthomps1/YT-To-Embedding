hings that the bible says the problem is is i can't separate jesus from the word because john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god but genesis lets me know out of the mouth of god he spoke into creation what is the word jesus is the word and if jesus is the word that means the word cannot be false and if the word cannot be false then it cannot just be morally and ethically sound it must be truth beyond our understanding so the clarity in god being good according to the set of circumstances that we walk and live out of means that god is good according to the conditional state of where you are god is good if my mama's healthy god is good as loud as things are working out for my good here's what i want to give you the truth about today is that god is good jesus is good the holy spirit is good all ways for what you can explain and what you cannot explain for what you see and for what you do not see god is good the thing that we've got to get and understand is that the young rich ruler tried to separate and delineate between god being good and god being master and lord and god just being a teacher and the problem is is that you will put him in the category you want him to be in for as much as you want him to be a part of your life but if he is god he is god always he's always god which means he's always good he's always god which means he's always good which means that it cannot be subjective to how i feel you don't know what happened to me i don't but it doesn't change who god is god's divinity is not hanging on the balance of my opi
