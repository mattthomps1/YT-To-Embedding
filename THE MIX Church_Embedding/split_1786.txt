d of fixing you how about i go and fix me so they put a placeholder in a place where god should be instead of allowing god to tell you who you are and then when you get with someone they ask you what god said that's how it's supposed to look so when you start dating was god called over your life well this is what god called over my life and what god called over your life this is what god called over my life well let's see if we can bring those things together and operate but the problem is is that i'm not letting go of minds for yours and you shouldn't be letting go of yours for mine because be because now you're obsessed with what i'm doing and upset when god's using me and now you feel like he's not using you because whether i have a mate or i don't have a mate i still have an identity and most of us believe that it starts when i get someone can i just share something with single people real quick listen i'm gonna sing this last no i'm gonna tell you i got in trouble last time talking about talking talking it was i'm not to say who but there was a couple people that got me in the lobby and it got rough my security wasn't there or nothing like that and they got up in my face and they said listen let me tell you something you was on the men's side and i'm not playing you need to make that thing open and equal i said i got it sisters but i'ma be like peter and not give any more information the idea is that you're walking into something with an identity and a destiny that you're working on and that someone is coming in conjunction with not finding when they get to you anybody
