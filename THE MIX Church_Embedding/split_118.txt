 fire accompanied them in the Old Testament but in the New Testament the fire is in US are we seeing this and we need fire we need the refiners fire because that fire is a reformer that fire is a disrupter the fire of God is a consumer and it consumes everything that's not like God in your heart this is why when Shamika got up I hope I said I said it right or was it son Rica sharmika when sharmika got up and she said come on just began to pray and if there's anything in your heart that needs to be removed if there's anything that you just believe has just been in your way just begin to pray and ask God to remove it did anybody pray and do you want to pray again because mixed Church where you're going you're going to need to learn how to pray like you've never prayed before not just corporately which you already know that but privately some of you don't have a designated place to pray he keeps meeting you at the kitchen sink because he's good but God said get in a corner find a place in your basement find a place in your attic have a place somewhere where you go to pray and you seek the face of God does anybody want the mantle of prayer to descend upon them I want everybody on the count of three to shout Lord let the mantle of prayer descend upon me one two three and so and so we see in Matthew 3 and 11 it says indeed I indeed baptize you Matthew 3 and 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he said there's somebody that's coming that is mightier than I whose sandals I am not worthy to carry and it says he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire everybo
