came and then the second thing is that the herodians came now the herodians were a political group of individuals that sought the best interests of the government than they did the best interests of the people and in this government cohesion all they wanted to do was to disprove jesus because he was trying to put an understanding that he said i'm bringing forth a kingdom that is not of this world he said i'm i'm laying this foundation of what should have been working out of what i created from the beginning of time he says i'm letting you know that there's there's a kingdom that's not of this world that's not made by the hands of man and and and so they were trying to catch them i don't know if you ever had this before but there are people that in your walk with jesus they're trying to catch you slipping trying to catch you slipping and and and they like to use words like well i thought you went to church i i thought you was a follower of jesus when when i looked at your page it didn't really look like you were coinciding with where jesus is i'm just trying to figure out do you know him or don't you and the bible says they were trying to entangle him and they were trying to speak some malice against him and so you had the religious leaders who were at such a place in their life that they believed that the religion that they held superseded everything and then you had the herodians who believe that government superseded everything and it's a little bit while now we see there shouldn't be this this crossing of church and state but the problem is is this world was not created
