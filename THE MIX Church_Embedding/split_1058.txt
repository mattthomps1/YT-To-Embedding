does not mean i stop loving grace means i handle it under my dual citizenship that's why the bible lets us know we are to stop drinking milk and to start eating meat because those who drink milk don't have the maturity to have the conversation outside of the emotional space to include not only their worldly view but also their kingdom view and when you use your kingdom view you have the ability to understand through grace the natural means of what it impacts you and how it makes an impact in your life while you're still saying i understand what god says and whatever god says i agree and i'm in alignment with but i'm still working out this soul salvation so please excuse me if i don't have it as perfectly as you want me to have it and you feel offended because i'm not saying it the way you want me to say it what i'm doing is working out of the space that i'm truly in while also honoring god in the same space so the idea behind it is that i understand what god says and i understand the tension that comes with the situations that people who oftentimes create the law don't have any connection to that's why community is so important because in a law that's created to summarize everybody's thoughts ways and what it should be you need to be in community to work out what god is speaking on the inside of you so you have the ability to walk through the process and not leave the process to the idea of one statement i need people around me who have experienced abortion i need people around me who understands what god's word says so i don't rush to conclusions and become offended becaus
