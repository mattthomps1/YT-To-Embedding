s that we're here with purpose we hear understanding that god wants to do something in us through us and for us but we have to be at a place where we can receive everything that god wants to speak satan do and so as i keep pushing and pushing the envelope as your pastor what i am pushing you to do is move beyond the comfort zone of what you decided in your salvation to something greater of what you've decided to do beyond your salvation which is to become a true follower of jesus christ the bible says in john 10 and 10 for the thief comes to steal to kill and to destroy but jesus said i come that you might have life and have that life to the full but if we are not careful we will allow the enemy to consume our thoughts our minds and our emotions to be able to tell us that god isn't worthy of the praise that is due unto his name so one more time in this house help me declare in baltimore that god is good hallelujah hallelujah he is good he is worthy he is great [Applause] all right you can have your seat just tell your neighbor he's a nice guy he's a nice guy he's all right y'all don't have to worry [Music] sometimes you need somebody in your life to get you to where you want to be and it's not always with the option it's with the urgency that god wants to do something in us through us in for us and i believe today that i am excited i'm excited and what i believe that god has just been laying on my heart is just this spirit of clarity that we are called as a church to help people break through the barriers and the bondage that the enemy loves to keep on our minds our bodies
