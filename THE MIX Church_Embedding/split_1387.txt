ts of this grease this sausage because that little headache gonna start coming because this sausage is supposed to be sausage we pray and we've got to feel desires that are according to what our body needs not what our body wants we act too much out of what we want and not enough out of what we need and because the holy spirit said most of the time what you want is closer than what you need so we go to the things that satisfy the desire really really quickly not thinking about the after effects of what it does into our life and we say no that's not gonna fill me up that's not gonna really fill me up i need this and i need a good cup of coffee and i need a bunch of packs of sugar and cream so coffee don't even taste like coffee no more it's like a milky slushie and you're drinking it and you're hitting it and you're saying i need it because that's what an addiction to the wrong things will tell you is that you need the things that you don't actually need you just want them and the enemy is good at confusing our needs with our wants i need that car no no no you want it because if you really need it you would have done what you needed to do to be able to afford it [Music] but because i want it i'll jeopardize i'll jeopardize my future i'll jeopardize my finances i'll jeopardize my legacy i'll jeopardize everything just to get what i want and the holy spirit says i come so that in that space i can speak to you and give you clarity to what god is saying you need so you gotta fuel the desires you gotta go and and and get the bananas in and get the mangoes in and get get the fruit
