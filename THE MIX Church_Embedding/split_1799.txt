i i it's changed i don't really see who you are i don't really know who you are and if i can just celebrate us today is that many of us have been in a position where we wanted to quit but if i can celebrate you that if you're here today it means that you decided not to quit if i can celebrate you today no matter how rough life may seem at the moment and no matter how much things may feel complicated and no matter how much you seem to have wish things could go back to where they used to i want to celebrate you today because you didn't quit i want to celebrate you because you didn't throw in the towel you didn't give up you could have given up you could have thrown in the towel you could have said i'm done i'm finished but you said i'm going to hang in there and i just want to tell you congratulations you're still in the fight you're still in the game and you have not lost your battle not yet and with god on your side you'll never lose the battles that are ahead of you i think today is so important that we really get to recognize that when things in life tend to get hard we tend to try to find out how we can make it if you want to be honest somebody say easier can we be honest i'm trying to figure out how do i make this space of life easier how do i figure out how to not be as complicated and life not to be as so much of as a struggle and when moments in life happen sometimes you feel like throwing in the towel can i tell y'all i i picked up a new sport yup you can tell how athletic i am you can see it i'll just pose for you for one second i just want to take this moment beca
