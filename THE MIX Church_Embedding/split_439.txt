y give you what you want so that you can be happy or they give you what you want so they can get what they want is that a possibility that sometimes that's our deal with God God I'm going to give today but I need you Lord I need you to open that door now I I'm not I'm giving an extra ten dollars in this offer and I know you see me Lord don't play I need that promotion today like not tomorrow today because I got some things I got to do and so I want to give you a little bit extra anybody ever been there before I I've been there before where we didn't have a reservation and and I went into the restaurant and I said can I get a table for a couple and I said sir I'm sorry we don't have any available space and I looked at them I said you have none and they said we have none I said you have none they said we don't have any I looked and went into my wallet and I slid something past them I said you have none they said right this way sir [Applause] because the idea is that oftentimes if you give me what I want I'll give you what you want but the Bible says we have a God that's so amazing that he died before you were even here he considered you before you even got here can I tell you today as amazing as you are and as amazing and gifted as you think you have it together God is saying I don't even need you I died because I loved you he said I want to give you a posture of what giving is all about we give not because we get back we get because we love and he says I want to posture you to understand you need the kind of heart that gives out of love I don't want anything bad for you why
