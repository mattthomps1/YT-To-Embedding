 all the way down to get in the form of the human to put his life on the line so that i could have salvation and know him great why would a god come out of heaven's hosts where he is glorified and worshiped and adored just for little old me there's got to be something on the inside of me there's got to be some purpose and some destiny enough for god to come out of heaven to say i'll die for you so you can fulfill what i've called for you to do [Music] i told my team on monday morning i said if this is all that i have to look forward to in my salvation in my baptism and in the empowering of the holy spirit is that all god wants me to do is just get by in life then i rather do without but i tend to think that god has something greater on the other side of this for me that's bigger than me just coming to church but he's called me to something greater [Applause] [Music] i tend to think that you don't know the power that lies inside of you you don't understand that god didn't just give you what's inside of you for the case of giving it just to you he gave it to you so that you could see greater and above and beyond what you could even imagine or think he didn't give samson the strength just for samson to have it he gave samson the strength because samson was supposed to be a judge for the people of god god is giving you what's inside of you because he's called you to something greater than what you could imagine or think but to tell you the truth we don't know the value of who we are [Music] so we settle for careers and relationships as the greatest value that we have in this ea
