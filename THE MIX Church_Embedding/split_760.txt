re upon a time where the idea for most is to see themselves at a place in life where they we like to go after and live out life in the most comfortable way possible most of us are trying to find the the best way to live comfortably the best way to operate comfortably and if we want to be honest with it is that we are always at a place in life where we're seeing new inventions happen anybody ever been there before people aren't inventing anything new they're just making what's already invented better easier you used to have to go to a car dealership in order to buy a car now you can go online and buy a car without ever looking at it return it back in 30 days if you don't like it i don't know if you understand that is a different level of convenience you no longer have to deal with people that if you know about a car dealership and if you are a car salesman we love you but we hate you when we're buying a car is that it takes 55 hours for you to run my credit takes another 90 hours for you to be able to come back and tell me what it is takes another 45 days for you to be able to let me know that i got the car and it takes another 20 days on top of that for me to walk through the paperwork in the process i rather just go get a bike a scooter a motorcycle something that just takes less time in order for me to be able to buy because the idea behind it is that things tend to take longer than they should well i think as we are entering to a place in life where we're learning that we're trying to be better at everything that we do i don't know if you're there but now we have locks t
