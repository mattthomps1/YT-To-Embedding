ere's so much inside of you and there's so much purpose inside of you and it is more than you could ever imagine or think but if you sleep on god you'll never become who god's called for you to be can i tell you you're real good at your job but probably i just would love to see you be real good at your life [Music] pastor why you preach this message today because i believe that god is calling us to be disciples i'll give you a really great one i'll shout you know i'll give you everything i'll keep you woke but the problem with church is that church is way too much more about entertaining you than it is about growing you and the struggle that we work off of is we don't know how to grow so we just keep coming back for a fix and i'm here today to let you know relationship with god will settle your spirit when everything is breaking loose that you have no control over today i believe that you can stand the test of time danny real quick last but not least and the bible says when you spend time in discipleship it lets you know that seed will bear fruit the question today is are you bearing fruits because if you bear fruit you'll see the results i pray today that i not convict you with the holy spirit to do you see the results of your relationship with god in your life or has it done nothing but benefit you to be more prosperous in the things of your life
