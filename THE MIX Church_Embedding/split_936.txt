going the problem is is he didn't know he didn't know this church couldn't be broken but jesus got to him and said paul why are you persecuting my church paul looked up and the bible says within a day somebody say in a day i want to let you know and i just want to speak over somebody's life right now that whatever you've been troubling you whatever has had a hold over you in a day god can change that thing right now whether it be an addiction whether it be a way of thinking whether it be a broken mindset within a day the bible said saul went from being a persecutor to a presenter and he began to tell them the testimony of the testimony because here we go well pastor all we've got to do is believe the people that that were there but i don't know if they're telling the truth paul had to believe the truth why because paul said i know about this jesus and he'd be given to give an account that's so much so that he wrote most of the new testament and when paul says i'm giving the account on the account because i didn't even see jesus raised from the dead if i saw him i'd probably put an extra nail in there if you really would agree with me but because of the power of understanding that he was resurrected from the dead and this whole thing that has been put together it's all about him coming dying and rising again i tend to believe that who he is is who he says he is so paul says i'm changing my ways and i'm walking with newness of life and i'll die for the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation what makes a movement so great it's when i have a belief tha
