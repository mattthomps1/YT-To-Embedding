n't have to do it in a conventional way i don't care how he does it but when i pray i need him to hear me [Music] i need him to hear me and so that's what a living god does as opposed to an idol god and so david is part of this community and he is a young man that washed the sheep for his father there were eight brothers he watched the sheep and the scripture says that he was handsome he was ruddy you know he had that outdoorsy kind of look nothing wrong with that right it said he could play the lyra and and it said that he was he was bold he he was a warrior all those things sound pretty good and the king that they had in place of israel at this time was saul and saul had had disobeyed god on several occasions it's just so important that we obey the voice of the lord he disobeyed god on several occasions and the lord had told sam the prophet i have rejected him i want you to go to where i tell you to go and i want you to anoint for the oil on this man here and when you pour it this is going to be our next king because he has my heart david was known to be one that had the man that had the heart of god it didn't say david was perfect it said he had the heart of god it didn't say david didn't do any wrong because we see what he did but he still had a heart for god we see it in the writings when we look at psalms how david says lord look don't don't don't put me away from you do anything but don't take your spirit from me you know clean me because i didn't messed up again but just don't take your spirit from me please i need you and so he had that kind of relationship and so
