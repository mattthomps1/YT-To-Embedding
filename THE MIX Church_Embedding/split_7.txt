 your life from purpose and you give everything to this one space in life now you've lost your identity and the bad relationship isn't called to you because it didn't work out because you put everything into it you need to learn the lesson so let's talk about what the foundation and the building blocks are the first foundation and building block that you've got to understand is about you living Abundant Life this is from somebody say a kingdom perspective because what you're going to initially think is Pastor I tried that it don't work I'm trying to tell you I was not the problem they were the problem I will tell you that my therapist told me that and I just want to let you know I'm on the right side my therapist told you first of all your therapist is not God second of all they're there to help you move in your life but they're not there to be your life so stop claiming your therapist as your God because sometimes God requires you to do things that don't seem logical to the human mind the Bible says his ways are not our ways and his thoughts so if you know that and God could possibly choose something different for you why do you avoid him when it's time to receive the answer of what to do the reason I avoid God is because he might force me he might force me to do something that's going to require me to come out of me and to do something that would require me to trust him because I'm not strong in that area enough to do it by myself that's why the Bible says in my weakness his strength is made what perfect so I understand there are weak points that what teach me a lesson so
