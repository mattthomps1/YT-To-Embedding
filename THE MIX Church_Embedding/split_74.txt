 is not bad the problem is your life is not complete God is calling for us to disrupt the normal God's calling for you to be able to see your life operate in a way you've never seen it before somebody God is calling for you to operate and move into a season of your life that you've never considered some of you God is calling you to people while you are running as an introvert away from them some of you God is calling for you to take the next step some of you God is calling for you to come back home some of you God is calling for you to forgive some of you God is calling for Restoration in your life today but I pray that he could disrupt you from the normal Point number two I pray you leave here compelled to trust God I I pray today that you would be so compelled to trust God that you would have faith beyond what you could imagine or even think the faith to believe that God can do the impossible I God didn't die for you to stay we are God died so that you could have a life that is beyond what you could ever imagine or think the Bible says there is something that no eye has seen and no ears heard and no mind has conceived the things that God has in store for those who love them I'm just interested do you have the ability to live out what God has in store for you or will you continue to live out according to the way you feel which has gotten you right back to where you are second Corinthians says this 5 14-15 for Christ's love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for them
