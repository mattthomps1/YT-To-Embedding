g inside of me i want to let you know today i'm not apologizing because he's changing my name and he's changing my life and he's changing my children and he's changing my marriage and he's healing my body and he's restoring my mind i'm not apologizing because i've landed in favor with god i want to let you know today i've landed in favor with god because he already spoke it over my life it's nothing that i've done it's not who i am it's not about my last name but it is that die i am a heir with christ a joint heir with him i have an inheritance in him and there's something about the name of god when he speaks it it is yes and amen i'm unapologetic that god has chosen me i'm unapologetic that he's called me i'm unapologetic that the lord is deciding to use me but what i must understand is that when god uses me i have to know that when he's using me he's using me in the right way and the only way i know it's the right way is that i have spent time with god can i tell you today that you cannot build your relationship with god without spending time with god everybody knows that a relationship can only be built on time and the equity that has been put into it you cannot not deposit in your relationship with god and have an expectation to withdraw from the blessings of god everybody knows about this you've been in your bank account you can declare it speak it name it call it down from heaven but here's the context of what you've got to understand is that as you do that if you did not deposit you cannot withdraw that in which has not been deposited is that which cannot be withdraw
