you can buy your child everything in the world but you say don't touch that I got a little grandson we got things all over the house but we tell them don't touch the socket don't go down steps what do y'all think he likes doing I mean he looks at that thing like you mean that you don't want me to touch that this socket right here because there is something about the sin nature that is born within us that always creates this desire for the things that are not best for us the Bible gives us a Clarity and understanding that the serpent comes and speaks to Eve and as he speaks to Eve he spreads alive with the truth and he kind of merges it together and here is the problem is that while Adam has always been in the place where he has been obeying God and getting instruction when you have someone in your life that's not at the point of life where they can hear God properly the enemy will speak to the individual as a follower of Jesus Christ who is not connected with the spirit of the Lord to use them as an influential person to deviate the purpose and the plan that God has over your life because they saw it was desirable for them the Bible lets us know that Eve saw it and thought it was desirable here's oftentimes what I see in a lot of relationships even before marriage hits there is one person as a Christian who is seeking after God and there's another person lying dormant in their relationship the dormant person is saying we don't need to do all that it's not that necessary that we pray it's not that necessary that we don't have sex before marriage it's just being extra you doi
