n get some good food later on when i see it as his church the ecclesia the assembly place where we are to grow and manifest an understanding of what god's kingdom is to look like on earth that's why when we pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done where on earth as in what is in heaven god is trying to do something on earth that he's already declared done in heaven and he's trying to do it through his church but a church that is locked up in its perspective and idea of what it's supposed to do can never be a church that's powerful enough to impact the world that it goes back into because it only sees itself as a one day event that doesn't have the power to change anything outside of when it meets here's where the problem lies is that we haven't unlocked the true potential of the church in the world we've unlocked the potential of the church in the building that's why when we say oh we had church is when there's been a move in the building but the problem is is the move in the building never moves outside the building and never makes the impact in the home at the workplace in our finances in our relationships and in the way we grow so the potential of the church only magnifies itself in the way that it performs out on that one day and once the day concludes we no longer believe in the power of the ecclesia because we don't understand that the church is not a building it is what the bible calls a body just somebody stick with me real quick if you understand that the church is a body then you understand the power that happens w
