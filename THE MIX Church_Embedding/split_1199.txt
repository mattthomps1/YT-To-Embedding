truth of someone or something for example we can trust in the change of seasons in the winter we know that it's really cold outside and it may snow and this spring we know that it rains a lot and flowers begin to bloom and this summer it's really hot and we can swim in the fall the leaves begin to change and the weather is a bit nice we can trust in the change of seasons because we've experienced it and we know it to be true talking about trust makes me think about an experiment that i heard about i've never done it before and i'm sure if i'm not sure if it'll even work let's take a look [Music] what a cool experiment guys we can trust and believe in jesus and we can trust that he will always be with us just like he was with gideon in today's lesson we see that god's people brought trouble on themselves when they stopped honoring him and turned to other gods god had mercy on his people when they asked him for help the lord sent an unlikely warrior by the name of gideon to rescue the israelites from the hands of the midianites as we watch in the video we see that god used what the world would consider a nobody to deliver his people from their enemy gideon didn't rely on his own strength for victory but rather trusted god by obeying the plan god had given him when we trust god nothing is impossible our memory verse for this week says blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it luke 11 and 28 thanks so much for helping me with this week's memory verse before we go let's sing and dance to one way by hillsong kids [Applause] [Music] always there in troubled tim
