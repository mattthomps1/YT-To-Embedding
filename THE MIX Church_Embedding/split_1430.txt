othing like a grown adult myself going to speak straight on me trying to get into the water shaking telling the lord if you could help me walk on it better than i can swim in it i'll take that as well and i'm telling you that today because i i'll never forget i i spent some money i went to the ymca and i wanted them to teach me how but there is something about when you're called to step out that it's fearful because you feel that when you step out you don't have any support around you i went i i went swimming and and they tell you to get in the water and and i'm and the first thing i'm doing is i'm reading my surrounding you got to read your surrounding because i got to know how deep this water is anybody know you're looking at the side of the gauge i'm not i'm not moving until i find out the footage in this water i get in it starts at about three feet i feel good four feet my faith starts to waver five feet i know that the lord is no longer with me the bible says his rod and staff they comfort but it was not comforting me at that moment i step out into the water and i try to swim and they tell you all right here's what you're about to do you're about to leap out and kick your feet the problem is is that my brain doesn't have the ability to operate at the same time while keeping myself from drowning and making the decision to kick my feet because in my head my feet need to be on the ground so what you're telling me doesn't seem like it makes sense but the only way you can swim is if your feet are off the ground now you have the fakers you seen them they tall enough to be in
