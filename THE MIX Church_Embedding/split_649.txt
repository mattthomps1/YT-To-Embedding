once I get that one degree I'm just telling you my life is going to be brand new and you can ask somebody with a degree that is into their job and fully at the top and they'll look at you with the burden and weight of heaviness and tell you I can let you know when you get up here it gets weighty and it gets heavy so make sure you have a god plan for what happens when you get there because if not it will Define Who You Are and everything that you're going after when it stops giving you the pulse of fulfillment you feel empty in life you can work but feel empty you can go to school and feel empty you can drive the coops relax and the bins to all my friends I just want to tell you keep your head up this is not just for the East Coast it's also for the West Coast and it's worldwide let's just add that it because I want to tell you your focus matters today the question you need to write down is what am I focused on what are we as a family focused on are we split so much and where we're going that we have no Focus so where there is no Focus there is no Direction where there is no direction we have no goal to go out there where there is no goal we have no purpose so we do everything that fulfills us where we are some of you are going to destinations to find fulfillment but your destination doesn't bring fulfillment it is the purpose that God has set over your life [Applause] you got to refocus your priorities I want you to look at the scripture in Luke chapter 12 verse 33-34 it says this be generous somebody said be generous give to the poor get yourselves a bank that can't go ban
