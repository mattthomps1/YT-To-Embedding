world changers in nehemiah chapter one it's letting us know that israel has just come out of babylonian exile means they were in a place where they were under captivity and those in whom have survived have moved back into jerusalem and and and there is a special place in their heart but the problem is is that the jerusalem that they left is not the one that they came back to and the bible says nehemiah is a cup bearer to the king artaxerxes and it says as he's talking with some friends that have come back they start giving him an update about where the kingdom is where the place that he comes from and when he starts to hear the condition of his community the condition of his city the bible says he begins to mourn and they tell him the walls of jerusalem have been broken down and it says and the gates have been burned and the people are in disgrace and the bible says it hits nehemiah so hard that he begins to mourn the place and where he comes from the bible says but he just doesn't stay there tell somebody real quick don't stay there it says he doesn't stay there buddy he gets himself to a place where something inside of him says i'm feeling something so i've got to do something if i can tell you this today don't rest where you are don't rest in the situation you are if you're feeling something then ask god how can i do something and it says and nehemiah gets before the king and that's where we're going to pick up in nehemiah chapter 2 starting at verse 1 and it says this in the month of nisan it says in the 20th year of king artaxerxes it says when the wine was before him
