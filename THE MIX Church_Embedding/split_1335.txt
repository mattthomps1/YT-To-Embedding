hear this from my father when i get there so i'm just i'm getting myself together and i'll just take it and it says the father who is so loving he says i see my son coming i see my daughter coming they didn't let their brokenness hinder them from coming i see them from afar it says when he when he got close he said there was such a celebration that he found himself in a place where he he yelled to his servants get the best robe and the bible says he they went and ran and it went and said okay we got you we got you here you go and it says they begin to put it on them and you know what it did the robe covered [Music] it says i got you you set your mind but he also wanted to let him know that not only as a father was he covering him but he was putting him back in position and so he said i'm not only going to cover you but but but i got this ring for you it says and i want to put this ring on you and and and i want you to know that let me get a pinky because that's where the real play is put it all out let me get that he said i'm going to cover your sin and i'm going to put you right back to where i already had you he says i'm not demoting your purpose i'm not taking away your purpose i'm not taking away your blessings everything that's done in heaven shall be done on earth he said i've got you covered he says i place you back in the position being a son and being a son still means there's still an inheritance [Music] and everything that god has for you i want to let you know today is still for you you have not been revoked you have not been put to side you have not been revoke
