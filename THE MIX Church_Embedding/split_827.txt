ople who operate out of what we see and set up what we believe and because we only operate out of what we see we limit ourselves to what God can do in our life because the Bible says that faith is the substance of things that are hoped for it is the evidence of things that I have not seen why would God try to do something in your life that you've already seen when he's a god of miracosa and a god of things you've never seen in your life before I'm trying to tell you God needs to hide what he's doing to make sure that your faith can rise up to the situation of what he wants to do in your life I'm trying to tell you today that the enemy has been working so well to distract you because he's playing with your mind keep you from believing that that in which God has spoken is already yes and amen so he creates a distraction that seems so severe to you that you begin to waver in your belief can he do what he said he can do and now we find ourselves focused in our situation mourning and weeping about what we believe has taken place but yet we don't know that the Bible said in three days she was going to rise again if they had gone back and read if they had gone back and taken a moment to review what the prophets had told what Jeremiah had spoken what they had spoken in Isaiah they would have understood this was only a temporary thing but if they could have grasped a hold of their mind to reach an understanding that if I could just hold on just a little bit longer I would recognize that he is not dead he is yet alive and living and moving and breathing calm down Marcus [Applause] be
