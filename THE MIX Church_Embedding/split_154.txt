d this was going to be the best season of your life what God has anointed you and purpose you to do something more than you could imagine a thing and the only result of it right now is you feel like you're stuck you feel like God is against you and he's not for you you feel like there's an opportunity in a moment for God to be able to use you and somebody is saying right now in their prayer time God now is the time and in it the Lord's saying not yet hmm I don't like him not yet you know what I really don't like don't prophesy to me and don't let me go don't anoint me and then tell me you got years before you gonna do it the audacity that you would declare purpose over my life and then take me through process in the world why would you anoint me if I'm not ready because I want to let you know that I have a promise for you but even though the promise may not be fulfilled yet I just want to let you know you're already called to what God's called you to can I tell somebody today just take a minute and breathe and slow down and understand where you are is on purpose where God has you it's a season of your growing and you're learning because what he doesn't want you to do is go back to the same place that you are doing the same thing that you did he's trying to become understand that you will become a Victor in the place that you are and that you could actually fulfill the purpose that God has for your life but here's what we do we get anointed and we get arrogant you know you know he called me King right you know he he called you you understand how much money I'm about to make
