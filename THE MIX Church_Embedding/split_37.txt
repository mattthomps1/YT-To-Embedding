[Music] John chapter 10. this is the scripture that we're coming from the passage today in John chapter 10. one of my favorite scriptures of all time it is the scripture in which God placed in my heart as we were building the mix and as God allowed for us to continue to see the work of this church move forward there was something that I believed I I said this to myself I said there is no possible way that I come into relationship with Jesus Christ and stay the way that I am I said there's absolutely no way you're telling me that our God our savior our Lord our King is coming into my life breaking up Darkness putting me into a place that I've never seen before he's opening up my sight he's restoring my life and I'm just supposed to live so so this is the scripture that I said if we're going to have a relationship with Jesus Christ we're going to have something that's greater than Sunday morning service we're going to have a true life a life that he's called the suit John 10 and 10 and it says this says the thief comes only can I can I can I can I make sure you underline that word only the thief comes only somebody say only I want to emphasize only to you why because the enemy is very good at making you believe there are moments where he is speaking truth to you with no underlying precept of trying to destroy your life I want to tell you time that God isn't speaking and you hear the voice of the enemy it it is not truth only comes the scripture lets us know to steal and kill and destroy what does that mean it means that anything that he is using in the world to distract you t
