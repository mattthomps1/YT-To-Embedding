it do what obey christ you got to speak to yourself yep we're going to go over there no we will not what do you mean no we will not we're not going over there well why are we not going over there because we can't handle it well we can't handle it should we never go over there what do you think sometimes you need that moment to talk to yourself here's what i suggest just don't do it while everybody else is around it's hard to define it afterwards you like what were you doing i was having a conversation with myself and what were you doing i was taking my thoughts captive what does that mean i'm not going to let them get far what are far thoughts imaginations the question is what are you doing with your imagination that you need to take captive what are you doing see your imagination isn't always about what's wrong your imagination is when you wander off with your own will i'm just gonna go over here we're gonna do this i know they called me to do that over there but i'm gonna go over here and we're gonna do this and i think this would be more profitable no that's what you need to take captive even though i'm getting the praises of men and women i'm gonna stay positioned right where god has me to be positioned because i understand it's more important for me to be in my purpose than for me to be following after people's opinions why is that so important because jesus understood that john chapter 6 verse 15 says and jesus realized that they would try to force him to be their king so he went up on a mountain where he could be alone sometimes we're motivated into areas and seasons
