 who's cooking the broken nature is if you can't cook [Music] you're not gonna kill me mm-hmm i'm gonna kill me i'm a cook here's the reason because we think roles are gender-based so we walk into it saying you know well you know you don't do that and it's like why not yeah real quick don't tell her i said this is this live this one is this camera on listen i i told i told my wife i got 13 years you ain't got none so how how's y'all know so i told my wife and them when i started i planted the sea like i'm gonna throw the trash i take the trash out right if i know how to go i take the trash out i will come home we have a drawer trash i know about that so in the cabinet the trash is in the drawer when i go to open the drawer all kinds of things start falling out because the role is oh you take that trash out i don't take that trash out i said to myself it's overflowing we can't even pick it up out of it why because that's your role here's the problem roles aren't about right and role wrong roles become so much about preference you need to know the difference between preference and the difference between right and wrong your preference is that the bed is made up but it is not right or wrong look at y'all i don't know about that man i don't know i don't know about that bastard like i don't know about that uh oh oh no his clothes are on the floor you like it being nice and neat or her clothes are on the floor and you like it being nice and neat and what happens you get into a what straight up argument if all you would do is just pick up the clothes behind you we would be great y
