s agreed to betray jesus come in come in and give him over to the religious leaders for some money jesus was in a garden praying and judas showed the man who jesus was jesus was arrested and taken to the rulers of the land so that they could decide what to do with him jesus was presented before the high council and they asked him if he was the messiah the savior of the jews they asked him if he was claiming to be the son of god you say that i am and the council was furious and they shouted that jesus was guilty and he deserves to die so they took jesus before the roman ruler pilate and he heard the case against jesus pilate didn't think that jesus had done anything wrong huh seemed okay to me they found him to be innocent so pilate said that he would punish jesus and then release him but the crowd kept screaming louder and louder crucify him we want him dead and because of the pressure of the crowd pilate turned jesus over to the roman soldiers to be crucified jesus was hurt and spit on his clothes were torn and taken from him and a crown made out of thorns was put on his head he was beaten so badly that he could barely stand on his own and then he was forced to carry his cross so far up a mountain that he needed help because he could not do it on his own [Music] once jesus made it to the place where he would be crucified called the skull the soldiers around him nailed him to the cross and waited for him to die while jesus was hanging on the cross many people shouted to him if you really are the son of god save yourself from the cross but jesus knew he had to die to forgive
