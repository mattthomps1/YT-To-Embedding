 took her good girlfriend with the these they could have been talking chopping it up talking about what's happening in the town something right but she goes to this wow alone on purpose she was avoiding something drawing water alone in the heat of the day could only indicate one thing that she was a social outcast have you ever been there have you ever been so extreme that at avoiding something that you look back at it today and be like why did i even ever do that like i i know i have one of the things that happened to me was that um in church right we all we talk about church hurt and things like that and so one thing that i can remember was somebody saying something to me and they're ignorant that changed my perception of god right i walked away from the church i walked away from god because i equated god to man i didn't separate god being god and man being man can i tell you that we all have imperfections even in church that we're all still on a journey and that we should never ever ever ever equate the god the lord our creator to man his creation it doesn't add up and so i look back at that moment as you know you grow in your relationship with christ and and you mature and you're really just trying to figure out like what is that thing to make me do to make me do this or what happened to make me do that and that was the very moment that thing right there but but i look back at it now and i say to myself i only walked away because i didn't know any better because i didn't have the kind of relationship that i needed with god at that moment you know the kind of relationshi
