 let me tell you whatever it is you didn't just jump in it that thing was working from the beginning of when you started and god is so good at at delivering us he says listen i got to get the root i got to get the all of that mess out of you that you think is a part of your life and your past i got to help you see it differently but here's what i got to do i've got to correct your truth because in the world today we all have our own truths got the truth about the way i see myself got the truth a bit about the way i call myself i got the truth about the way i want you to see me i got the truth about the way that i believe i have my own truth about what god's word says for me and the problem is is we're comparing our truths with god's truth not knowing that the right truth can do something for you what can a right truth the bible says in john chapter 8 verse 31 through 32 so jesus said to the jews who have believed in him if you abide in my somebody say my word cool you got to have my word because if you abide in it then you're truly my what i can't tell you if you're a disciple or not but jesus said i can he said if you abide in my word you're truly my disciples and if you're truly my disciples then you'll know the what the truth and as you know the truth the truth will do what there we go no freedom it's because of lack of truth a lack of truth is because of a lack of following a lack of following is because of lack of word they're all correlated pastor we just out here feeling doing our own thing you're probably avoiding the word because if so the word will bring truth and
