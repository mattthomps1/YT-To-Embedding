ire is to him not our own will a decision keeps you focused not on what you want but on what you need i made a decision i was going to get healthy so i'm focusing my desires on the need not the want our question today is what have you decided what have you decided with god what what did you and god come to a conclusion with god the days that i have that are number i'm going to spend them being free and happy god says i'm not sure that was the purpose that i called you to there's joy in it but i would have never wrote the scripture that i'll provide peace even where it doesn't seem like it makes sense because if so if my job was to live out every day feeling great and feeling perfect you would never have understood the pain that i go through myself see jesus is trying to make sure you understand he said if if i went through it why don't you think you would go through it today i'm trying to figure out are you willing to walk through the pain to see the product of what god has for your life well is it the pain always no does it feel like it maybe sometimes but the reward of what you see is what we saw in scripture last week which says well done thy good and faithful servant which means i was being obedient to something other than my desires point number one i want to establish for you how to manage the time god has given you so some of us aren't just wasting time around we just aren't living day to day trying to figure out what we're going to do here's what i also want to keep you from is being religious in the way you live your life because you have a good schedule does it me
