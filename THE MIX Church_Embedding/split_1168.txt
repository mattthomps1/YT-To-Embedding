s us know to those in whom we go through the scriptures to those into whom i'll read it in this version is that yet to all who did receive him to those who believe in his name he gave the bible there's one version that says the power to become the children of god it's not going to be up there i'm sorry but it's john chapter 1 verse 12 verse 13 it says children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husband's will but born of god and it says so there's an authority you're given the right you're given the power to be called sons and children of god i'm a son and child of god but when we get to acts chapter 8 he says you shall receive power a different kind of power in the translation of greek which is dynamous somebody say didymus i was like uh i'm not speaking no greek i don't know what that is did in this power that's where we get the word dynamic from it means a power that's not just for the salvation sake of ownership in the kingdom it's power that is bestowed upon us denim as dynamite power to live out and to be everything that god has called for us to be to break the yokes of bondage the yokes of addiction the oaks of sexual identity challenges the oaks of sexual areas in our life that we find ourselves wrapped up in he says this i want to give you the holy spirit because in your transformation you cannot do it of yourself but i'm calling you to have the spirit of the living god so it's not about being better then it's about the operating of the holy spirit on the inside that's what changes me not the mindset that i'm better it's the holy spirit who know
