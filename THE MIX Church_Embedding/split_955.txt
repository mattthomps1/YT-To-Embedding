 my idea is i live for the spirit not the flesh for those that live by the flesh shall not inherit the kingdom of god i don't want you to leave out of here with a false gospel an unbiblical truth and you're thinking this thing of it's just gonna be i love jesus and he loves me for the bible says those who love the lord he says you'll be obedient to my words so i want to clarify for you biblically we are not living in a loved one relationship that does not have requirements if that was jesus you know jesus loved jesus said his love is understood when you become obedient to his love and it becomes greater than your fleshly feelings it becomes about what we do in the spirit of god so when you live out of that joy you can hear a cancer report and still be able to encourage someone else because it's not dependent on how you feel it's dependent on who you know and who you know tells you what is and because he declares what is i can speak those things that are not as though they are i'm victorious are you why because i'm holding to this great hope and so i don't have to be depressed over every bad news i don't have my mold to change because things don't go the way i want them to i don't have to go into a depression because things are not going the way i want i can still maintain my joy [Applause] how do you smile i made the decision to choose joy not opt for joy i'm choosing it what you gonna do today i'm choosing to make a move i'm choosing to walk in his way i'm choosing to look at his path i'm choosing to deny my flesh i'm choosing that he is the way the truth and the life i am
