at john 10 and 10. for the bible says the thief comes to steal kill and destroy and we're thinking physical life and we're thinking that the enemy is coming to steal kill and destroy and take away everything we have he says no no i just want to destroy your purpose because if i can put you in a template like everybody else and you can follow like everybody else does then you have no impact you make no difference you stay like everybody else you do what everyone else does and you don't have the impact in the world that you're supposed to have so he says i'll just kill still and destroy your identity kill still and destroy your identity you'll be like everybody else and you'll do what everybody else does and you'll get in relationships like everybody else does and you'll fall like everybody else does and you'll sin like everybody else does and you'll stay in a broken mindset like everybody else does and you'll do the bare minimum like everyone else does and you'll flash your paycheck like everyone else does and you'll get a car that you can't afford like everyone else does and you'll get a house that you can't afford like everyone else does and you'll get in this process of living out life and the problem of it is is that you get nowhere only in the eyes of people where they're not impressed and god said you are called to be impressive if you could just be you [Music] [Applause] but the problem is you look like everybody else you do what everybody else does and he said i need some people i need some men who understand the signs of the time [Applause] i need some men and women
