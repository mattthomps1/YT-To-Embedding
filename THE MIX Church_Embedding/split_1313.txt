t you you were trying to get here on time but somebody hindered you i'm not going to say it was your spouse or your children but i want to let you know today that the lord is still with you regardless of what you said i'm here to tell you today that the lord is with us david said the lord of hosts is with us he said the god of jacob is our refuge today and i want to talk about that how he is our refuge we're going to read in luke chapter 15 verse 17 through 24 and preceding this the scripture talks about a son a son and a father a son who had an inheritance that was to be given to him upon the death of his father an inheritance is not something that you are supposed to receive until the person that has left it to you passes away in this scripture context that we're going to read the son has come to the father and what he has done is asking him to receive his inheritance early because he believes that he is owed and do something because he is the son of a rich man the bible lets us know that this father grants the wish of his son and the son goes out into the world to enjoy himself the bible says that after enjoying himself he ran out of money and when he ran out of money it said that everybody left him all the people he thought were his friends his boys his homies everyone that wanted him for what he had the bible said they left him and things got so tough that the son became enslaved to a man of the country the man of the country put him in charge of his pigs the problem is is that this was a young jewish boy and this young jewish boy had an issue with pigs because accordi
