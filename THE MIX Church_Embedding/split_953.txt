hip let me talk about real quick why you see me in the front losing my mind during praise and worship and real quick why you need to be here at 10 30 and get here on time so that you can experience it because there's something about the building of my faith that happens when i put myself in position for god to speak and move inside of me through our worship so when our worship team begins to minister and you see me moving or dancing it's not because i feel always like it it's because i have an understanding of that god is doing something even in the midst when i don't feel like it he's changing things he's making things he's moving things he's operating in a way so i begin to lift my hands what in expectation god you're doing something more than i could imagine or even think why cause i'm gonna praise you anyhow i learned a long time ago to stop praising him when it gets good and start praising them even in the seasons where it looks bad to lift my hands and get right there you'll see me tap on this stage and i'll tell my worship team i need a little bit more because what i'm going through i need god to move on my behalf i'm not feeling it today i'm not in the right head space but if you could just allow the anointing that's on your life to minister to me right there god can take me where i need to go he can make me who he needs to make me to be and i'll rejuvenate myself because i'll speak to myself like david said get yourself together that's what my worship is about it's not about waiting for a feeling it's not about for this pansy relationship that you do on sundays whe
