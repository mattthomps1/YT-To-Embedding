 know if you've gotten comfortable like i have i don't know if you found yourself in a place where where just this time that kovit has brought us to has has just put us in somewhat of an awkward position it's stilled us it's rested us it's it's put us into position but the problem is is that some of us it made us lose our passion for life it made us lose the idea of where we were going and what we were doing and and we just got to a place where in this year we were all about changing up things to bring us to a different level of comfort some of us had to change our jobs or jobs in the way in which we did live some of us had to make changes to our finances some of us had to change the way in which we operate with our family and friends some of us had a thanksgiving over zoom some of us had a virtual time with our families and and some of us had really had to uh literally zone in on our health because when things happen in life like covid it changes the way that we do life and life has been different can anybody can attest to that it's it's just been different y'all things are different the way we operate is different we thought we knew people were saying hi to folks that we think we know but we really can't tell who they are because they got a mask on anybody know about that you're just scared to say hello to somebody just you're looking at them and you're staring each other in the eyes it's getting uncomfortable now because that's all you don't have a face to look at it's just an eye moment you're staring people in the eye in the moment because you're saying i know you but
