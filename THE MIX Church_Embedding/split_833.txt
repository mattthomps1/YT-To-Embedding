 we have created a box that so well fits our life and that produces what we want the problem is is once we get there we notice it's not as well as we thought it would be and what he's saying today is I want to do something greater I want us to believe again whether this is you believing for the first time because here's the thing the seed of belief is on the inside of you but the seat of belief must sprout into the plant that has the potential to Bear the fruit that God wants to do within you so that what he does within you is not just about it being for you and what he can exceed beyond what you can think is an ability to make you a world changer but beyond what they ever thought these guys were sitting in the room weeping and crying not knowing they were about to change the world see what you don't know in C that can't come out because fear and interpretation and anxiety and depression keep it at Bay because you believe this is who you are and God is saying I've come to make all things new but because we settle for where we are and we settle for what we want to see we'll just be like I'll take this and God is saying today I have more in store for your life than you've ever thought possible I just need you to be able to tell your neighbor real quick just believe I need you to believe again I need to see a belief to come in you again I need you to stop walking around so fearful and stop walking around so caught in what you think might happen because you're so a fear of death and dirt your life is all about death well I can't do that I can't get I can't go I want to I can't
