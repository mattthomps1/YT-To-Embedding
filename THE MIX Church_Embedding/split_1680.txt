posed to have there is no possession without a fight what god is calling you to it's not without a battle you're not walking into it you're not sliding your way through it you actually have to muster up the faith to believe that god has something more for you even though what he has for you is intimidating it's greater than the resources that i have it's greater than what i have in my bank account it's greater than the amount of people and networking that i've done to give me the influence to be in the space what you must understand about it is that it's already yours the requirement is possession and possession doesn't come without a fight and a fight doesn't come without a battle and a battle doesn't come without some bruises what we're trying to do is fight a fight without any bruises and the problem is is you will get hit but whether you get hit or not it's still yours my question that i ask is why would we allow the enemy to take possession of something that's not his but that god has already declared ours why would we give it to him without a fight because we're scared of some bruises the picture that i want to be able to paint for you in this moment is that some of us are suffering with the spirit of doubt over our life that we don't have the ability to see any further than the things that are offered to us that look like they don't hurt you're trying to find let me talk to someone in here who's in relationship you're trying to find a relationship that doesn't hurt because you were hurt in the relationship before but you can't get into a new relationship without hurt
