cost us a bunch of money and i'm doing this and i'm seeing the money that we had set aside for the project dwindle but can i be honest with you it wasn't enough anyway [Music] so so i'm seeing this happen and so for five six months i'm just asking pastors what do you need what do you need what do you need and then here's what happens in in march of this year i get called by this pastor of new jersey someone that i've just been really looking up to someone that i've been following for a while he just moved into like this 60 000 square foot building getting ready to go into another 40 000 and he's got he's just walking me around sometimes you got to get around people who are listed a little further than you and and so i'm just hanging out with him talking to him long story short at the end of the day we're getting ready to leave and he says hey man i don't know why i don't even know why i'm asking you this but what do you need now i sold what do you need and now here i am reaping what do you need now the problem is that sometimes people are asking that question and you got too much pride to answer that honestly and so i told them well let's define anything that's defined me long story short because he just moved into his building he shut one of his campuses down and in that campus they had video equipment and chairs and lighting boards and sounds and he said man you can have it all you'll never outgive god [Music] and sometimes can i just i'm grossly over time i could probably talk about this for for hours but i really feel so heavy to say that i didn't say this in the first
