you you're a little different you you you're not like everybody else and and you're not all folded in and look like everybody else and trying to be like everybody else there's something different about you but here's the thing if you're placed into a template then you will act accordingly to the template and not according to the purpose and many of us are living out a template life that was set in front of us instead of living out a purpose-filled life that god called for us to live just because the template looks good if the template can provide me a safe and secure job to get me to where i want to be then i stay in the template if the template can produce the ideas that i have in my head there's something about the template that i need if the template is something that my parents taught me then i'll stay within the template the problem is is that the template was not made for you for the bible lets me know you're made in the image and likeness of god and there's something special about who you are but it's easier to stay comfortable and do what everybody else is doing than to find out i've got purpose beyond what i understand and think somebody in here needs to break the template [Applause] and i think the idea of the template is so easy because the template doesn't make me have to consult god it only makes me consult myself if i know the template is to make sure that i go here i go here i go to school i get this degree i come out i do this and this is the way my life ends and then at 60 i retire to enjoy life the problem is is that i think the enemy has been really good
