y bible if you follow me my devotions are consistent but have i come to god have i come to his presence scripture says in matthew 11 28 it says this can y'all do something with me can y'all read it out real quick with me we're going to turn this way all right let's read it together one two three come to me all who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads and i will give you rest action neighbor real quick do you believe it that's his word are you trying to decide now whether you believe him or you're trying to convince yourself that believing in him is enough because if you believe him see here's where church works against us because we believe the activity of attendance circumvents the responsibility of relationship and we set ourselves in position that as long as i come all the things that god promised to me should happen but the problem says you gotta first come to me can we put that scripture back up real quick it says you've got to come to me all who are struggling hard and carrying what heavy loads and i will give you what says it right there says come to me but how many of us are going to go back home and try to fix it ourselves he said come to me you going to your girlfriend he says come to me and you're looking for your parents to fix it he says come to me and you calling your homeboys up and he says come to me all somebody say all all who are struggling hard he didn't say what you're struggling hard with he said all who are struggling hard come to me guess what he didn't say i'm about to prophesy for myself he didn't say come to me because i can't solve it he
