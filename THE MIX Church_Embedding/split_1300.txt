who give you truth then you're in relationship with people that will pacify you i'm gonna hear you out it just don't mean i agree because truth sets you we know it so won't we get it won't you get in a community of people that like you for more than what you look like and what you make your house is nice but i'm not that impressed i'm impressed by you not what you possess jesus loved him but his possessions he didn't care about he wanted his heart so jesus is going to give you that truth even if them feelings get hurt scripture lets us know in jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 through 10 it says this the heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful a puzzle that no one can figure out but i god search the heart and examine the mind i get to the heart of the human i get to the root of things i treat them as they really are not as they pretend to be some of us been pretending for a long time god says i want to free you from pretending you can be you but in being i love this you want all of me i heard people say that before you want all of me i'm like i want go ahead give me all of you but giving me all of you doesn't mean that it deletes the truth that has to come to you your brokenness is keeping you where you are regardless of your anger that you possess that's breaking your heart and guarding your heart regardless of the way that you think that you have made an idol out of because we love to idolize our own thinking regardless of it jesus says the truth if you get it it'll set you free so the clarity is if you're not free you're missing some truth brittany we'd be missing truth you kno
