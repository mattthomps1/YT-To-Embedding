 weren't telling lies they were speaking truths the enemy has spoken some truths it's going to be hard that money ain't gonna come as quick as you think if you make that you have to sacrifice some stuff and you like y'all just hating no no they tell them some truths the problem is though is having the faith to overcome what seems like a negative truth because we can have a truth that has been wrapped in negativity to keep us from fulfilling the call and purpose of what god is speaking know the difference you don't have to call them a hater you just got to recognize they don't understand the spin on what god is going to do yes it's going to cost me yes it's going to be uncomfortable yes i'm not gonna like where i'm going but guess what baby at the end of that thing once you see god work with me the way he works with me when i get back and i show y'all what he's done with me all y'all gonna say truly this is the son of god [Music] you'll get back and you'll say truly yeah it was uncomfortable yeah it did mess up some stuff yes we did have some arguments about it but we still trust in the lord and that's what i'm telling you today you got to trust in the lord and believe that he is able to do more than you could ever imagine or think today
