g joshua was still in the temple worshiping before god see what i've learned is that the lord is always building us to a place so that when it comes time for the season of releasing to your life you can handle what he's releasing without having to give it back or ask for it again my question that i wrote down which was important to me is how's your positioning right now how how well are you positioned for what god wants to answer or are you positioned in a place that if god did say yes you would actually have the ability to do what he's calling you to do the reason why positioning is so important is because when you position yourself you're available for god to do whatever he wants to do now i want to tell you what you're praying for you need to be positioned for what you're praying for you need to be positioned for god i want healing are you taking care of your body for the healing because some of us are asking for healing in areas we're not taking care of lord heal my body lower your blood pressure god heal my body eat better no i want the healing without the preparation which means god says if i heal it it'll get right back to where it is because you haven't positioned yourself for the changes that need to be made so that we can do what god is asking us to do so i would rather do it my way and then ask god to keep coming back to do a miracle instead of working in god's stead for him to do what he's calling to do financially are you positioned to receive increase because you know how to steward what you have it's good why you keep clapping because it's good it's good it's
