r forget she said that over and over I never forget she used to declare that over my life I never forget she used to say it over and I would say I'm not pastoring I don't care what you say I don't care what you tell me we would be in meetings I'm not doing it I told her I'm going on the road to travel so I could be a torn musician leave me out of this I'll help you I'll do whatever is possible I'll give you Direction I'll I'll be a part of everything I'm just not pastoring here's the thing I'm wondering what are you telling God you won't do what's the thing that that the Lord has spoken to you like no that's not me I don't do that let me let me give you my resume God because you don't know my skill sets you don't understand how I operate you know I don't like people I would never do that Lord that just doesn't even make sense you know I don't work that way you know I don't live in that place you know that's not the kind of things that I do and God is saying you don't even know you because what God had done before the foundation of the world was that he had already created you and configured you now what the world does is it disrupts who we are so that we lose the identity of who God's called for us to be but the problem that goes with that is that we begin to accept the identity that sin begins to put a label on us not understanding that what's really inside of us is something greater than we ever could imagine or think and the Bible lets us know that there are greater things inside of us but the problem is it's hard to see because it's buried so deep all of a sudden in 201
