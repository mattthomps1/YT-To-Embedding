 time to give in tell your neighbor real quick this is not the time to give in it's not the time to give in i know what you feel like you need i know what you feel like you feel that you have to have but i want to declare today is that what god has for you is greater than what you believe you need for yourself why was jesus tempted at this point can i tell you jesus was tempted so that he could learn obedience the bible lets us know that as jesus was going to be on his journey he was going to experience some things that were going to come against him to make him try to be disobedient to the father here's what i want to let you know some of the reason that you keep getting tested on your obedience is because you don't understand is that there are going to be some things in your life that are going to try to pull you away from your purpose that god has for your life and if you cannot walk through the temptation that you're in now you won't be able to handle the promotion of the promise that god has given you if you can't overcome the temptation sometimes our temptation is actually a place where if we did yield to it it could bring about results but the problem is is god is more interested in who you're becoming than the end results of what you want to create some of us are like this is the end and if this is the means to the end then i'll justify the actions and the problem is is you cannot justify actions that go against god for broken means it doesn't matter if the end is to help all people if you know the scripture says this he tells jesus turn these stones into loaves why
