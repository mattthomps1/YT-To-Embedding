ing with my life but yet you want to personify something that God says I actually came so you don't have to fake the picture you can live it stop taking snapshots of what you want to be and start becoming who God has called for you to be I was talking to my team yesterday and I was telling them how my wife and I we were on date night and they said we didn't get any pictures I said no because I was actually enjoying myself and I forgot to take some pictures to show you that I was enjoying myself so that you could know I was enjoying myself so you could believe that I was living life more abundantly so I could prove to you through a photo that I captured at the right moment at the right second so that you could believe life was good when I actually saw it in my life that it is good and I don't have to prove it [Music] [Applause] did you have a good time I had a great time why you didn't post it I didn't want to I actually want to enjoy it I will post because they tell me what to do but I will but some of us are only living captured moments and we have been living the most miserable sad complaining broken lives and we get here on Sunday like Lord I give you my heart I give you my I see why you waited down because you have to recreate something that you haven't had all week long and you got to come into a place and put on an act for something that's not actually your life so now church becomes like social media where you gotta actually now come and be a person when you get to church that you're not every other day of the week because you're living out of a broken mentality and
