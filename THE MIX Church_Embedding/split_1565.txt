 i don't know what you know what gospel you preaching i was like i just i just read the scripture just said it right here he says i say to you love your enemies oh oh we going we we ended up real quick he's like love the people that don't love you back love the people that ignore you oh what if you came to church and they didn't speak and you decide to come next week because you weren't easily offended what if i could tell you love wasn't about always being offended and trying to find somebody to put blame on but god was calling you to love just to choose the love what if you were in a place where you could just love today like regardless of like coach did not speak to me when he came in today i looked at him and said hey george he kept going oh oh i got an attitude and when i see him later i'm not going to say nothing to him now i've opted out of the commandment of what god called me to do which is to what love it's no longer a choice you hear the way she talked to you i know but the problem is god commanded me to love god commanded you somebody said command he commanded why are you being so nice because he commanded because it's not an option i don't get to choose if i'm going to do that today god commanded me to love and when god commands me the love i understand what his command is to me today faster they treat you wrong it's not about what they do it's about who he says i am and because he says that i am one who is his son i'll love like he says love today i i want to put you in this place where you stopped choosing because here's what choosing is doing choosing is wei
