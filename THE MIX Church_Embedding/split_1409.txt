 i gotta go get blood work i gotta go test it i gotta i gotta make sure the levels are good i gotta i gotta go and check on it when something goes too fast i got to increase it more so sometimes when that word is is in you but it seems like the enemy is fighting you need a little bit more word you need a little bit more prayer you need a little bit more time of fasting it's not always the same because the levels are always changing it's changing up so i gotta watch it 15 years in i still gotta watch it why because it still can reject it's not a done deal because you've been in church for 10 years it's not a done deal because you're here every sunday it's not a done deal because you know some scriptures it's a done deal because you're deadly looking at it and you're defying all odds and saying i know what i feel but i know what he said [Applause] i know what i feel but i know what he said i know what this looks like but i know what he said i know what they're saying but i know what he said and if we don't pay attention the enemy is very good at making us question what god says in genesis 3 the bible says verse 1 says now the serpent was more crafty can i let you know the enemy is crafty he knows we you've been having a struggle with he knows what what you've been complaining about not necessarily praying about because he gets fearful of prayer he doesn't get fearful of complaints so some of us have been given the enemy too much entry by complaining and not allowing that complaint to be a prayer listen if you're gonna give somebody information then you might as well give them
