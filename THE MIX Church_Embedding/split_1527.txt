re black men from baltimore or they're people charged with legal re-entry and that don't have documentation to be in this country or they're i would have cases with women that were human trafficked right and now we're charged with helping that type of operation but they were victims and they are victims right and figuring out how can i speak to them about life right i'm not to be clear i'm not a counselor that's not who i am but i did feel i had a role and i had an obligation to try and reach them in a way that we can have some hope for the future and some semblance and some thought process about like all right this case will end and it may end with you going home you will go home at some point right what happens when you get home what is the plan what can we do so that you don't have to continue to forfeit and give up time because we don't have a lot of time we have a finite amount of time in this world right we just do and time always say to them time right whether it's years and in the federal system they the sentences are calculated in months which is i don't know why they did that but anyway explaining how many months 96 months is to somebody doesn't make sense that's like when people tell you how old is the baby 18 months okay 12 months okay got it a year and a half you could have said that right got it so 96 months is eight years i know that off top of my head because i have to talk to my clients about that type of stuff but in any event saying those months that you have to spend in you can never get back ever you can get back relationships probably you can get back
