st let me tell you something about that young one you go into a story it's not even like i love it's just you go into a story what about that young one let me tell you something about that young one here every day i'm making a decision cause that one is crazy the context is is that you're saying i'm choosing over what i'm seeing and what i'm feeling that love is still the only option that's available in the situation even though i don't like the space of where it is to be in love and to love is to make two different decisions and when you're saying i'm going to be in love please help me understand how you fell out of it because it's not like something you trip on i fell out of oh how'd you fall out i tripped out it wasn't what it was it wasn't what i thought it would be then you need to know the difference between allowing yourself to get in love meaning into a romantic space with someone without understanding and defining that that love comes with responsibility and if i can say this to us today is that some of us are very irresponsible with our love we're so irresponsible that we give it and take it away according to the way we feel and what we want so now we have hurt people who are in our space because we chose to take our love back because we didn't like the way that it felt but what we did not make the decision is that love is not a feeling love is a what choice so we've got to learn obedience and then second thing is we got to learn forgiveness somebody say forgiveness whoa anybody struggle with forgiveness don't put your hand up do anybody struggle with forgiveness
