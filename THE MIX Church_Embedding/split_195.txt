ldren so that was kind of the three layers it was like work on us work on me work on us work on them and um I thought about when I lose myself when I lose my confidence um when I lose my perspective man sometimes I'm crazy I just lose my mind um I'm thinking about the best way for it to be beneficial to my wife um to our family is for me to work on me and so sometimes we get into relationships we get into uh marriages and we lose ourselves but we're trying to make sure that marriage is stable make sure the children aren't stable and you can't even do that if you aren't where you need to be so just like we can lose ourselves we can lose our confidence we can lose our peace I think just like the woman we need to live literally sometimes put some other things that are are doing well that we know where are there and view at and go and find ourselves go and find our our our our our place of uh peace our place of Joy where we live out of anxiety when we live out of depression where we live out of responsibility I think it was just like one of the big things like man do not lose yourself and did not lose your relationship and don't lose your family so wherever you feel that there is this sense of loss go find it light a lamp you know what I mean sweep the house seek diligently for it and when we work in these areas we will find out that the way in which we um seek after to bring back those lost things whether it's me whether it's uh my relationship whether it's my family um when I do that man I just kind of find myself in a place where I'm back at where I need to be yeah so instea
