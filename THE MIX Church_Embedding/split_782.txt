ely to be selfish than selfless he knew it you would start thinking about yourself more you start thinking about how much more you can do how much more you could have how much more would be beneficial for you how much more you could take it and you would start to forget about the impact of being together instead of the impact of being solo by yourself and that's why the church starts to get destroyed because the idea is is how much can i take and watch out for me then the responsibility of me watching out for my brother whom i'm called to love and the problem with loving my brother is that it means that they're going to be good times and bads and he's trying to teach you what it is to be responsible for each other and not to do what you just want to do [Music] john 3 16 says what god so loved the world that he gave he moved past israel [Music] he moved past those that were just his and it said god so loved the world that he gave his one and only he said now you want to be my disciple this is exactly what i need for you to do give of yourself to people you don't know and people you do know we're like wait a minute and that's what the church forces you to do it forces you to be in communion with other people that don't always benefit you and when you live a life that is about the benefit of yourself you will receive from that seed the same thing what you get is what you've given you give nothing you get nothing he's trying to teach you kingdom way kingdom way is not about you anymore kingdom way is all about him i think we got to unlock the church again i think we got to star
