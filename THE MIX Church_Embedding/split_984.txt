have been holding up your purpose for the last 10 years of your addiction as long as you're in that relationship you're never going to get to the place past where you are so guess what happens when we get stuck in our spiritual life we look for results in our natural life and we try to make things happen that will entertain us enough to keep us going so that we can say we have something going on but the problem with having something going on that isn't your purpose is that eventually you will get bored some of you are only bored because you're not fulfilling your purpose you're making money you've been elevated you're doing what you're doing but the problem is is that you've escaped your purpose so you keep looking for more and more promotions to get you to the place and you're getting frustrated with the world because you want the world to promote you to a place of fulfillment but it can never get you to the place of fulfillment until you start going after your purpose but you got to figure out what's in the way what's in the way that's trying to keep you from purpose you think that money is the answer and god is saying no your healing and your freedom is can i talk to people that have dealt with addiction before oftentimes once you stop using your first thought is let me get a job and stabilize my life and i'm here today to let you know if you cannot stabilize your spirit your life will never come into alignment you can have every job you want what the enemy oh the enemy is so good that he will provide you with enough money to get you back to your addiction [Applause] and
