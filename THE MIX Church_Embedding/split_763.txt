was took out the responsibility of us going through the process of the tabernacle where we had to in order to get into the presence of god you had to offer a sacrifice and in order to offer that sacrifice you had to give it over to a priest and a priest would take it and burn it and walk through a process to take it into the most holies of holies and it made the access to god only for certain people but jesus came who is the great high priest who broke all of the barriers for us to walk through the process of sacrificing an animal which did not have the ability to cover the sins of the world it only had the ability to cover the sins for a time here's what i want to let you know is now we find ourselves at a place where now jesus has come to bring freedom and i want to let you know the bible says we can go boldly before the throne of grace to obtain help in the time of need jesus broke down the walls in order that i could get directly to him today so now the church is accessible [Music] because the high priest is no longer behind the wall the high priest now lives on the inside of me thank god for the holy ghost i can take a praise break right there because what it tells me is is that i have access even when i can't get in touch with pastor even when i can't get in touch with the leader even when i can't get in touch with somebody who seems like they know god i can go on my knees before him and ask him and say father i need you right now in this moment in my life i need you to do something and the bible says he shows up right on time aren't you grateful that you have access
