 I don't have the support [Music] some of you God has removed your support because he needs you to learn to depend on him you're like you got enough money you could fund it it's not my job to do God's job God says this season I need you to learn to trust in me if the finances are going to come it's going to become become I give this word to you today right now it's not happening until you position yourself for God to speak and for God to move [Music] when you come out on the other side you'll get very familiar with the way God moves and when trouble hits you'll start to smile again and say this seems familiar and because you beat it last time you'll know what to do this time and so you start immediately when you feel it sinking which you'll start to do imma give them thanks God right now I thank you God right now I honor you I've seen this before and the enemy's trying to get me all Focus so I know exactly what to do listen you got some people talking in your ear telling you you're the only one that can make it happen you're the only one that can get there you're the only one that can make those things come to pass you have enough money you don't have enough strength you don't have enough intelligence to get to where God wants you to be you must rely on him so instead of complaining how about you just give thanks
