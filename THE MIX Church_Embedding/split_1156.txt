17 verse 7 through 8 it says happy somebody say happy if you're weighted down by what you're trying to get i'm going to promise you today you are trying to be in control for the bible says happy [Music] are those who trust in the lord who rely on the lord they will be like trees planted by the streams the bible says whose roots reach down to the water they won't fear drought when it comes their leaves will remain cream [Music] scripture is saying life hits some of the hardest things will take place you won't see what you prayed for but because you are rooted and grounded [Music] it says they won't fear drought why because the lord of hosts is with them [Music] for the god of jacob that's what david said he's my refuge it says they won't fear drought when it comes and their leaves will remain green i'm not gonna look any different when the enemy comes in like a flood and tries to drown me out and i'll look the same when the spirit of the lord lifts a standard above me and gives me everything i need to be able to walk through the fire and not smell like what i've been through i'm here today to let you know he'll keep your mind in perfect peace those of us who have hearts and minds are stayed on him i'll be rooted i'll be grounded i won't be wavering back and forth and to and fro but i'll stay planted in the word and in the things of god though he slayed me job said yet will i trust him [Music] [Applause] i shall be planted though some things happen in my life i shall be planted [Music] though the enemy tries me i shall be planted take what you want tow it away move it take it
