 order for me to break it i got to give you a season of rest you're telling jesus well i'm lonely and that's the problem the lord says your loneliness your emotions should not dictate to you the plan and the promise that i've already declared over your life because the promise is greater than what you feel in the wilderness if you could just get through it if you could just hold on if you could stop reverting back to us it's a mindset the children of israel said take us back to egypt there we had food there we had water but what your mind forgets is there you were abused you were revoked there you could never walk in your promise stop remembering egypt and your old self as something to glorify and get the understanding that god wants to bring you out of bondage but not only bring you out he wants to transform you but it's if you could understand that you're walking in seasons it's not just the promise it's the process but it's not just the process for the bible says when we are tried we shall come out as pure gold it's also about the promotion i don't want to leave you in the hang that you just go and sit there dry out dark cry and be like lord when am i ever getting out because here's the thing you cannot shorten your wilderness but you can lengthen it some of us are complaining to god because we've been in our process so long but the problem is is god said i i didn't call for it to be that long you weren't supposed to be going for 40 years this was only supposed to take a couple of days when i don't understand my season i don't understand what i need the way i need to be
