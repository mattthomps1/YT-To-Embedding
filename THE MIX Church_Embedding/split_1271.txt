n an opinion changes the foundation changes because i need my foundation to last through some storms some of us the reason that we keep shifting and changing and moving and going is because our foundation is based upon something listen here here's one of the things i have learned and that is coming out and you guys may don't take a look at this often but it's in the christian world is that it's recognizing that christians don't have an understanding of god's word enough to have a foundation that is set on it that's why they will change opinions according to the culture because they don't have a basis on the foundation of the word of god so that's why you get shift shaping christians based on where they are and what they feel and god is saying when you base your foundation on me guess what nothing changes the idea today is do you actually believe you need a makeover anybody ever been there before i think i'm good i'm good i look good i'm good i'm good you think i'm good i'm good so i asked some people are you good i'm good i think i'm good i think i'm real good i think i'm good here's why another reason we think we're good because we've exceeded our own expectations and once you exceed what you thought you were going to do you have nothing else to do i didn't think i was going to graduate i graduate well great well i'm playing for nothing else so we're good we're good yep i'm good yeah this is great i never thought i'd make greater than 50 000 this is great the problem is is when you exceed your expectation you have nothing to look forward to until there's a new expectation
