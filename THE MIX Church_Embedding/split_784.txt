n this season to understand the church isn't isolated acts chapter 2 verse 46 through 47 says this day after day somebody say day after day [Music] that's how we know the church started off pentecostal day after day they met together in the temple they broke bread together in different homes and shared their food happily and freely while praising god everyone liked them [Music] they told me not to say this but i'ma say it it's a possibility and nobody likes you because you haven't opened yourself up to be light [Music] the bible says those who are truly want friendship show themselves what to be what friendly it says this kind of church that was working towards togetherness that was working towards love that was working towards unity it says everyone liked them and each day the lord added to their group others who were being saved let me put my stamp right here your group is the same group for years because nobody is growing and no one wants to come in because you don't have anything to offer but your gift [Music] if somebody was entering into your friendship they would be changing and the bible says they would be saved [Music] i want to challenge you real quick have you made any new friends lately [Music] what that got to do with the pastor here's what i'm asking real quick because my question to you is is have you created such an environment that those around you want to be a part of you and that the world that sees you desires what you have [Music] because you've been called to make a difference and change the world i believe today we are called to unlock the church
