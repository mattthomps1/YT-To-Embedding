 go from here no they had to set up a surgery they had to set up a time where they knocked me out they had to set up a time where i was laying on the table they had to set up a time where i was so out of myself that they could do what they needed to do in me without me interrupting you want to know what romans 12 1 says brothers and sisters therefore i urge you to present yourselves your bodies all of you as a living sacrifice oh sh well what do we do with sacrifices we kill them and open them i don't want to go to the temple because the temple will tell you what you do with the inside you do something with the inside to take it out so the sacrifice is what available to god to do what it says the implanted implanted word uh they knocked me out they cut me open i'm guessing that's what they did because that's what the scar says because when god does work there's a scar that's left because the old you is fighting against the new you so there's gonna be a battle there's gonna be a struggle but you will heal because the old you doesn't have to stay the same way we're on the table they they opened me up and then and man they put the kidney in but here's the thing i think it's so relatable is that they have to wait for the kidney to act and to take let me tell you this just because you're reading god's word doesn't mean it's active it's got to be active on the inside of you that's why the bible says i hide that word in my heart that i might not sin against thee he didn't just say read it but he said hide the word in your heart that you might not say so so so so they have to wait
