ve has to be greater than a feeling love is a [Music] choice we say things like i don't feel the same way i feel about you before what it means is you're not meeting the condition that you used to meet that brought a feeling that no longer the feeling exists the way i want it to feel so now i've attached the feeling with the strength of love but i forgot to understand that love is a choice not a what feeling let's talk about what that looks like we are thinking about love we're thinking about what it is to be loved and so many of us are saying what i need to come from another individual is an emotional construct that stays at a high level to make me feel joyous and happy and to make me feel accepted and to make me feel good about where i am the problem with that is is that when we have not loved ourselves enough we are dependent upon someone else's love to complete us the problem with that is is that mean that you have not been working on what we talked about last week which is your singleness and your singleness as defined as being separate whole and unique is a part that you're supposed to work on for you so that you are not dependent upon someone else's level of chemical balance to be the place where you land daily so that you feel good about you if you had taken the moment and the time and the opportunity to not go find love and to allow love to be a part of who you are then you would understand love is complete in you what through god because what god is love if god completes me and god shows me who love is then that love i can do within myself and i can love who i am
