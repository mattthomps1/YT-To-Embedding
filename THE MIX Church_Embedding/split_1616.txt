[Music] [Music] good morning guys welcome to mix kids we are so happy that you are watching today we are going to talk about being given to the lord last week we learned how hannah prayed to god for a son god answered hannah's prayer and finally gave her a wonderful son that she desired later she said i prayed for this child and the lord has granted me what i asked for of him so now i give him to the lord for his whole life he will be giving over to the lord first samuel 1 27 and 28 samuel then went to the house of the lord at shiloh and worshiped god there with eli the priest today i have a colorful necklace made with fruit loops and a paper cross this will help us to remember to dedicate all areas of our lives to jesus the colored loops can represent some of these areas orange represents friends green represents family purple represents church red represents sports blue represents television and yellow represents school or any other activity you may have dedicating your whole life to the lord means to give the right balance to all areas of your life that is why the colored loops representing these areas are balanced on both sides of the necklace as you wear your necklace these colors will help you to remember to dedicate these areas and give them the right priorities in order to please god for example god would not be pleased if you chose to spend too much time playing with your friends when you should be reading your bible on the other hand god want you to spend time with your friends if it involves sharing jesus with them watching television is okay but it would be much
