going to stop me from looking because something in me gives me a draw to something i've never seen before and there's some things that you promised me that your word says are beyond what i could imagine or think is this a possibility for my life how do you overcome surrounding doubt you silence it the bible says caleb got up and silenced the crowd sometimes you gotta walk it i can't even tell y'all this story yet because it's to come so i'll wait i'll wait on it but i'll tell you a piece of it with very general details [Laughter] but i was at a police looking at a thing all right y'all with me i was at a police looking at a thing as i was looking at the thing a person said to me you know there are some other competing individuals who have a better picture than you i stopped right there i said here's the thing the problem is is they don't have god's promise there was a quick silence you ain't got no clap back for that i was like all right silence sometimes you just need to tell the people around you just i know what god's doing you think you can i got this i know the promise because sometimes if you let it in it'll take root if you let the doubt in if you if you let the confusion in if you let someone just tell you their version of your vision from god they will smear that thing so bad that you won't have a vision and you'll be going back to your bed like did i i don't know maybe i didn't hear from you know what that is a bad idea you know what i'm not even going to look at that no more just forget it you have to silence your surrounding doubters solace it with your actions
