e and he's saying in that choice you have the ability to opt out and god says the problem is is you don't have the ability to opt out it's what i command you to do can i take it totally out of relationships and put it into what we're dealing with in our country which is race can i tell you in the most racially charged climates of the world that god has called for us to love those who do not love us and if we're called to be the mixed church i i think what god is saying is is there something that i want to do in you that only i can do in you that's not about how you feel but it's about the choice that you make it says i'm calling you to love and this is the commandment that i give you love one another as i have loved you so you are to love one another and point number three you must learn to sacrifice i want to tell somebody today you're in a relationship and you're looking for 50 50. and i want to tell you that you're missing what love is can i tell you so many times 50 50 is out the door you're saying pastor well what what what what can i do when it's 50 50 or 75 25 or 100 zero how do i get back god says i'm not calling you to get back i'm not calling for you to recover your missing amount because that's what we do i'm missing a percentage so this valentine's day don't get to give and receive you give because it's who you are would i want to do this valentine's day i want to love well who god called me to love oh oh what about this what what about what about sending a gift to your enemy y'all was like oh no that's that's something different bro that we ain't doing that now
