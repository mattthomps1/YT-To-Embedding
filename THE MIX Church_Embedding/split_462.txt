 today I said yeah I'm doing good how you feeling and I woke up and I said that's what you did you showed yourself to be true by the way you worked yourself in my life not because you changed the way that I feel now but you sustained me kept me and then took me took me over the Bible says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for you are with me so at night when I was sleeping in the enemy thought he was going to win I could just feel the Lord saying I got you don't you worry about this my rod and my staff they'll comfort you through the night they'll watch over you during the day they'll be with you and I said Lord take me through so I can prove of your testimony it's passion all free it's passion Sunday the work of God will go further in this church because of what he's doing in your life how well I can do what I'm doing it's about how well that people can see the testimony of God over your life I believe this today that your position for next just tell your neighbor you're positioned tell your other neighbor you're positioned tell your third choice you are positioned so don't move because God has something in store for you today I believe that can we thank God for the word today [Music]
