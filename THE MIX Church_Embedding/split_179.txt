hem to be instead of fulfilling the call of God on my life so I have a place of Unfinished Business what am I walking around satisfying the desires of the flesh I want to make sure I feel good I want to make sure I do what I want to do I want to make sure it's the amount of money I want to make it's the job where I want to be it's the thing I want to do and the problem is is that trauma keeps me from being obedient because obedience in my life was always an impact of someone doing something against me that I did didn't like so now trauma is my new normal and now I cover it up through my words like well you know I don't like people well some of your trauma doesn't have you close to people because you haven't really experienced love properly a love child and a love individual has the ability to give back love because that means they've been filled and taught and given the ability to understand how it works what we have done is really put to our Brokenness and excuse and so the trauma we live out from church hurt from household some of us are dealing with the trauma of being adopted or foster care and we have lost the place where we don't have an identity anymore and so now you're trying to define it look at my life I'm like hey what's going on yeah yeah yeah hey you want to do this no I don't do that why I don't even have a reason for why can I can I tell you for everything you say you don't do tell me what's its origin why don't you do people because of what your emotions is what what's attached we love to excuse our lives without reason oh this is just how I am it's not how
