back and forth y'all because the idea is oftentimes is that once i become a christian everything becomes perfect in the way that i do life i can't have any issues i don't have any struggles i don't have any areas that come against me i'm not fighting against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places once i got god everything becomes perfect i want to let you know that's not how it works life hits and it becomes real and it tires you out and it steals your joy and it makes you think why am i continuing and you remember at the end of the day the lord is with me i want to tell you today that the lord is with you you may be frustrated in this moment but the lord is with you you may be thinking about quitting in this moment but the lord is with you i got to the end of the nine holes thank god it wasn't 18. i can tell you right now i wouldn't have made it can i can i tell some of you that you're praying for more holes than you can handle can can i speak to somebody today to to let you know that you're trying to play a golf game and you can't handle what god is even saying right now and you're praying for more things than you can actually be able to handle you you you really can't grasp behold you think because you heard a good word that the enemy is going to be light on you i'm here today to let you know you you got to you got to play nine holes before you can go and try to do 18. you got to process your way through you got to learn your way through it so i got the whole nine and i just said to myself thank you god that i finished and that i didn't quit some of you y
