 don't feel as confident about myself as god has seen in the way he created me and the way that god created you is greater than what you think about yourself you are god's creation you are the bible says ephesians 2 and 10. you are a masterpiece created in christ jesus to do good work but if you could be honest most of the time i don't always get to see myself in masterpiece form i see myself as a copycat i can see myself as not an original but something that has been mocked off i can see myself as an idea or something being copied but i want to let you know today you are i heard the song say a designer's original you are one of a kind there's something special about you i just want you to look at your hand real quick everybody just put your hand up to your face and i want you to look at it there is nobody else that has a fingerprint like yours you are unique [Applause] but if you looked at yourself in life oftentimes you you would lose joy because your uniqueness you would say still doesn't define the great things that i want to happen in my life and god is saying today what i want to let you know is that you'll never define that unique joy that's on the inside of you if you look for it to be pleased by the desires of your flesh somebody say flesh now you got to say it with disgust flesh because if you don't get that disgust with your flesh what i'm trying to tell you is is that you will look to create opportunities for your flesh to be pleased some of y'all right now think about brunch why because you're hungry pastor i ain't eat today so make sure you wrap it up on time
