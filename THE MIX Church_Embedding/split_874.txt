 reason so it's important that the people around you be established because there's something they're supposed to add to your life not take away [Applause] [Music] when you get 12 homies around you [Music] you got to be on them and what you doing today man i'm chilling we ain't got time to chill y'all let me let me let me tell you real quick let me establish why this is so important because if you understood how important the surrounding that you have in your life is you will pressure the people that are around you to become everything that god has called for them to be because they're in your life to establish a blessing that god already has over their life and you're in their life to establish a blessing that god has over their life and if we join together where the bible says two or three are gathering together touching and agreeing do you know what we could conquer as a unit together and not by ourselves it could be something that would blow our minds but the fact of the matter is that i don't value what god has put inside of you enough to establish some confidence in you to say you better get it together because if you don't get it together i can't get it together because i'm depending on you and you depending on me and i can't go backwards so man up woman out and get your life right because my freedom is on the line if you're tempted and i don't have any accountability where am i going [Applause] what we're establishing is how important your salvation your circle and the purpose of what god has placed inside of you what it means to your growth and your further movemen
