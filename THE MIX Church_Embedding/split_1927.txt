e way that you sow the way that you expect is the way that you create in time management so if i'm expecting y'all remember that song i'm looking for a miracle you remember that you ever heard that may not have heard it okay it's cool i just introduced you to it all right you're looking for a miracle great anybody need a miracle can somebody be honest anybody need a miracle i need a miracle y'all need one i need one amen i need a miracle great how much time you spending with god to get it i think i mean i think he just knew so i figured if he knew he would just do it oh you're not willing to invest the time into the relationship with god but you're looking to reap the miracle you you want the blessing you want the house to open up you you want the husband you you want the promotion you just don't want to spend the time with god got it just asking because i'm interested in your mind of what you think is a product of what you do so if you think god owes me a miracle then you operate at the level that god says you know what i'm going to wait for you to act and you're saying on the other side no god i think you owe me and act yourself do for me and i'll come for you and god says that's not how this thing works so the context is how do i manage my time here's what i believe god works with decisions and desires do you have a decision and has it created a desire my decision is this i'm going to follow god to where he's called me all throughout scripture god has led people with vision he has spoken to them of clarity of where they're going abraham go i'm gonna make you a father ove
