 the one who started this journey of faith and he is the one who completes the Journey of Faith it says as Jesus Paid no attention to The Shame of the cross he suffered there because of the joy he was looking forward to then he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God here's what I want to tell you is that in your Journey of Faith a journey implies changes transitions challenges Adventures and I'm sure that you desire Comfort right now but for the next phase of where you're going you're going to have to trust God which means you're going to have to be uncomfortable which means it's not going to feel like you wanted to feel Point number two that's we're learning and Gathering faith for the journey we got to have courage for the fight I remember when I got to high school and I'm going to share this this is great um story about myself I can put myself out there I decide that my wife says often I put her and the rest of my family out there so I'll put myself out there today I went to a school it was a school that my mom pulled me out of the the Catholic school that I went to in the city and I went out to a county school and it was far out it was out in Towson and you know when I got out there I was the only kid African-American kid in my grade and so I got there and I wasn't nervous about the space but I was nervous about the surrounding I had never been in this kind of surrounding before and I never forget growing and learning and I mean just having so many different friends and it was a life-changing moment for me and then I left that school and went to another school
