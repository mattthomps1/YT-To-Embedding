 and what i'm trying to do is tell you to put value in the things that matter pastor you love your life i love my life because i know i chose some things and i weren't i wasn't comfortable with and i'm okay with that because there's still fulfillment even when things aren't perfect see that's the difference in walking and purpose is that purpose even in uncomfortable still is fulfilling that's a little challenging ain't it your process is pronounced psalms 22 7-8 says all who seek me mock me this is david he said they hurl insults shaking their heads he trusts in the lord they say let the lord rescue him let him deliver him since he delights in him somebody said we're just going to leave you to yourself we're going to leave you to your jesus your jesus ways you're holier than thou art you'd be like well leave it to me then because i'm willing to risk it all on god then risk it on you can i tell you in process you need to be so concerned about your destiny that you don't mind offending some of you god has called for you to be a leader right and you're like i'm just going to wait and buy my time when you really need to be trying to do everything to do to get into position where god's called for you to get to i'ma say this some of us are way too lacks with our destiny when god called me to pastor i was in people's faces who hadn't they have nothing to do with me they didn't want anything to do with me they weren't trying to do anything guess what i was telling them i don't care because god's called me to be in this moment and if i don't get this moment then the next moment won
