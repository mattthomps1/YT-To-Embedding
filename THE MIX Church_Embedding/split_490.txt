e a paycheck coming that week after I'm here today to let somebody know that God's calling for you to sow and I'm here to tell you you will not see the Harvest in two weeks but there is a harvest and the Bible says this be not weary in your well-doing for in due season you will reap a harvest if you faint not God is calling for you to do something now that right at the age of when you're about to faint he is going to blow your mind and I'm believing that today I believe each and every person in here you were created for next and God wants to do something more than you could ever imagine think
