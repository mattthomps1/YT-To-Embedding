 bible says he's as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he is every day looking for you he is every day watching after you've got to say i've got the victory today when i hit that alexa i be like alexa shut up stop hitting that alarm but i need alexa to tell me back just remember though you've got the victory today if you got to set that as an alarm if you got to set that as a quote you need something you got the victory today okay i need to know that because the way i'm feeling when i woke up the restlessness that i had all through the night the things that were on my heart as i was sweating in the bed the way that the enemy was tossing and turning my mind i don't feel like i have the victory but i need to wake up and know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world whatever i'm facing today i got this thing baby whatever i'm facing today i'm built for this thing baby whatever is coming my way i've got the victory why are you so pumped because i've been walking in victory every day 365 days saying god is good and greater is he that is in me and when i'm walking and guess what i'm walking with my head held high because i'm victorious [Music] i'm victorious daily they don't take all that it does it takes that and more scripture lets us know ii corinthians i feel like it was a testimony of mine but it says it is true that i am an ordinary weak human being but the difference between what you may do at times and what i do is that i don't use human plans and methods to win my battle it's not about how great i am it's about greater that is he that's in me
