one and you're bored and you're sleeping because you don't have vision can see ideas are short-lived and ideas can be accomplished by you without god if you have all the pieces to the puzzle that means your idea is from you but if you've got a vision that you have no clarity and understanding about the resources and where it's coming from if you don't have a vision about i don't know how i'm going to get my family from out of this place and to a new place if you have no vision for your marriage if you have no vision for your household you can see no further than the next step because vision is from god and vision is for the world some of us just love having ideas good ideas guess what happens when men tell me ideas i don't get excited pass them and build the business all right it's fine but where's the vision i'ma have 10 employees sorry what's the vision because the vision impacts the world tell me its impact not its resources because the 10 people that you want on staff are only resources to fulfill the vision if you don't have the vision the bible says without a vision people what perish real quick some of us are perishing while we're living can we have a good time in here charles just maybe you mean you know what i mean like when connected if you if you don't have a vision then you don't have anything to wake up to because an idea you can easily throw away because ideas sometimes work and don't work a vision is not about it working a vision is about having the resources that god has for your life to see it come to pass visions come to pass ideas happen so my question is
