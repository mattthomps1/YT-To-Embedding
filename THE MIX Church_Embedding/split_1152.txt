ise comes and means are you ready let's go he's like process you like you know what i'm done i'm done i'm not doing this some of you i want to be honest with you you come closer to jesus and it seems like things get worse won't admit that yeah like don't talk about jesus like that he is nice but the truth of the matter is you know why things happen so fast when you get saved because he's been waiting to start the process it's crazy at it you thought getting with jesus was about him doing what you wanted and he's got to get you out of your pride so he starts process real fast you're like lord i give you my heart cool you lost your job what the oh my god he's like i was trying to get you out of it anyway but you ain't hearing me so now you're giving your heart to me let's start the process and you're like this christian thing ain't working but nobody told you there was promise there was process and there was promotion and god starts quick and early and you're like i didn't mean no i'm not going to that church no more they lied no no no i didn't lie because there was a promise that in you knowing the truth that the truth would set you free but in order for the setting free to take place there's got to be a wilderness that you walk through where god is throwing truth at your life and you're ready to be able to accept it because in the acceptance can come change [Applause] and the whole time you thought god was against you he was like oh no i'm just ready to get you to who you were supposed to be often times we're wondering out about our purpose without caring about our process
