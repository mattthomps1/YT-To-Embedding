 calling for us to live through and live out is in this moment in presence and understanding lord whatever you have for me to do i am willing to do it now i believe this the more you step out is the more you'll see god's hand move it doesn't matter if you start drowning because as soon as you call on the name of the lord the bible says immediately he'll save you so there is a risk in your faith [Music] you're like i want no risk i'm like well then stay there because your salvation can be sealed but the problem is without faith it's impossible to please god so you're going to have to come back to a place of faith where you start trusting god for that which is not seen and i speak this over your life today i believe you could see god do incredible things if you would stop consulting with the eleven here's what i know is true yes is scary yes that's crazy yes i wouldn't do it everything they probably were saying and thinking was actually probably true real quick every person that gives you a reality check is not speaking lies that's right we love to create haters for the sake of our comfort because we have the idea that we can do everything you can do all things through christ so some things that people are saying are actually truths we don't like that no no because they they telling me wrong no they're telling you right but the problem is is that your faith has to overcome even that truth you remember when the 12 spies walked into canaan they weren't speaking lies they were speaking truths there's giants in the land they're the americas they're the amorites there was not they
