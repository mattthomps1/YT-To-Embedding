e people who are talking i'm only talking to the people who are talking talking let me give you real quick the stages of your singleness there is by yourself there is talking there is talking talking there's engaged there's betrothed there's marriage there's a lot of statements in there of what life looks like why because the idea is that you grow an understanding of each other not in feeling can i tell somebody single before you go date somebody else again that stop being so concerned about how bubbly you feel in the moment and start asking some complete questions that help you to identify what god would fit and see fit to give you as a what partner what god would introduce into your life and stop getting frustrated at me because i can't make them who you want them to be so you can be beyonce and jay-z and that brother and sister ain't got no intentions of being nobody's beyonce or jay-z because marriage doesn't fix it us us but it doesn't fix us and if we are not working on our singleness being separate whole and unique in god then what we are getting is an incomplete individual who we are hoping will turn out to all of the things that have been ticking in our wonderful minds of who that special person was going to turn on and be so let's talk about which box you're going check let's talk about where you're really going to find yourself being because now you're understanding your singleness is not a curse your singleness is not a a response from god that you don't deserve the bible says that god had to create eve to be fit for adam yet and still eve jacked up the process
