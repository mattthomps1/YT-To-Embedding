lk about jesus i think he's a good subject to talk about preach something we preach jesus the bible says his meaning jesus his parents went to jerusalem verse 41 of luke chapter two and says every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem according to the custom of the feast now when they had finished the days as they returned it said the boy jesus and luke is being respectful in using this word it says he lingered we're going to come back to that word a choice of verbiage he lingered behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother did not know it we're going to talk about their parenting skills as well but supposing him to happen in the company they went a day's journey a day's journey and sought him among their relatives and acquaintances so they did not find him they returned to jerusalem seeking him now so it was after three days somebody say three days it's something about jesus in him three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both listening to them and asking them questions and all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers it says so when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said to him son why have you done this to us look at your father and i have sought you anxiously if he could have been god in that moment acting he'd have said there's a scripture that's going to tell you be anxious for nothing but he didn't act that way he just went ahead and heard what they were saying it says and he said to them why did you seek me jesus watch your tone all right watch y
