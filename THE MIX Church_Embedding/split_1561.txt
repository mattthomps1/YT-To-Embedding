sometimes anybody knows what that feels like anybody ever gets so mad i mean so mad so mad like so mad that you find yourself in the place where you're just like i can't forgive it and i'm not even gonna be able to release it and the enemy's like great because i got a hold on you because here's what scripture says because the enemy knows scripture he says basically if you can't forgive then guess what your father in heaven won't forgive you he's like so good you'll live in unforgiveness and you'll live broken so long that you'll stay where you are and you'll never become who god's called for you to be and i don't want you to learn how to forgive a person i want you to learn the what forgiveness as a way of living not in action to do because some of us are choosing who to forgive and we're choosing who not to forgive and if we go back to scripture scripture says what you're to love what your enemies you got some people in your life that you've got to learn to love that are your enemies and the only reason they're your enemies now is because you all aren't in the same agreement with where you are but the problem is is you were you loved them before but now they're your enemies today and god is saying well how did you fall out of love and we get it messed up because we're thinking in love romantically and god is saying no i call for you to love the kind of love that i'm calling is the agape love because of the holy spirit that runs in you that gives you the ability to forgive well what is forgiveness ephesians 4 32 it says what be kind and helpful to one another oh tenderheart
