e right now and the greatest that you see of yourself is what you have accomplished in your past but i'm here today to let you know is that as david wrote there was something that god was doing in the secret before the time were even put together before the earth was even created he was thinking about you he was forming you in the secret places he was hiding you behind the veil making sure that as he created you there was something unique and special to your designer he didn't let the angels know about you he didn't let the earth know about you yet he said because i'm working on something special here's what i want to declare over your life today you are something special that god has been working on before the foundation of the world and he has just been waiting to release you in your right season so that you can see every area of your life blossom according to the purpose he said over your life i gotta preach this to you today because if you don't believe in you then you will fall at the wayside and every morning you wake up you'll have a complaint in your heart and you won't have a praise unto god why because when life has no purpose it sucks [Music] you wake up every morning looking for something to motivate you but the problem is is that within us we don't always have the encouragement to motivate ourselves and god is saying i need you to have something greater in your life than what you think will be in your bank account what you think you will drive what you think you will live in it needs to be a greater aspiration to your life than the things that you have he's say
