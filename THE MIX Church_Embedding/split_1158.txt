ecause you've become god for yourself thinking you have the answers and thinking you know the way and the lord is saying today i want you to take my yoke he didn't say you won't have a yoke and he didn't say you won't have a burden he said but my yoke is easy and my burdens are light so whatever it is you're fighting through whatever it is you're going through it's not that i stop what you're going through but i give you a place so that you can be happy because you're trusting in me he says they won't be stressed in the time [Music] he says and even when you're at your hardest place when you don't think you have anything to give god says the evidence that i'm with you is that you won't be stressed in the time of drought [Music] or you won't fail to bear fruit god is still going to do something even in the seasons where you feel all strength is gone [Music] he says you'll still bear fruit you'll still impact people you'll still give you'll still change lives when he's taking things away you'll still give that's the impact that looks so different it's when things are coming from me that i'm still yet giving things [Music] see we love to be generous when we have plenty [Music] but jesus says the wilderness and process that i'm taking you through it's going to make you into such a different person that when you come out even when it doesn't look the same when the account is not the same you're still going to be trying to figure out how do i give more how do i help more how do i do more how do i impact more [Music] because he says when i'm in you there'll be something happy beca
