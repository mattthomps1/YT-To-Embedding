believe that because i believe that when god is doing something in your life people are coming to ra around to see what the lord is doing and we're trusting that i want to tell you real quick next week you want to be in the house next week is baptisms y'all uh are you happy we're celebrating people coming to know jesus and making that our decision and making the commitment to know who he is listen as the church that's one of our number one responsibilities is to lead people to know who jesus is and so we're excited every month every fourth sunday when we see people going down in the name of jesus christ and also on next week in the middle of your fasting time in the middle of uh our time of what we're doing 21 days of prayer and fasting we're having a night of worship a night of worship is an opportunity to really understand that god wants to do something even greater he wants to speak even louder and louder doesn't mean in noise it means that he's cancelling out the distractions and those things that are around you that keep you from hearing his voice and worship night gives us an opportunity to sink deeper into the presence of god so you want to join us next sunday at 5 30. uh there is a worship and a word that god has for us in this house and i'm believing that and then in the next two to three weeks you want to be looking out because mixed groups are starting and we're excited about that we believe in community we believe in the culture of community we believe in understanding what god's word says for us and as we follow the word of god we will see him change our life g
