 you really mean no he made a statement i'm here today to ask you in this moment as you're getting on course and jesus has declared what he is asking for you to do do you only get on course once you know where the finish line is or are you willing to get on course and learn where the finish line is when he gets you there too many times we're only willing to follow and to go as long as we have everything that satisfies us and guess what i'm here today to let you know some of our callings are on the line because we're not willing to follow god and not know where he's taking us i'm gonna tell you some of you today yeah you're supposed to be a business owner the problem is is that you're not willing to step out there on your own and allow god to take you in direction so guess what you settle for where you are and god can't take you any further to where you need to be and you're settling outside of your purpose and your call god's calling for you to do that god's calling you to be a mentor god's calling for you to develop an idea that will go global but the problem is is that he can't shore up your future by you knowing it without a yes so you need to make a decision and get on course and sometimes can i be honest you're going to ask where is this taking me and guess what you're going to hear silence where we going jesus where we going are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet and you won't hear anything anybody knows if you if you're a really really good parent you know not to answer back too quickly because the back and forth will easily irritate you are we there yet
