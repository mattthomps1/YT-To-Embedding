 have destined for your life and call for you has to actually happen because i'm a god of my word that's why you can't send your way out of your anointing and your blessing why because what god is destined for you is for you you're talking about what you messed up how much you messed up who you mess up with and god is saying all i need you to do is get in alignment and when you get an alignment it don't matter how much you doubt it it doesn't matter how much you talked about it it doesn't matter how much you want to even go back to egypt i'm letting you know that destiny is still awaiting you your hope is not in vain they got an ability to be able to spy out the land the problem is is that when you spy on the land the wrong way when you walk into something not seeing how you can conquer it but you're walking in to see how it can conquer you there's amla kites there's jebusites there's the annex that are greater than you what you're doing is you're creating within yourself an understanding that even though something has been promised it's still not for you the idea that god would promise them a land hundreds of years ago that he intended for them to have and that he wouldn't bring them to that point they believed that what was in the promise was greater than the promise and what's in the promise or what is trying to keep you from the promise can never keep you from what's already yours because what's already yours has been declared yours the issue about what has already been declared that is yours is that there's always an enemy who is trying to keep you from what you're sup
