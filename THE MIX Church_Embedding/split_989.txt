st temptation you're like this is not bad it's not a bad thing i'm not looking at bad stuff it means like yeah i don't have to trick you with that because because you are so desperate to be good i'll give you good things that are in your purpose cause you are so enamored with wanting to be good i'll give you good things to waste your time and you between yourself won't know any purpose to it but the fact that you think it's a good thing last thing is that temptation is testing your loyalty the bible lets us know the devil he tempted jesus to prove that he was the son of god can i can i tell you today that the enemy is trying to get you to compromise he's trying to put you in a space of compromising he he wants you to compromise in this moment so that you don't have to go through pain that you don't have to feel what it's like to be in other people's he's like no don't go through you don't have to do all that you'll have to do all that if you just what serve me can i tell you today that through your temptation the enemy is oftentimes saying won't you just come and follow me won't won't you just i know how desperate i know the urge it is a part of you people told you that's who you are and the enemy is telling you that's who you are so you got to be who you are and god says you don't even know who you are i created you i formed you in my image and in my likeness stop telling me who you are i'm the one that spoke life and you existed but the enemy is trying to get your loyalty to be on his side and this is what he told jesus said if you listen i'll give you all of this he alwa
