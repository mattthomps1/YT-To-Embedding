says there's an ear in this moment that's cut off it doesn't give who and it doesn't talk about where they came from but we know somebody traveling with jesus is still working out their soul salvation a knife pops up jesus knows all things he let that knife slip in i'm just telling y'all you got to look at the text he lets the knife slip in and the knife comes out slices an ear off it's bloody jesus got people joking him up on one hand he's got blood in the other hand as he's trying to reattach an ear the first evidence of plastic surgery jesus does it the bible lets us know that somebody pulls it out now i'm this is a sidebar the idea is that mark wrote the gospel of mark but mark was not there knowingly as a disciple of jesus so it lets us have an understanding that there's a possibility that mark's account is influenced by a certain disciple a certain ear cutting disciple it's amazing how this person leaves their name out of the situation when this happens i just wanted to give you all that insight real quick you can go back and study that but the context is is that when destiny really comes for you and it interrupts your life and you've really got to act in faith because faith without works is dead and you really have to come to grips with what you were speaking you won't always find that there's a crowd of people around you the bible says in that moment when when jesus jesus had this moment it says that the the disciples it said it didn't even say the disciples it said everybody they fled can i tell you that some of the biggest moments in your life are going to happen
