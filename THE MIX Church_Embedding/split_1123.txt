hould get there pretty soon but when we get into verse 17 the problem is is that jesus is four days late for something that's dead and when jesus is late for something that's dead we stop praying because we forgot he's the resurrection in the life and we think things are dead in our life because god gave us a promise but you forgot that god can fulfill the promise because you thought that according to your level of relationship would be according to the level of how fast god moves here's what i want to let you know you can do your daily devotional you can pray and god still is on his own timing and you might turn to yourself and say well why do all of this is he going to do it on his time anyway because there's something that god does on the inside of you while you're going through process and the time of process gives you the ability to be able to withstand as the bible lets us know be not weary and well doing for in due season ye shall reap a harvest if you think not the problem is is and when i'm not in the process i think every time and i go back to the drawing board of looking at the promise and believing it's the promise even for me and he said if you could just wait and walk through the process i would give you everything you need but the problem is is that we're at an urgency and we've got four days ahead of us and lazarus is dead so jesus will you keep what you said your word you keep your promise the bible says when jesus kids get states see jesus y'all he's something else he all walking in strolling hey what's going on everybody y'all good good to see y'all today
