 connect in and and so i i want to come from an education standpoint i've got my principals here and they uh they are uh making an impact with our young people and one of the first questions that i wanted to hit was is what has been the quality of education for our youth since the start of the pandemic what's some of your concerns what are some of the positive effects like what's happening in our educational system that our church needs to know about and we need to be considering now right so um from the beginning of the pandemic uh you guys know it wasn't something that you know it literally happened overnight wasn't something that anybody was prepared for uh the students weren't prepared for it the parents weren't prepared for it we had to make a lot of adjustments technology was thrust into the lap of everyone students had to learn a different way teachers had to learn how to teach a different way and administrators had to learn to work with both simultaneously and so it created some learning gaps from students that did better um you know virtually but on the majority students did struggle you had students that we used to make straight a's that really struggle in that virtual environment and it just led to some learning gaps there's nothing like getting that in-person instruction for students and when that gap is there um it takes a while for it to come back and so for us we've seen those gaps who try to do different things summer school after school care after school programs those things have worked somewhat but on the whole it's going to take years from this pandemic
