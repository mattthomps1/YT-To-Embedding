the spirit of this world is not the initial spirit that god called us to the bible lets us know in genesis that when he created man and when he created woman he had created a perfect creation that in its creation it was always to operate under the authority of the kingdom of heaven can i tell you today that earth is supposed to reflect heaven and there's supposed to be a reflection between the two but here's where the problem came in is that sin entered into this world and when sin entered into this world sin started to make the decision that it can operate without god and where we've landed at in life is that we have started to believe the world and what it says that we can operate at an autonomy outside of what god says based on how we feel based on what we think based on our opinion based on the thoughts that we have and the lord says you were never supposed to operate outside of me i'ma hit this subject today because in order to get the presence of god in we've got to get the presence of someone else out so we're going to take time with this today because there's something that must be integrated in our spirits and there's something that must be opened up in our minds because the perspective of where we are is that we are still sometimes in the same place we were two and three years ago operating out of the same potential that has not turned into purpose any of us would get frustrated with the seed that has been planted in the seed that has been planted that finds itself in a place where it's not growing we're going to ask the question what is keeping the seed from grow
