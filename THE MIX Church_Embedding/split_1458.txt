hy when things are going so well do you need to take a break because when things are happening so well and god is blessing you the way that you've never seen before you need to take a moment to make sure you are in alignment with what god is doing so one of the first points i need you to do is in an unapologetic way of living you need to get alone you need to get by yourself you need to get into a space where you can hear the voice of god the bible lets us know that jesus sent away his disciples he sent away the crowd he went up to the mountain and the bible says he prayed cannot can i can i tell y'all when when you're getting a little above yourself you need to get humbled let me tell you where the best humbling comes in the presence of god him back she's just humbling you because you said man look look what we just did we just fed 5 000 we we just killed that you see what we you see man how many did you give out you only did 150 man i was killing it i was passing out handing out sandwiches letters and tomatoes adding cheese i was doing all that you don't know where i was and we start thinking the bible says more highly of ourselves than we should and we we start taking credit for the miracles that god did that he placed in our hand to be distributors of oh my god why is that it's so important because the work that god is blessing you in is not of you it's of him he just put it in your hands to distribute the bible says as he as he puts it in their hand they they come into this place and they're acknowledging he sends them away and says i need to regroup can i tell you if
