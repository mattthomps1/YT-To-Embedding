o figure out what other bodies do you need to deal with because people have become one flesh with so many other people you got to figure out what people you're in order to get to the person it's hard no it's hard because the challenge is is you haven't dealt with some of your past so your feelings of insecurity come out of your broken past your your your protected heart comes out of your broken past you didn't deal with it now you got to heal from it problem is we like healing while being relationships i just got out of a relationship oh that's what's up you single right now no i'm just talking to a couple people wait well don't you want to figure out what happened no no no it just ain't work out but real quick y'all weren't like together together were you no because it's only official if it's two you got to be talking talking together together married married or single single you single i'm single single that mean you ain't got nobody in sight like who you live just me and jesus it says the two become one flesh but then he goes and says this but but he who is joining to the lord becomes one spirit with him so if you break the spirit that you have with god it means you don't have an opportunity to be connected with what he's calling and saying for you to do so premarital sex is not about just being obedient to god even though that should be enough it's about you are creating avenues openings portals you're disconnecting yourself with god and you're connecting yourself with another flesh and when flesh overrides the spirit you're no longer following god you're following you
