's not interested in how much you made he's not interested in your good works he wants to know who did you speak to and give a testimony as peter gave in the book of acts that said men and women you were lawless in crucifying him but i shared with you today there is another option you can have jesus as your savior that's my receipts because the well done that good and faithful servant won't be about how i drop clothes off at the goodwill it'll be about the souls that i impacted it'll be about when i walked into the coffee shop and i heard the spirit of the lord speaking over me and i went over to somebody and said can i just lay hands on you real quick i just want to pray i'm not being weird i'm not being crazy but i believe this is one of my receipts that god is holding me responsible for see if we understood our gifts and our talents and our salvation was wrapped up in us having receipts for the work that we've done here on earth and that we're depopulating hell to populate heaven then we would understand there's a greater work than what i got my degree for there's a greater work than what my money is bringing revenue back on i understand that the good things that he gave me is to change the life of the lost sir ma'am i want to let you know this jesus whom they crucified was once dead but he is risen again and i have proof according to the documents of eyewitnesses not the bible but the documents that let us know he was once dead but he is alive again my question is when you walk into heaven will you have receipts for what you've done god is not interested in how well you
