heir ability it says because he knew of his ability he only gave him one and even with the one he was not able to bring anything back to the master but what he had already given him my area of concern is that god is trying to teach us a principle but we're trying to be at times overly spiritual and to spiritualize our lives without practical principles to be able to guide us to where we need to go so we're going to shout a blessing through we're going to speak in tongues a blessing through we're going to roll on the floor to bring a blessing through instead of getting our health together we're going to pray that god would just heal us instead of us eating right i'm coming to worship night because i need a miracle no what you need to do is stop eating the way you are so you don't have to deal with what you're dealing with i need god to break through and give me a miracle financially no what you need to do is stop spending uncontrollably and not having management issues and be able to live below somebody say below your means instead of every morning getting up and asking god to pay for something that he's already giving you money to pay it with don't feel spiritual do it because what god is requiring you to do is what he required adam to do which is to manage the earth that he had given him dominion over you don't understand that genesis lets us know that we have dominion over the earth but the problem that i'm lacking is that i've lost my dominion and now i become lazy and i'm expecting god to give me a miracle for every moment the miracle for every moment means i do no work
