s domain that word dominion he's saying this he's saying i want you now to populate the ground that i made on earth with common somebody the glory that i have in heaven so i'm gonna send jesus and jesus is going to teach you how to pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven in other words i gotta fear figure out how do i get the ground that's in heaven come on somebody to the groanings that's going on in earth the only way that you can take more ground is supernaturally because naturally he ain't making no more ground so what he says is when you get saved you become a kingdom agent and what i need you to do is to colonize earth with the ground and the glory that's in heaven and so when you place your feet somewhere i need you to make it move from hard to holy so how do i do that well 2nd chronicles 7 14 gives us an indication if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves come on look at the person next to you and says you ain't all that come on tell them he's not talking to the world he's talking to the church and he's saying if the church would understand that you have to break the spirit of pride and the only way that you can break the spirit of pride is with the presence of god if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and then what pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their ground the ground of your anxiety has to be healed anxiety will never cease until you take the ground of your mind
