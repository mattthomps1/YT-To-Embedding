 here's what i'm gonna do we're gonna start with the five many of us don't understand that what god is giving you is the starting place in the birthplace of trust and so if you can't lift the five you'll never be able to lift the 50. what am i saying i'm saying that if he can't trust you with five dollars he'll never trust you with fifty dollars and it's not even about the money because the money is the least place of reason it's the least place to trust the way i can i really wanna say it is this if you can't trust him with this when i'm told that i'm infertile and i can't have children i won't be able to trust them to still have children because the least place of starting was my money the true riches was my son was the least place my son was the true richest but if i did not develop a relationship of trusting him with money how could i believe him for a child [Applause] are you hearing what i'm saying it's the least place it's the smallest place this ain't about even getting god to buy favor you can't buy favor either [Applause] if you could buy it it wouldn't be called favor everything that god has for you is accessed by faith but entered through trust and trust starts one step at a time it's one small act at a time that you begin to develop but the question then becomes well why does it start with our money i know that's what you guys are asking you just don't want to see it why are you guys doing without money why why why why has got to be our money because you trust god in every other area but this one if god said man if you give me this weight you feeling the blame
