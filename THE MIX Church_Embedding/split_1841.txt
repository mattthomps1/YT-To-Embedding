out philip but it speaks to the disciples and they start searching around to figure out where can we get some food now the bible in mark lets us know that jesus asked them how many loaves do you have now what we're missing is like you if you're looking at the bible and i'm reading the same way where did the loaves come from that's the picture here what where did the loaves come from jesus we're in a desolate place all of a sudden loaves appear is this the old testament is manna coming from heaven what is this that we are a part of bible lets us know it's not manna coming from heaven but there's a resource that's not talked about often times there's something somewhere tucked in a corner not feeling valuable not feeling having any sense of ownership and purpose but god sees right where the valuable folk god he sees where the folk are that feel broken that feel misplaced that feel like they have nothing to offer and jesus says where are the loaves and how many are there that means that there had to be a resource in the desolate place my question today is are you praying for what's already existing [Music] it's just that you don't have the spiritual eye to be able to notice that that's what god is doing the bible lets us know immediately that they go back and count and says there are five loaves and two fish now we did the baltimore way and we fried our fish i don't know what they did i don't know if it was steamed i don't know if it was smoked on the rocks i don't i don't know what it was but i know it was two fish i don't know if it was lake trout or tilapia i don't know if
