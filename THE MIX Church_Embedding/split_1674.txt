o support the closest people in your life to their destiny god will send someone else to do what it is that you have not taken the responsibility to do and so as a husband i was going to let nobody else come in and support my wife's vision and dreams outside of me so what i made a decision to do was say okay let's talk about working this out and i'll never forget she said i want to start a daycare i said that sounds amazing she says i want to start it in the home i said whose because the way that i'm looking at it our home already has a daycare because we've got three kids i'm not sure if we can take any more and i'll never forget before we even got engaged she i asked her this was a question so i can be honest in it i said what do you want to do and she says i want to provide a place where i was absent of that there were women that would somebody would be able to help people go further while they had kids and would consider the life that they were trying to make for themselves how hard it was and that they would work with them and help them and i'll never forget and that was like in october of the year before and and so she started living that out and we had two kids in the house okay that wasn't too bad and and and and i would wait i was working here at the church as an administrator and a and a finance uh uh individual and and i never forget i would be like okay so they get they leave at six which means i'm going to leave work at 5 45 so i don't have to run into these children well it didn't work out that way because you know when you start a business you're looking for
