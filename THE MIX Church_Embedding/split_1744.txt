ate my decisions afterwards all right i get back to the place and i've got the ring on and and and and she bought me a new ring and i feel grateful but the problem often times in life is that i feel like what i've done is is a repeated pattern is that we make decisions and the emotional moments of life that have lasting impact on the future that god has intended for our lives and when we find ourselves in those places we don't know how to get forward so what we make the decision to do is to go backwards because it's easier to go back than it is to move past anybody know that to be true anybody know it's hard to end the argument when you're in the kitchen and you're walking past one another but you're acting like you're not speaking to anybody no it's always easier to stay in your mess than it is to get over it and get ahead and today i'm here today to let you know what's so important is the fact that i want to let you know there's no use in going back in the scripture we find in john 21 this moment where god has allowed the disciples to experience jesus's coming back and he appears to them in different times at different places and this is an incident of him visiting them and the bible lets us know that that he's visited them but here's the problem is that they're at the point in life where they're saying to themselves we don't know what to do after what has just occurred what's just occurred jesus died on the cross all of his disciples as we learned did what fled they left they all went their own way and how do you get back from the state of when you have left the savior b
