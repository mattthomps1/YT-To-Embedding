thhold see some of you got to get that perspective that if it's good gotta give it if it's good god will give it if it's good god will give it if it's good okay now you have to go further if it's good and it belongs to me god will give it if it's good and it belongs to me god will give it no good thing will he withhold listen from those who walk uprightly for those who walk righteous for those who are in good standing with him every good thing with your name on it belongs to you oh lord of hosts watch this blessed blessed will i just say past tense blessed is the one who what how am i blessed the one who trusts in you trust is present tense here but your present tense of trusting gives you the past tense of the god dawg of the blessing now listen here's what holy spirit or here's what the writers psalm is trying to get you understand when you trust god trust means to make my first choice and it's easy i got a little bit more time in the second experience so i can have some fun it's so easy it's so easy to make uh uh god your first choice when things are going well and it's so easy to make god your first choice when things are going the way you want them to go and it's so easy to make god your first choice when everything has fallen the way you wanted it to fall it's difficult to make god your first choice when things aren't the way you wanted to heaven and it's difficult to choose god first when it's not going the way you wanted to go but the writer's psalm says this if you'll make god your first choice then you'll be blessed [Applause] not my word that's god's word are you
