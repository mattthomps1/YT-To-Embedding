e pursuing after you have to prioritize your Pursuit if your children are falling away what do you have to put in front the children my question today is if your relationship with God is slipping have you prioritized it or are you expecting it to grow on its own can I tell you this if you if you don't know how to forgive and you hold on to anger what's going to grow from it anger right so the question is what are you watering some of you can I can I can I speak Deliverance in this house I'm just going to speak it real quick some of you that are dealing with perfectionism is because you keep watering the seed of comparison and everyone you want to be like is everyone that's on your storyline and everybody that's on your storyline keeps popping up and reminding you where you are you know I love that person and they keep popping up man I don't got 10 million dollars a day you like I hate myself I hate myself and you start throwing away your process not understanding that God is getting you to the finish line of where you need to be if you would just stay there but because you keep comparing yourself and you look at everyone else's life instead of looking at your own and being able to say I'm God's man I'm God's woman God has set me a hood God has put me as a Victor God has made me more than a conqueror instead of being able to feed yourself the things that God says I am not to I am the head and not to tell I'm above and not beneath I'm blessed anybody I know you blessed I'm blessed am I going out and am I coming in instead of repeating that I'm looking at everyone else's story
