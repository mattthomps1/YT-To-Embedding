scab and i was sitting there one day being a little nasty kid and i was sitting there picking my scab my mom came to the door stop picking your scab or your sore won't heal you don't hear what i'm saying and so what happens is i was trying to understand the blood and the lord took me back to my mom saying don't pick your scab because all the all the scab is is dried up blood because the healing is under the blood
