e ground scripture lets us know in Genesis chapter 1 verse 11-12 it says this God said let the Earth grow plant life plants yielding seeds and fruit trees bearing fruit with what see seed begets fruit fruit begets seed seed begets fruit fruit begets more seed if I have seed I don't waste it I sow it and from whatever I sow the sowing becomes something that I now reap but I so what again scripture says plants yielding seeds fruit trees bearing fruit with seeds inside of it each according to its what somebody say It's Kind throughout the Earth and that's what happened the Earth produced plant life plants yielding seeds each according to its kind and trees bearing fruit with seeds inside of it each according to its kind and God's saw how good it was sufficiency and what God is sowing a seed into here's the problem many of us want to reap from a harvest we've never planted [Applause] foreign what if you just took a a drive out to a farm today just take your car out to a farm and you just go like pull over and you see like a corn field I dare you just go over there and start pulling it up all right corn man free coin I promise you you will hear shots you will hear dogs you will see an attack on your life because nobody wants someone else to steal the seed that they oh that's a moment right there listen if you know anything about how long and how hard it took for you to get where you are today and you would tell somebody your testimony if you understood what we went through in the early part to get to where we are baby I did not get this out of luck I just need to breach for two
