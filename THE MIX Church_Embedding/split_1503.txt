for our students to get back to where they were so it's just understanding and being patient along with the process and understanding that there is no quick fix to where our students are whether it's emotionally or academically it's going to take a period of time and we have to be committed to that work moving forward awesome i would say that the gap widened if you're in an urban area or if you have a student urban school we talk a lot about the achievement gap it's been wide since the beginning now it's even whiter i'm at a school where most of my students are coming in they read we're not talking about kids who are non-readers but kids weren't socialized or educationized to be independent learners and so when you think about it from k to 9 10 11 kids were used to the teacher providing a lot of direct hands-on support i can raise my hand my teachers there i can you know go around the classroom resource and now that support is gone and so i think what it did for a lot of students was create a place of frustration um because now kids have to think more independently and they have to be focused because the inputs are coming in at a different speed in some cases we had to pivot from kids not having any homework right that's a lot of culture in high school don't have any homework on your homework well now everything is homework because now you actually have to practice um and so i think that it made it really really difficult to really determine who's struggling because now you have cameras off you know kids are in their bedrooms you don't know what's happening on the other end
