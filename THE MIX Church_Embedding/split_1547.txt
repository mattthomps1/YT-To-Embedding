which takes me to the scripture that once i start loving me i can start loving others the problem that we're running into is that we're trying to find love and we can't find love we need to have love before we go searching for what we think an irrational or an incomplete understanding of what love is what are you trying to find you're trying to find oftentimes someone to insert their space into what the areas of your incompleteness or the areas of where you feel inhibited and accurate or broken and what we're looking for is not love we're looking for somebody who can read our minds know our thoughts understand what we do why we thought it what we said because we say things like you would know that if you love me first of all i'm not so don't you base love on the information of what i should know about you you should base love on the commitment of what i have spoken of what i would do and who i would be in your life it's the consistency it's not the emotional roller coaster you're not gonna like me today but i'm all right cause i love me the context that i want you to get is that when you have found yourself to be separate whole and unique you begin to love you which means what you have done in you you have the ability to share with someone else not find for the need of completion of what someone can give to you in order to complete you there is no one that has the ability to complete you but god and god wants you whole before you connect with someone else because if they are not whole you will find yourself depleting who you are in order to try to complete someone else whic
