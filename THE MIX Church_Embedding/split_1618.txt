someone call his name he ran to eli here i am you called me but it wasn't eli he told samuel to go back to bed god called samuel three times and each time samuel ran to eli here i am he said eli finally understood that god was calling to samuel he told samuel how to respond samuel went back to his place and god called samuel samuel speak for your servant is listening samuel replied god told samuel that he was going to judge eli's family for their sin the next day samuel was afraid to tell eli what god had said eli asked samuel to tell him what god said so samuel did as samuel grew god was with him everyone in israel knew that samuel was god's messenger god used samuel to share his plan with the nation of israel samuel used god's words to tell the people what god is like john chapter 1 verse 1 says that jesus is the word jesus the son of god told the world about god's plan and showed what god is like when we talk about dedicating things to the lord we have a wonderful example in hannah she asked god for a son and promised that if he gave her one she would dedicate him back to god for all of his life it was no doubt a difficult thing for hannah to let go of and give her some back to the lord but she kept her promise she wanted to honor god and give him the glory likewise it is sometimes hard for us to dedicate our lives to the lord however we must remember that everything we have is a gift from god our families our homes our talent our education our jobs when we grow up and even our whole lives are a gift from god therefore we should dedicate all that we have back to the lord
