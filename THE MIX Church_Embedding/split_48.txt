ok like you want to go girl come to church with me no I'm good I'm all right that's okay because the idea is I'm living something that I don't even know what I'm doing and some of us have lost such connection with God in such connection with who he's called for us to be that we show up to moments with God out of responsibility with no expectation that anything is going to change and so we get here when's he getting up up there's the thing it came on he's coming out we supposed to stand up in this moment right hallelujah thank you Jesus he said talk to your neighbor hey neighbor all right he got 40 minutes let's go and you are clocking in your transformation and clocking out and so Pastor how how do I live the life that's more abundantly good question Proverbs chapter 3 verse one through two says this my son and daughters do not forget my teaching teaching is my precepts and my principles but keep my commands in your heart for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity what does that mean it means in order to experience the Abundant Life that God has for you it is going to require you to follow Jesus and allow his word to enter into your heart and guide you according to his word and the principles and teachings of the Bible not your preference not your opinion not your thoughts not the way in which you seem as right unto you not your emotions not your mood today not with your depression your anxiety not what your schizophrenia I'm trying to talk about everything we got around it is not according to it I follow his precepts and his principles hi
