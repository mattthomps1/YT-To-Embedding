re like i'm not going to do that because you know what i can't do all that and give it all up god says i'm not after what your possessions are i'm after your heart and the problem is is that our possessions have our heart that's why he is after your possessions you missed it you missed it you you got to get it because if not you're focused on the wrong thing that you think god is after and when god is tugging at your heart about generosity he's not tugging at your money he's tugging at your heart because your money has your heart the church won all my money what are we going to do nothing praise jesus no god says what i'm after is your heart because if i can release you from your money you could actually follow me see there's a barrier oftentimes between us and god that we don't see as being the possession point of what keeps us out of his will and because we're so possessive on the things that we have that we work for and that we want we're not available for god to speak do whatever it is that he wants to do because we are so focused on god being our genie you know god i need you to work it out this way you know you know i need you to do it this way you know i need you to work it in my stead i need you to fix it for me and god says here's the problem is that i want to fix it for you that way but that's not the way that i need for you to go because the way that i'm calling for you to go is the way that's going to make you and the way that's going to make you will make you to the person that you love but the problem is you keep making yourself into the person you can tolerat
