lished you and brought you into the Bible says a wealthy place but oftentimes the reason that we're not intentional with our now is because we don't value our next you don't value the seed you just value the Harvest God what can I get God says well what can you give in order to receive there has to be a giving without sowing there is no reaping you can act like you have a harvest you can steal from other people's harvests you can copy other people's harvests you can you see that you don't even have and and take from other crops that you don't really find yourself harvesting but here's the truth of the matter is you'll know when it's your seed because you did the work to get the Harvest the Bible lets us know the Harvest is plentiful but laborers are few we love to use that for church where is the people that want to work in the church where are the laborers God that's what that's where we're praying we use that voice because that's a it's a it has it has a has it has weight to it we are the laborers but the truth of the matter is God is saying we're the laborers out in the workplace that are called to speak my name as I'm blessing them and taking them to the next levels where are the people that were created for next because if you get comfortable all you will do is make decisions off of your now and I can promise you now that your now is speaking to your desires that you have today not the outcome that you want to see later anybody ever found themselves at the place I mean Pastor Ty this is his example I'll give him all the credit for it now when you go to the supermarket
