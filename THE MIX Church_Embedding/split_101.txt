e Lord brings prophetic voices to houses anytime God brings a prophetic voice to a house that's outside of your lead Pastor your leadership it's to confirm and affirm the direction that a church is getting ready to go in and so I'm thinking about the significance of this moment the Lord brings a prophetic voice to Baltimore to to minister to the mixed Church who just happens to be in a series called unfinished business and then you've got this prayer series called build a fire is anybody excited about where you're about to go watches on the Sunday I get here you have communion and so God is like mixed church are you going to be committed are you going to come into Covenant with what I'm about to do in this church this is what God is asking mix you going up you're already up but you're going higher when I say you're going up I'm just meaning there's another level test the person that you say there's always another level and I know for many of you you're thinking about numerically in real estate and finances I'm talking about we're starting with you in your heart we took communion but you took communion and so God says I'm gonna do some internal Ascension some some I'll do some real work inside your heart so that you can have the capacity to Bear what I do publicly but first I need to do some things privately in your heart so we're going to touch on Building A Fire we're going to touch on um uh unfinished business and I pray that as you guys going to next Sunday man you just set a blaze like I know you will be and you already are in Jesus name it's just time for another level
