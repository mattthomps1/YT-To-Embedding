ght now that I'm living beyond my means I'm living beyond my preference I'm living beyond my understanding I'm living beyond what's in my pocket I'm living beyond my political views I'm living beyond what I think in my mind and I've surrendered myself to the will of God today you know what I believe I believe that God's calling to us to have a church a church that's so in tune and so focused in and so and and I mean we're just in God so much that it doesn't matter how much outside of our preference it is we are sold to him that says God whatever it is that you want to do my answer is yes it doesn't even matter anymore I'm not considering because of the way that you love me the way that you've forgiven me the way that you've given your life for me all my answer is is yes so Paul writes to the church in galatia he says I have been crucified with Christ and I myself no longer live but Christ lives in me my question today is what's living in you heart heart unforgiveness a sense of resolution or I have to have Redemption from other people a sense of a lording over people's mistakes my question today is what's living inside I'm saying today Christ live inside of me dwell inside of me teach me and show me your way so that can live according to your will
