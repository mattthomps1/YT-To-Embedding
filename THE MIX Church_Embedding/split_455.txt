e're coming up to is the stage that's called the fruition stage where God moves abundantly or more than you can even think or ask every time you just begin to walk you don't understand how you're walking through the doors how God is putting you in places that you've never seen you are humble when you first started you know what you you were very grateful when you first started You Had a Heart of Thanksgiving when you first started but now that you're in it you think you all that you think you got it all together you think you're in the place where things are greater than what you got God said I will move you out the way he told them if you don't praise me I'll get the rocks to cry out I just want to tell you today I am great everybody grateful God don't move me don't take me out of position just allow give me one more chance I got this thing I'll be grateful again I'll be humble again I walk in your presence again I'll kneel I'll worship whatever it takes just use me just use me don't you dare get above God don't you dare think your gifting is so skilled and so collected that God will God will take everything you got and shift you right onto the side and say you know what I'll position you right here and you'll stay good where you are and you'll constantly stay good right there just keep going around in the same Circle doing the same thing looks like brand new people but God's like no because you wouldn't forsake other things because you wouldn't lay it down because you couldn't walk away from it and you wouldn't stay with me you wouldn't be like a tree planted by the river
