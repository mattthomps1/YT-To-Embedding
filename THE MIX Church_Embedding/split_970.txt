g so smooth about the temptations you know what i'm saying mr charles is that they were so alluring that it made the people go wow here's what i want to let you know is that often the enemy understands that temptation will make you go crazy if you're at the right point of desperation and the bible lets us know that as jesus has been qualified what are you saying pastor jesus has been baptized by john the baptist and the bible lets us know that the father qualifies him with the holy spirit to say this is my son in whom i'm well pleased he identifies jesus as being the son of god but the bible lets us know after he identified him of the purpose and understanding he is the messiah the bible says temptation came next can i tell you something real quick that oftentimes you're wondering now why when you got saved it seems like everything that the preacher said went opposite you are more than a conqueror you felt like you were failing all the time i would tell you you were blessed beyond your imagination and you went back and looked at your bank account after service was over and it seemed like it got more negative than it did the first time around but here's what i want to let you know is that so many times you don't understand is that at the pinnacle of the place of where your potential is about to move into your purpose it's the moment where the enemy is ready to strike against you i want to let you know when when he sees that he is no longer your god when he sees that he is no longer lording over you that you have taken off of the robe of darkness and you have put on the robe
