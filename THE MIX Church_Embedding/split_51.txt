body know you can have good health and good relationships but when your money is funny even for the most spiritual of y'all things get a little Shifty don't they you holy but you're Snappy how you doing fine okay wait hold on wait a minute what's going on nothing I love Jesus it doesn't really seem like it it intertwines the because there's a place in your life that in order to live on this Earth you need finances and when your finances are jacked up you're jacked up so you need God's blessing over your health you need God's blessing over your relationships and you need God's blessing over your finances your career where you are going Let the Church Say Amen when those aren't working together with God you find that your life does not feel fulfilled nor does it feel abundant and you live out of maybe one or two that are going well but you complain about the one and which is not going good and it becomes the constant conversation so while I have life more abundantly I'm living believing that God is going to give me eternity with him God says I want to resurrect your life on Earth I want to resurrect your life here so that you have something to be able to smile about because what you're saying is God is not just the god of my soul he's the god of my life of my health of my relationship he's the god of somebody say everything God over every area of my life I cannot be saved and broke and say everything is well because I find myself in a place where I'm stressing about the things of life that I cannot control God I need you over every component he's the god over your entire life
