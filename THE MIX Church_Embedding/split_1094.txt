at i'm supposed to be doing in this moment i recognize that i have a set agenda for a set purpose somebody say purpose when i go into each season of my life i've got to be able to declare and understand that for this season of it i have to do what is needed in the season even though it does not always feel comfortable for where i am some of us know that in january we talked about a hot summer body the problem is it's from january to may we did not do what was necessary for the hot summer body every time we heard this may i help you can i get a number one upsize of fries double the drink no ice you all know how we do and then june gets here and we're frustrated i don't understand i eat well i don't understand i don't know what's happening here's the problem it's that many times i get distracted in the process not following the season that i'm supposed to follow but i have an expectation of results that are not conducive to what i did in the season previous and the context is is that what you want to see in this season is only the result of what you did in your process if you expected to go and be a part of something amazing this summer if you expected to go on a vacation that was so amazing that you couldn't imagine and you wanted to see the blue waters but you did not save this summer can i tell you that you can have a staycation right at your home because whatever you prepared yourself for is what you see the result of now the question is is are you stuck in the wrong season that's moved on in your life and you're expecting different results from it that you have not done
