 I'm not at the point yet don't get that happy hold on oh he's already all right all of us operate out of three levels the first one is the need level the second one is the greed level and the third one is the seed level I'll repeat that one more time for those of you that are taking notes the first is the need level the need level is the place where I understand I am in need of God to supply the needs that I cannot supply for myself it is the place where I put my posture into a place of God I need for you to do and to move in my life I don't have it in actuality and resource so I'm submitted to when you do it only because I don't have the resources to do it for myself it is the most humbling place yet it can be the most depressing place because you're waiting on God to provide those things that seem very basic to an average person you're waiting for God to move Lord will you do it right now you'll remember the name place I remember the need place I remember the need place because I remember when I got married and I remember going to the gas count I would look at it and I would say I've got twenty dollars in there I've got to figure out food gas and I gotta hold it on until I get paid now don't act like you don't know when it's time to get paid when you're counting down the days and and you're holding the quarters and you never knew you had so much change in your life thank you the problem is you got a little too bougie you looking at change and you're walking over it I don't do those I don't do change you get to the cash register they're trying to give you change back uh n
