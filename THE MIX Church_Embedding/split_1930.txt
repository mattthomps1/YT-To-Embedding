an you have a destined outcome can i tell you some of us are regimented but we still don't have an expectation we're good i'm on it praying every morning pastor you can't come at me can't come for me i'm in my word i'm reading great what has god said haven't heard him in a long time possibility that your regiment isn't about your purpose your regiment has become religion and it's enough to make you feel good about you the problem is it's not producing results you ever seen somebody say i go to the gym all the time and you don't want to be judgmental but you just like all the time every day every day here's what you're saying you could be telling the truth but you're doing something to escape the results of what being in the gym every day will produce you can go to the gym every day but if you eat a pizza every day all of what you did in the gym won't make any difference because you'll never see the results because you weren't doing what needed to be done how do i manage what god's given to me first thing i need you to do is plan your day according to your purpose not your comfort plan your day according to your purpose not your comfort what's the purpose what are we going to do today oh we just gonna didn't we have things we wanted to do places god called for us to go is it gonna be a little uneasy sometimes yes yes because the difference with god is god is not in the miracle business because you're too lazy to do god wants to provide you needs for your needs that you don't have the ability to provide for yourself not for the needs that are pre-existing where you are that y
