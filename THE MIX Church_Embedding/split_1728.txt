what you did last night he knows what you're going to do tonight he knows the state of where your mind is god is all-knowing so stop hiding from him if you could just be comfortable and be like god this is who i am this is where i am this is what's going on with me i gotta release it somewhere the problem is is that we're not releasing and we're taking things with us and building our own sense of emotions that bring blockage for god to speak and to move in our life god is saying the best therapy you could ever have is in the morning with me how about you let me know everything that's god i woke up this morning and i'm just disturbed i don't know why i feel like a failure i feel like things are going back to where they used to be i need your help god's saying i know it all already and i've set up a path for you to already walk in so that you can meet the individual that was going to turn your heart around so that you could walk into the place that was going to change your mindset i've got it all together i just need you to recognize that i'm all-knowing [Music] if you knew god already knew then you would tell them the reason why we we keep things from god or we lie is because we believe that we're hiding something from god that he does not already know if somebody already know you did something then the best thing to do is to walk up to him be like i know you know so let's talk about it i know you know so let's get this thing out on the table i know you know so we might as well talk about this right now because the worst thing that god feels is that you can't trust him enoug
