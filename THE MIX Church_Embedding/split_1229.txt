h them showing mercy is when your classmate forgets his or her lunch money and you share your lunch with them so that they can have something to eat also showing humility is when you want to join in with other kids boasting at how well you play but the better action would be to praise god and thank the other teammates for a game well plea from the great prophet micah we learn how god wants us to live we learn three things that pleases god more than any sacrifice he wants us to act justly and fair show mercy and walk humbly before him when we do these things we not only live godly lives we become more effective at sharing jesus with others we will plant seeds to carry out the great commission because others will want to discover why we practice justice show mercy and live humbly someone may ask why are you being so kind to me someone else may comment she is always so humble i wonder how she can always be like that still another may say he always treats others fairly not like other kids when others see these qualities in your life they want to know what why are you like this and they understand that you are living for god so you have to open your heart to make positive change so that they can make positive change in their lives and then they will ask you what it why are you so positive it's because i live for jesus our memory verse for this week says blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it luke 11 and 28 thanks so much for helping me with the memory verse before we go let's sing and dance to one way by hillstone kids [Applause] [Music] there [Music] jesu
