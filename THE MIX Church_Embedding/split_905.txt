d then you wonder next what happens there's a there's a seed that is sown to those that are willing to build relationship and have discipleship it says that that seed is sown and it produces good grain good harvest but it takes time for harvest to grow the problem is is that you're getting into a space in a church where you have all of these requirements but you have no time to suffer and your lack of suffering has put you into a place of depletion where you have nothing to hold on to and the bible says there's a seed for those but they've gone through something they've been through something they weathered the storm they've walked through they've been in the valley of the shadow of death they found themselves broken at times but they said lord you are my god and i will never forsake you the bible says hey they gotta see let's see that's these gonna grow real well they they're in a place but the problem is for the rest you're trying to figure out why twenty percent of the church is impactful you're trying to figure out why the city is still the same way it's because the other people have not built time in relationship can you make it to mixed groups i can't this week because um you know i got my schedule the way my schedule's lined up i can't really really make anything i don't really have time for discipleship you know because i gotta go to work and you know my work if they fire me i don't have a job pastor and and so i'll stay a good convert i say a good convert the enemy every week you start coming he said oh look at her she's she there again trying it all out again tryi
