 the Lord began to fill the room and my inside didn't change but I knew the outside did because I felt a shift in the atmosphere and I just begin to praise God even though I didn't feel like see I'm trying to get you to a place where you no longer considering what you feel like it's a responsible party to get you where you're going you are truly trusting and depending on the holy spirit so I said holy spirit have your way and the spirit of God began to move in the place and I just begin to sit there I said I don't feel it he said it's not for you to feel it's for you to trust by faith I'm doing this thing that's what passion offering is about it's by faith that I believe in what God said it's already yes and amen so that's what I did and I sat there I sat there and then he brought this to me as I the Lord did not resolve my emotion that night and the scripture said weeping may in door for a night I said what kind of foolishness is this you're not gonna make me feel better he said no cause I'm not the god of your feelings I'm the god over your life I said so I'm gonna make you sit in the feelings why I still have victory in the moment I said what are you so I got the scripture said whipping may endure for a night I didn't feel better all night not all night I woke up this morning [Music] I said what is this [Music] I said wait something changed he said Joy Joy comes in the morning I said what he said Joy comes in the morning I'll take you through and sustain you Joy comes in the morning and the morning I woke up I said hey babe how you doing she said you're doing much better
