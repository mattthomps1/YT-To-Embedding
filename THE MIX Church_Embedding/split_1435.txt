ing to different season in this pandemic everybody's like man i just wanted things to get back to normal the problem is as normal as yesterday why do you want yesterday's blessings if tomorrow's blessings are greater that's the thing we think normal means i don't have to operate in faith i don't have to move any further than where i am i don't really have to extend myself but the truth of the matter is is that you need to be able to be shaken by what god is doing so that you can believe god for what's happening tomorrow not believing god for what happened yesterday because if you're believing god for what happened yesterday the problem is yesterday already happened so you don't need faithful for what god already did you need faith for what god is about to do you got to expect the unexpected you got to expect what's not about to happen you got to expect god to do the things that you've never seen before you've got to expect god to move in ways you've never expected him he moved before that's why your prayer life would be so dynamic is because you would be expecting god to answer prayers for things you haven't seen yet what are you expecting god to do in this moment in this year at this time that you haven't seen god do before you're like i just wanted to keep me he kept you yesterday he's pretty good at that he's proven himself he can keep you what else can i explain real quick why some of us don't have expectation it's because the lord has already done enough to meet the level of where we never thought we would get to that we never dreamed or envisioned anything greater tha
