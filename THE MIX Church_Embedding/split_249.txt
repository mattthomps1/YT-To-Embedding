is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor so she a little bit stalkerish understood boaz's schedule and Naomi is able to get to her this clarity she says wash therefore and anoint yourself and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor but do not make yourself known to the man she says have some self-control just cause you're single don't mean you you don't need to have some self have some self-control keep it chill all right she says wash therefore and anoint yourself put on your cloak go down to the threshing foam don't make yourself known to the man until he's finished eating and drinking women Point number one don't interrupt your man while he's eating all right but when he lies down observe the place where he lies then go and uncover his feet and lie down and he will tell you what to do and she replied all that you say I will do so she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of grain then she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid out at midnight the man was startled because she low cray-cray and turn over and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who are you now this is not Karen so don't do this in real life if you find a man that you like brothers you find a woman that you like do not go and lay at her feet right now you can be arrested he said who are you and she answered I am Ruth your servant spread your wings over your sermon for you are a redeemer and he said may you be blessed by the Lord
