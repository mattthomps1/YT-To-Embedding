here we are in relation with people and where they are in their life so good is subjective good is subjective to what we believe it is so we got to be careful with saying somebody's good because that subjective good can change according to the set of circumstances or places where we find people to be good good jesus is good that's what he lets us know jesus is good here is where i think we may fall off sometimes is that jesus is good when things are good and the idea that jesus is good when things are good equates my definition to how i think his actions fare with my opinions if jesus is good then it's according to the set of circumstances that i'm in jesus is good when things go my way jesus is good when i have a good doctor's report jesus is good when things fare out the way i want them to jesus is good when i receive an extra check in the mail that i didn't know i was going to receive jesus is good when i get a large fry instead of a medium jesus is good jesus is good when things are better than they were but the question is is jesus still good when things that i prayed for have not come to pass or actually have gotten worse than what they originally were is jesus still good when things are pushed back further than i set up in the plans of what i constructed for my life when my five year goal turns into a seven year and a seven year turns into a ten year is he still good that's the question that we're facing today because if not he is a good master but not a good god he's a good teacher he's a good ethical person there's good morals that the bible has there's good good t
