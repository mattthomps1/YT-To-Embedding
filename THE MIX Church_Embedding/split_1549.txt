feelings i married you because of your choice love is a [Music] choice here's the problem most of us know how to feel love we just don't know how to operate in love because we haven't walked through what true love is can i define to you what true love is and just give you a moment and clarity to understand where we are the first thing that i want to give you clarity is through god's word in mark chapter 12 verse 30 through 31 jesus begins to tell us all right this is how you're going to love this is really really important he says and you shall love the lord god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength that's everything you got that's the first place to start in your wholeness loving god he says the second is this you shall love your neighbor as your self you can only give out what you are getting in the reason why you have conflict with so many people is because of the struggle of love within you oh we want to say that we ain't trying to do that today pastor we're not trying to do that i love me do you do you really love you so much that it pours out to love others or is the criticism that you give out so much a reflection of the insecurity and the lack of love that you have within your self if you complain or talk about people a lot there's probably an insecure place on the inside of you that has not been filled by the love of god so you need to find incompleteness in other people in order to feel good about who you are and where you're going if you love you you just be looking around like yeah man i just love on you you're great he
