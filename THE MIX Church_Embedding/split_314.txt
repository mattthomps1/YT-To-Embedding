d we're laying this groundwork as we are giving a lesson today I'm going to extrapolate the idea and the context of this message and this idea of this passage of a story about two brothers Baltimore twins and what the importance is of understanding what God has placed inside of you these young men are sons of Isaac Isaac is the son of Abraham Abraham is the father of Israel and the promise that is given to Abraham through God is that he will be the father of many nations Abraham is given a promise but oftentimes when God promises us things we tend to take his promise into our own hands we have the idea that we can do better than God we can go faster than God we have a clear vision of how we want it and so we tend to take over that in which God is spoken and we take it into our own hands and then scripture we'll see is that God has no favorites but he does have favor and as God moves in favor there's an understanding to this idea that from that lineage of Abraham there was a blessing he told Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 I will bless you so that you can be a blessing that's what we spoke today that's what we have believed in 2023 that every blessing that God blesses us with is a opportunity for us to be a blessing we get to a part in this story where we understand Jacob is one whom is close to home he is one in whom is it's not like his brother Esau Esau is a hunter he is a Wilderness man he is one who goes after uh his game and his haunt and so Esau finds himself at a place at verse 29 where it comes in and it says this once when Jacob was cooking stew it said Esau came in
