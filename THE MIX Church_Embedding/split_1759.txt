hat i'm going to see for my life for what i want to see for my finances for what i want to see for my spiritual walk i just believe i've seen too much for me to rest that where i am can i tell you today you're not too old to change and you're not too young to start making a move i want to speak it because god is saying if i still have you here on this earth i have a destiny a purpose and a plan for your life your expectations are different here's how i can help you by the time we get to new year's eve i want you to write down what you're expecting god to do in your life in this new year if you haven't written an expectation plan then you have nothing to look forward to you'll just accept the day as it comes but what are you looking for in your family what are you looking for from your children what are you expecting from your relationship can i tell you today if you could write that thing out you would have something to pray for when we get to 21 days of prayer and fasting on january the 9th and i'm here today to let you know you'll see god do exceeding and abundantly above all that you could ask a thing the scripture says in hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 he says let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering because the one who made the promises is reliable if you haven't written a note if you haven't kept the thought i want you to just have one thing in your mind my god is reliable i may can't rely on anybody else i may can't rely on what anyone else says you may can't rely on what someone else says they were going to give you i just want to let you know toda
