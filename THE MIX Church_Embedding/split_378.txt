 I'm in a dog walking community and uh I see it I haven't had a dog for a while now I want to start off saying that I used to have a Chow Chow you know if you remember that's that's a dog that looks like a bear or a lion it's a little little small one but he's very aggressive very aggressive very very aggressive um and uh we we would call him his name was koi and I never forget my my dad brought him um he was truck driver and he brought him in in the dug he was just so adorable anybody know about adorable watch out for adorable things I'm that's not Bible but I'm just telling you watch out for adorable things they can be terrorizing grows up but this dog is highly aggressive highly strong and we have this wasn't out back in the day you just had a good grip leash you know the kind of that can wear your hand out is yeah and the leashes have gotten they've gotten real tricky now and then but this it was we had one of these one of the one of the hey hey hey hey all right all right and what we were trying to do is because we understood the aggressive nature of what was inside of him we had to keep him on the leash he could not be released in the dog park he's not a dog park kind of dog he had to be on the leash carrying him making sure because he was looking for something to get into and so the leash this kind of leash kept us pulling him but but but but there was these other leashes that that I I'm noticing now that there's this kind of leash where it gives you Doug a little lead way and I think some of us in our lives we God has given us this you you're successful you're killi
