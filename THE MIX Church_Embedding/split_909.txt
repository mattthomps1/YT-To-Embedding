message of i'm walking into my season but we don't like the message of it's going to take time it's a season of preparation the bible says the disciples followed jesus at least for three years we trying to get you through three classes of growth track you're like i can't do it it's three sundays in a row bro my sundays you're messing up my brunch we don't like being inconvenienced but we want great results we want shifting power we want healing words we want god to manifest his presence in our life the problem is is i don't have time to build relationship and if i don't have time to build relationship i don't have time to know who he is and if i don't have time to know who he is i don't have time to know what he's saying that's why time with god matters so much you said the church was forcing me in devotions no we were trying to prepare you for discipleship so that you could hear the voice of the lord for yourself and so that you could stop being swayed by every broken and wrong and false prophet that's out here because you need a tickling of the ear i'm trying to help you fish for yourself for the things that god has for you instead of waiting for somebody to tell you what your purpose is well pastor what should i do are you asking me because you really want to change or are you asking me because the idea behind it is you can't hear from god god's calling to prepare you point number two god wants to enable you anybody i know that's enabled turn on some of you need to be turned on because you weren't living you were just existing when you came to know christ he enabled you
