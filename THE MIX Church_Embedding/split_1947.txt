ever i want it because i seem to have control because i can let people come in and come out of it because i could go where i want i mistakenly thought that the car was minds and the way in which i used it and the way in which i handled it and the way in which i operated was up to me i forgot to look in the glove compartment inside of where the manual is because if i looked inside of there it would let me know who the insurance was under and who the owner of the car was and what i want to let you know had i remembered that more often i would have been more careful in the way that i used the car not expecting there would not be consequences for the actions of using it inappropriately the question that i'm asking myself today is do i understand that what i have is god's can i say to you today that everything that we have that everything that we own that all of what we are doing in this life it all belongs to god [Music] the scripture lets us know that there is a parable a parable is a story to give you an emphasis in teaching that jesus tries to use in this moment to give clarity to where uh the people are he wants to explain to them about finances he wants to explain to them about the management of their finances i want to let you know kingdom principles are principles that help you operate in a place where you have given your heart to god and the rules look a little bit differently than how you used to operate without him so now we have what is setting up is jesus is letting this story and he's putting it together he said i want to let you know that this is what it's like it
