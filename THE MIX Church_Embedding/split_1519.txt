l when there was still a live an active super active pandemic and so hearing people say like oh i'm still working in my basement i'm like yeah that ended a while ago and i think the work of educators has quadrupled because you guys are talking about crisis well people often call the principal the teacher first and we're saying well we're the first we're the first line and so if you know an educator if there's one in your family this is where you also extend that person grace because they're having to navigate their own families and then let's say you're a t-drive teacher with 200 kids my ninth grade has 200 students that's 200 families that call that's 200 kids to see if they're in school and so that level of stress and responsibility and then fear because there's still a pandemic right you're still going into a situation that could lead you to you know contract covet yourself so that fear as well is bubbling out there so it's been really traumatic and stressful to be leading while you're supporting kids families parents neighborhood issues have not changed they've actually gotten worse and there's not enough conversation about now that people are in these stressors how does that affect schools because the neighborhood comes into the school more often than not and so i just wanted to lift that there's a lot happening that doesn't often get mentioned in the context of education because we're thinking only about can kids read and write and that's not exactly the full breadth of what it means to educate young people and i think those uh those stressors um are going to manifest
