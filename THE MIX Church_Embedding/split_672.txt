ove out of my purpose and not out of my preference [Music] we love labels because labels keep us from being responsible labels keep us in the place where I have something to blame for why I am what I am and for why I am where I am and I love a good label because if God is telling me to go and move and speak I can just tell god I'm an introvert uh Lord you know I don't do that you know that's not me you I don't talk to no never no not me can't be and we deny what God has created on the inside of us for the preference of who we think we are and who we think God has created us to be I want to know today what label have you placed in your life that gives you the excuse for moving beyond Where You Are because if you really knew who God created you to be you would be much more available regardless of the fear regardless of the pain regardless of the insecurities you would say if I only knew that's what God had destined for my life I would move beyond that conversation I would have talked to them earlier I would have moved into that interview and said what I would have said I would have been everything God you declared me to be but because I love the label because the label keeps me in my box and the box keeps me safe and the safety keeps me from having to deal with my fear and the fear helps me keep from going back to my past and I've created every wall and every barrier and every boundary to be able to keep me so I blame God for who I am and where I am but God says that has nothing to do with who I created you already to be you are a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do goo
