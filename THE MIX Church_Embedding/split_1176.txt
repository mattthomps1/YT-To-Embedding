n the holy spirit i never forget i kept saying it over and over i want the holy spirit god empty me of anything that's like not like you and i'm here today to let you know i had to be a teenager i don't know how old i was but i'll never forget i was in my room and laid prostrate on the floor and i just kept saying jesus i need your holy spirit jesus i need your holy spirit i can't do it without you and i never forget i began to speak in tongues and the lord baptized me in the holy spirit and i laid on the ground now let me tell you the kind of house i grew up in is that they knew about this and my parents prayed over me and went into their room here's why because god doesn't need any help he doesn't need assistance he didn't need somebody to conjure it up in me he didn't need to take me in the back room and make it happen it was my heart that was open to do what he said do when i said lord jesus i want to receive your spirit i went in and laid all night and just began to speak in tongues and the lord filled me with his holy spirit and he's working constantly in me daily but i want to let you know the spirit is offered to you today
