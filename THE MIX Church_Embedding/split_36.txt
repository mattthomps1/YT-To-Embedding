Be Afraid don't be hopeless don't think there's nothing to it sometimes you just gotta say it out of your mouth I want her leg here I want my family restored I want my son out of jail I want my children help I need you to heal my heart of unforgiveness I need you Lord remember face will get you there you have to make a move though and I need you today to think about making a move of Faith towards God that's the way to that good life
