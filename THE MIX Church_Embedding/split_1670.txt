g for occupancy and so i'm here today to let you know your destiny is just waiting for occupancy your purpose is just waiting for occupancy and so when god has called you to it don't think he's getting it together you've got to know that thing is already done it is yes and amen the bible lets us know in verse 25 it says at the end of the 40 days they meaning the spies returned from spying out the land and they came to moses and aaron and to all the congregation of the people of israel in the wilderness of paran at kadesh it says they brought that word to them into all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land now here's the understanding is that they were decreed and declared over that what they would be walking into is a land flowing with milk and honey and the land that had fruit that was almost the size of them and god is calling you not to a destiny of just enough he's calling you to a destiny of more than enough and so he's calling them to this they see it and they're here to tell about the story of what they have seen verse 28 says this however the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large and besides he says we saw the descendants of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of negeb the hittites the jebusites the amorites he says dwell in the hill country and the canaanites dwell by the sea and along the jordan sometimes we are noticing the wrong things we're noticing the complications of getting to the blessing instead of noticing the blessings and oftentimes we're talking to god about what's been the problem
