ge and when you're on edge and when you're not thinking about things and when you think things are hopeless you have certain impacts and reactions and those reactions unfortunately cause certain incidents that then you know end up and result with them being charged to be my client so like there's it's a really really really you know there's a lot going on right now at the same time and we're in a very fragile place and that's i think a direct correlation what goes on during the pandemic right now anyway a lot of the stuff that we're talking about here and i'm also seeing it even though i'm not you know representing clients in that sense i'm seeing an increase in students who have been charged with violent crimes during the pandemic and i believe that you know if you weren't engaged if you were having a negative experience log into zoom every day and you decided to just be checked out then how are you feeling that time and so we have several students who committed serious crimes that were released quickly and they're waiting to be adjudicated and so now the school is trying to play this you know we know your sentencing is coming because it's pretty clear what happened and we're trying to make sure school is still this really safe space and now you have kids who are immediately triggered because they're in this level of high sensitivity at all times and so it's it's crazy how much our worlds collide even though you're going to education not thinking you're ever going to interface with a criminal justice system we're almost like colleagues in a sense because of what we're deal
