 who can follow but be different i need some men and women who can uphold what god has said over their life and be something greater and not just be a duplicate it's like sometimes you walk to people and you want to say i've seen you before and what you're saying is is i may not have physically seen you but i've seen you before because you look you talk you operate and you move in the same mindset that everybody else does and i'm here to expose the enemy because i believe that if we can get a generation and a group of men who understand they were made in the image and likeness of god that we are so great that god didn't even create vegetation on the earth until he had in genesis it says for someone to be able to work the ground and till the crown he said the responsibility and the dominion that i give you as a man to command to direct and to give instruction to comes from me if we had a group of men that could be such aware of what god was saying and knew the signs of the time then they would be able to lead a community into a place of strength and direction but the problem is is we're trying to follow everybody else and i'm here today to let you know you're more unique than you understand the scripture says in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9. it says this but this is precisely what is written it says god has prepared somebody say prepared means it is ahead of time he's not preparing he's not doing it while you're here he has somebody say this word again prepared which means it's already done tell your neighbor real quick it's already done he has prepared things for tho
