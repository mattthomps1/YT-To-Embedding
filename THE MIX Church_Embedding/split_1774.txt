ey couldn't get a prayer in they kept nodding off can i can i tell you that you've got to stop believing your destiny in the hands of others because everybody doesn't have enough to be able to stay up and pray for you in the moments when you need the greatest prayer that's why a relationship with god is so important is because in the most desperate times of when you need him everyone isn't always available pastor i need you to pray for me i'm sorry but i didn't see my phone because i shut it off and put it on silent and i don't know that you're having an issue so you've got to have a relationship with god to be able to carry you through this moment rather than spending your energy getting frustrated on me because i didn't pick up or text you back you've got to have something greater with god that gives you the ability to know that if god is for me and god is with me then nothing can stand against me you gotta have something on the inside of you to know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you gotta have something on the inside that let you know i'm more than a conqueror i got to have something on the inside that says i can't fall at this moment even when no one else is around my destiny is still at risk the bible lets them know that in this moment destiny interrupts the conversation and judas one of the twelve in whom jesus actually called betrays him and betrays him with the kiss and the bible says we have a breakout that happens people talk about baltimore has crime look at the bible i don't know anybody's ear that's been cut off lately the bible
