 here to show you the good parts of me and the good parts say i've got something great living on the inside of me i'm not like i used to be i'm not who i used to be so when god begins to untie you stop running away to get tied back up and start saying lord i know you want to use me when you when when you're tied up oftentimes you can only go but so far when you're tied up that you you feel like there's there's there's a realm that god is uh uh trying to keep you in that you feel like you're locked into i want to tell somebody today you don't feel like god has answered your prayer but he's tied you up on purpose so that you wouldn't get too far from what he called you too because when he needed to get to you he wants to make sure that you haven't been used by everybody else he wants to make sure your gift hasn't been exploited by everybody else he wants to make sure that when the time comes for him to use you you are in some good condition some of you have been tied up because you've been healing some of you've been tied up because because you're getting your mind back to where it is some of you are tied up because god is teaching you to trust again some of you are tied up because god is exposing you again to areas and people that you haven't been able to be exposed to before some of you are tied up because god's working on you but i just want to let you know today it's time for you to get on tithes god is saying go and go in on time go and release them see because this untied it when when i when i get tied up i can only get to a certain certain place hey charles can you jus
