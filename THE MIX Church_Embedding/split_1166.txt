out anyway it says it when i hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover that's what he said how you feeling you fry why would you what you talking about pastor we had outreach together she said pastor i didn't come last sunday because my back is hurting and i'm gonna try to make it this week she said but i'm just not sure i said cool the bible says and signs will follow them so what we do we pray father in the name of jesus heal her back right now so that she can move and come she said we were inside the clothing store together and she said to me pastor it's getting better i said i know no no here's what i want to give you because if you go further on an axe after they receive the holy spirit which i'm gonna get to peter and john said why are you looking on me as if i did it ain't got nothing to do with this not my power not my might it's by the spirit [Applause] so what he says is the church is supposed to be operating in the spirit that brings about the giftings that can cast out the broken areas and people's lives and bring healing in the name of jesus mark 16 says the church proves it's the church through the giftings of the holy spirit because we'll talk about the witness but the problem is we won't have any experience with the witness that's what separates the church from being powerful or entertaining it's the power within the church just tell your neighbor real quick we need the power so so so mark chapter 16 says listen there's something coming there's a baptism of salvation when you see me give the prayer lord jesus i give my heart to yo
