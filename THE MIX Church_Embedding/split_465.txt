 not what has just your family member or your good friend but what has the Lord said to you when's the last time you've heard the voice of the Lord it says he said to me Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my Courts for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father I will establish if you have a physical Bible that's a great place to underline he said I will establish Pastor why is that important because there is some of us who do not have a past that has been established for us so God is calling you to establish I want you to get that because some of you are discrediting the reasons why you cannot be the one in whom God has chosen to go further and the issue is is because you keep looking at your past as being the reason that you cannot move forward in your future but I'm here today to let you know is that if you did not come from it you're called to establish it you don't have to keep complaining about who was not there you don't have to keep establishing who left you you don't have to keep living in the premise of the things that got disconnected you do not have to keep remembering the ways in which it did not work out what I want to let you know if it had not been established for you you are called to establish it tell your neighbor real quick he's looking for you he said I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unwavering and carrying out my commands and laws as is being done at this time he said David and I'm speaking this to elders and and those in whom are older that he said I I now charge you he said in the sight of all Israel and
