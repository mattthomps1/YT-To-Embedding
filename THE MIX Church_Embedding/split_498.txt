ease and let go just write in the comment section real quick now is the time it's time I think it's the time for you to understand that wow you had the opportunity it is called for you not to waste it on the things that don't even matter anymore that person is long gone that person is dead that person is far away from you and yet you are still suffering because you won't forgive or you want to ask for forgiveness I think about oftentimes if I didn't know early in my first years when it came to marriage I would have forgiven or asked for forgiveness the latter is probably the one that is the most I would have asked for it a lot faster can I tell you what time does and unforgiveness it builds resentment and it builds Pride and it builds a wall and a barrier in you that when it would have been easier at the beginning it's harder at the end can I get real serious with you like can I really tell you that there are often times that many of us have found that abuse has taken place and our lives are in the lives of someone else and we don't know how to forgive and time has brought such a barrier in our hearts that we don't really know if we can forgive and I'll say this to you today it's that unforgiveness is a root of hurt and Brokenness inside of you you may be saying pastor I've learned to deal with it and I've never even said anything and I hold that person to it and I'm saying to you today it is rotting your soul it is keeping you and your anxiety it is keeping you in your depression it is keeping you in your addictness you think you've moved on but it is keeping you where you
