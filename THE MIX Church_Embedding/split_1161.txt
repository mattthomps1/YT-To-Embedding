[Music] we have had an amazing time today and so grateful for all that god has done and is doing if i can tell you so and i really believe that uh the lord is speaking in the house you said pastor you see what time it is [Music] i'm just already saying what y'all thinking don't mean to act like y'all wasn't thinking that [Music] you turned over to you whoever you came with how long what you think you're gonna do like how long i think you're gonna be it's been a call sunday no i'm not i'm not gonna do that to you but can you jump in your bibles real quick so i can pour some things into you real quickly [Music] and believe that god is going to do something i believe deliverance is in the house i believe freedom is in the house i believe healing is in the house in jesus name we're closing out our series in week four the truth about jesus we're going to jump into the word of god i want to jump first at the scripture at matthew chapter 28 verses 19 through 20. this is jesus's commission to his disciples after his resurrection before his ascension and the bible lets us know that he gives instruction because if jesus is with you that means he's going to instruct you on what to do because he says my sheep know my voice and if the lord is speaking it means he's instructing god isn't speaking to create because he's created everything that he needs to create so he's instructing or giving revelation to the next direction so the bible says that this is a commission that he gives to the disciples verse 19 he says to them go therefore and make disciples of all nations somebody say all nat
