 of that computer screen and teachers are just teaching and so that way of knowing oh you look confused let me re-teach that that's obsolete i also feel like it was an opportunity i went from a school where we had computers for attendance purposes for entering grades but not being used for instruction and so i felt like it was an opportunity that we seized and that at dunbar you know the dunbar we had to figure out how to use zoom and google classroom and uh paradex and nearpod and we found through research and lots of youtubing lots of educational platforms that actually have made learning more interactive and i believe more productive so i would say it was twofold obviously kids struggle like my my colleague says that you had kids that went from being successful to kids who were struggling but now schools had to be accountable differently because if kids aren't logging in i can't just accept that 20 of my students were missing so now as the leader i have an opportunity and i was home in my living room i could have said well 80 online is good we're just going right with the 80. that 20 missing was gonna come back this year and be even more behind and so it was an opportunity also to think about how we're engaging families how we're engaging the kids that we know are struggling how do we equip teachers with now a different responsibility for engaging parents differently um so it's been a mixed blessing but i also feel like it's created a space to catch up with the 21st century in terms of how learning is delivered also i think that uh parents in here don't have any parents
