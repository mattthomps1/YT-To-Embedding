re associated with today i want to let your destiny know that it was created already before there was a president or political party your destiny was created before there was a degree or specific area that you have i want to let you know that you were already set in place by god today the question is is will you make yourself available to god for him to let you know what it is he has called for you to do and i'm interested to know that because oftentimes we look at purpose as a destination in order to get to but truly purpose is the place in which you stay right now purpose is not a destination purpose is not a future job purpose is not a position that you get to purpose it's not a name that they will call you purpose is fulfilling what god says you are right now and who you will be in your future and if you could grab a hold of that i think you would stop putting so much confidence in what you do and you will stop putting confidence in who you are who does god say that you are who does god declare that you are i think that it's important that you understand that every time that you move along and every time that you move forward and every time that you see yourself operating that god is trying to fulfill purpose and destiny in your life yes yes yes i want to help you out real quick to understand it's not the job that you're doing it's not the position that you hold it's all that god has declared over your life your destiny is in god's hand now if you really believe that here is something that will be defined in your life is that you would be defined not by what is controll
