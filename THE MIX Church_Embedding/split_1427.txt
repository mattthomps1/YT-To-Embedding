what save me i don't care who hears me but i'll yell it out jesus save me jesus save me the bible says immediately immediately he reached down his hand and took hold of him saying to him oh you [Music] of little faith why did you doubt [Music] the bible says when they got into the boat when ceased sometimes the circumstance you're in won't calm down until you step out in faith and trust god i'm holding that spot right there this is when the wind sees that i don't know if you were in baltimore in the surrounding area yesterday when when the snowstorm was going and it started snowing at one moment it looked like it was dying down and then the next moment it looked like all of us were going to be like the wizard of oz and we were going to go somewhere [Music] the storm had to get through its cycle some of us are praying for god to end the storm too early and if he ends the storm too early you don't get to learn the lesson that he's trying to teach you so you've got to let the storm pass every time the storm doesn't need to end sometimes the storm needs to pass so that you can learn what you're supposed to learn in the condition of what the storm brings sometimes if i can tell somebody today the storm is your catalyst the storm is everything you need to toughen you back up and give you the resilience you need to know that the lord is on your side i don't know who i'm talking to today but you've been praying about the storm all you need to do is say lord don't end the storm just keep me through the storm because the storm is the catalyst for your next season of what you've been
