 to do something in you and in doing so I believe that there is something to understand that while he has brought me out of Darkness I have to be responsible for walking with him through what we call The Marvelous Light to see what John 10 and 10 says that he came that we might have life and life more abundantly it is found that Moses has passed away and God is setting up this new generation for a season of somebody say possession I believe God is calling for us to possess and I believe God has something in store for you today and so we're going to jump in Joshua chapter 1 starting at verse 1 through verse 3 and Joshua is now the new leader over God's people and he says this after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord the Lord said to Joshua the son of nun Moses assistant now here's where God gets a little harsh and you got to understand there's a great side there's a true sight there's a loving side those are all a part of God but also God has a real side and sometimes we don't like the real side of God because it seems like he's not emotional or connected as the Bible says that we have a high priest who cannot uh who can really understand the touchings the feelings of our infirmities we have a high priest who understands everything we go through but in this moment Jesus under God understands well here's what he's saying even though I understand I need from you to move on from where you've been hurt to where I'm calling you to be and he said this to Joshua and he said he says in verse 2 Moses my servant is dead while God thanks I remember it says Thou therefore arise
