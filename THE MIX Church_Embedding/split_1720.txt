cy on us now here's where i've got to break the story for you because the only way in which they knew that jesus was near is that someone had to be able to tell them that the lord was passing through now in order for them to even care that jesus was passing through must have meant that there was something that they knew about what jesus had just done jesus being on tour they saw the highlight reels they heard what he had done with the woman with the issue of blood they they heard that he was taking people one by one and healing them they they heard that he was raising the dead they heard that jesus was passing through and there's something just enough to hear that god is passing through to make an assertion to say if he'll do it for someone else he'll do it for me and i'm here today to let you know that god is here to do it for you it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter what life has brought you god is here to do it for you today don't you count yourself out don't you put yourself in the place where you say god won't walk past god won't heal me god won't deliver me i'm here today to let you know that if you could cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me you can get the attention of god my question today is in 2022 are you willing to get god's attention for your healing for your deliverance for your change if you are can somebody say thank god in this place i'm believing because right now as you're thinking god god is moving and he's doing as you're thanking him right now he's changing your circumstances as he's as you're
