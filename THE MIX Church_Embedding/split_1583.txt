ble says he said i wish that none would perish but that all will come into what repentance so let me clarify this for you god does not impose on you his will unless you accept it so he's not forcing you and sending you a person he's introducing people to you for you to make a decision eve was not forced on adam adam took eve to be his wife i want to let you know today why you love that person you're with god did not tell you that's the one the lord showed me no he didn't what the lord gonna show you is your brokenness not your marital upgrade that's hard y'all because we have the tendency that to believe that god is more concerned about what we want than what he wants for us what he wants for us is salvation so if god would impose any kind of will it would be that you be saved if he didn't impose that on you he's not going to impose a marital person to be your spouse why because if god gave you the person he has to take the responsibility for when things go wrong and god does not fail i'm good with golf claps today i'm good with them all right y'all i listen i know how relationship series look they'd be like you know god told me this was my mate no no no no because you questioned whether your mate when y'all were in that argument last week excuse me i'm just i'm just excuse me i thought that was funny let me let me read the bible verse to get serious first corinthians chapter 7 verse 17 it says this and don't be wishing you were some where someplace else or with someone else it says where you are right now is god's place for you live and obey and love and believe right ther
