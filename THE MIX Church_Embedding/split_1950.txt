ndle myself today i want to let you know that god has not given less to you god has just made the statement that i'm not going to give you more until you learn how to manage what you have somebody's trying to figure out what do i have i can walk up and and talk to a couple and say okay tell me what's your expenses and what's your income and then tell me what you have left over um so what you want me to do is like add it all up uh yeah how do you know what you're spending if you don't know what you have god is saying i'm trying to teach you principles so that you stop getting frustrated in your devotion and in your prayer time because you're asking me for things dude that do not manifest and the lack of manifestation is not because i don't hear you it's because you have not taken time to hear me that what you already have is enough for you to manage and until you learn how to manage more i can't answer the prayer that you're praying your prayers aren't broken it's your management skills that need help if i learn how to manage properly god can what hear and answer my prayer i don't want you to stop praying and getting frustrated because you believe god is on you're not on your side what i want you to understand is that god is on your side that god wants the best for you that he's called you to be more than a conqueror that he has greater for you that he has blessings beyond what you can imagine or think but i cannot partake in that that which has already been declared in heaven and to produce on earth if i don't know how to manage can i tell you that the reason we don't like
