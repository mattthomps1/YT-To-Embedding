hing to release something it's going to require you to sacrifice something it's going to require you to dig a little deeper it's gonna require you to sacrifice your pride it's gonna require you to sacrifice how much you think you are it's gonna require you to sacrifice that even though i got some money i'm still jacked up broken messed up in my head got past issues i haven't got over healing that i haven't gotten through that's what it'll do it says don't worry about fixing anything else in your life just keep pursuing me and i'll fix it all with what you can buy and the problem is is you've got everything you want but the problem is you're still broken five bedrooms broken two cars broken [Music] and you keep figuring out what else can i do where else can i invest what else can i put into that's going to get me to the place i need to go to and god says you will never be satisfied because the problem is is that you don't understand your purpose and your purpose is unlocked through the one who gave it to you and the only way you unlock purpose is through the creator but the only way to get clarity and what the creator says is to hear from the creator how do i hear from the creator the bible says the only person that has an access to the mind of god is the holy spirit [Applause] that's why it makes it hard when you come to me to say god has said something but the problem is you haven't been in connection with the holy spirit how did god tell you if there's no spirit to confirm what the spirit of god is saying because the bible says the only person who knows the heart and mind
