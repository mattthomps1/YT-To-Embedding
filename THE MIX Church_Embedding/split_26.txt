who touched my clothes but Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it no I'm sorry I skipped this the disciple speaker that's why it pays to have Insight I mean you don't have Insight you say anything they answering the question too quick given their opinion so fast not not not even pausing for a minute to see what may be happening and spoke right up you see the people around if you see the people uh crowding against you his disciples answered and yet you ask you can ask who touched me all these people around here and you ask who touched me they own you and you ask who touched me but Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it then the woman knowing what had happened to her came and fell at his feet and trembling with fear told him the whole truth and his answer he said to her daughter your faith has healed you go in peace and be free from your suffering can you say Amen to the word let it just rest for a minute he called our daughter that's a personal kind of familiar kind of uh name a greeting that you would say to someone you would say daughter other than that if you're very impersonal and you don't know somebody who said I miss right or sir or something like that but he answered her he said daughter that meant she was in the family he had pulled her in close he knew what had happened in a moment in a crowd where it was chaos this morning I want to take you to three four things that faith will do because she operated in faith and if you want the good life you're going to have to operate and faith there are no ifs ands buts about it there's no other way around
