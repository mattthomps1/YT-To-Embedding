re's no purpose then what's the plan and if there's no plan then what am i doing and the bible lets us know that jesus understood for all of his years of being on earth which we assumed to be about 33 he had purpose from beginning to end the bible lets us know that jesus he's hanging with his friends if you read in preceding verses they've come out of supper jesus has walked with them and he's taken three of his disciples into the garden of gethsemane jesus knows that the time is coming the bible is explaining that he's he's been talking about it and he gets into this moment with with his friends and and these disciples and he's teaching them and they're like rabbi we we love you and he goes into the garden to pray because there's something about knowing when you're entering into a different season of your destiny that their harder seasons there are than there are before and the bible says jesus is praying praying so hard that it looks like drops of blood sweat is coming out of him can you imagine praying so hard that you start bleeding all i know is if i start bleeding while i'm praying jesus better answer because this is some hard prayer i better hear something lord or i'ma make up something the bible says that he is there because he is torn between his assignment and how he feels can i tell you oftentimes you'll be torn between your assignment and what you feel you'll be torn between your assignment and what you want to do you'll be torn between your assignment and how you want to live in the moment and cannot tell you there's a sacrifice that has to be given it in order
