[Music] all right let's get into the word of god matthew chapter nine and we're going to start at verse 27 i sort of want to read a short version of this scripture because there's a lot that happens in matthew chapter 9 but i believe that god wants to speak something well something encouraging something to build our hearts for what is to come this year and we're going to go from verse 27 to verse 31 and it starts and it says and as jesus passed on from there where is there there is galilee as he was moving about in matthew chapter nine healing and uh speaking life into people calling of his disciples it it says that on from there two blind men followed him crying aloud have mercy on us son of david it said when he entered the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them this is something to underline jesus said to them do you believe that i am able to do this do you believe that i am able to do this they said to him yes lord and it says then he touched their eyes saying according to your faith according to your faith be it done to you and their eyes were opened and jesus sternly warned them see that no one knows about it somebody say but but they went away and spread his fame through all that district i want to come from a topic this morning that i want to speak on it is change what you see change what you see let's pray father in the name of jesus we are praying in this moment by the power of your presence your holy spirit that you would allow for us to change the way we are seeing ourselves the way we see you and the way that we see our destiny for we love you w
