you're creative for next you got to sow something now here's a problem with now sewing now sewing doesn't show Harvest anybody ready for a blessing now I could pull the musicians right out and we could just shout this thing down like God's gonna give you a blessing now and we and you'll be like yeah he gonna give it he's gonna get and I'll just be like wait real quick did you sow anything because it'd be real good to shout you up as long as you sow I can I can take you there if you got a seat but without a seed I can't get you a harvest because there's nothing for a seed to happen time to happen and then a harvest to happen and I need all three of those things for you to see the blessings of God because just shouting enough that your feet get to move it's not enough and just working hard is not enough because there's some things that God has for you that is pre-existing the ability for you to create it yourself God has some things in your life that you can't even work out through your job and your race some of you are actually limited by your job and by your race because you believe it's the Pinnacle of where you can get to and God says there are things that I have for your life that are so much greater than what you could ever imagine I actually have some things where you probably will work Less hours and make more money and you could be a better blessing and do better things but the problem is you become a little bit afraid because you're used to the pattern of making your own way and doing it your own style and you look at other people and say how are you out in the midd
