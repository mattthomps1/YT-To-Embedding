my love will overcome all of your mess your brokenness your misunderstandings and what i'm declaring today through the cross is that i believe in you now before you're even born i believe in you now before you're even moving into your destiny that god was willing to gamble on you before you even got here and all he is doing is waiting for you to walk in the middle of that deliverance for the bible says as they begin to cross the red sea he hardened pharaoh's heart so that they would chase them in and here's what i'm saying to you whatever you are fearing to walk into god is saying i want to let you know today as you walk through it the enemy is still going to chase you but don't you worry about it because there's victory on the other side [Music] god will be glorified through your triumph god will be glorified through the moments of pain for the bible even lets us know for those who've lost he says you you shall be comforted when you mourn blessed are the can i tell you today there is no hurt that there is not a victory on the other side when you keep going can i tell you today that whatever it is that's holding you where you are can i tell you whatever today that you made the decision that i'm just going to park it right here and not move any forward i want to say to you today there is victory on the other side stop looking at the enemy behind because he does come to steal and kill and destroy and he is coming like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but i just tend to think there's a possibility that god looked at you and said have you considered my servant have you
