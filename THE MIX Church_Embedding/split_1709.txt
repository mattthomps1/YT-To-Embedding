 that you're actually in disobedience because you're not where god says you're supposed to be what you've obtained is not meaning that you are in alignment with god it means that you had goals that you were consistent enough to go after that made a difference for you but the problem is is that you can't really move forward unless you understand where god says to move to the bible says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path if you haven't gotten direction then the path that you're on is probably a path of yourself and so today god is saying i want to give you direction in everything that you're supposed to do so that you can get to everywhere you're supposed to be when i release you then you'll understand there's victory behind it my question is is what is the red sea that's in front of you that you're unwilling to cross because you're so acquainted with your pain of your past that you don't mind going back why doesn't your past scare you more than your future the idea that i haven't reached to where god has called for me to do that scares me how far i could possibly be from my purpose that scares me how far i could possibly be from god saying well done thy good and faithful servant that scares me my last point that i want to give to you is point number three which is god wants the enemy to see your deliverance can i can i tell somebody in here that the cross was a gamble on you [Music] the cross said i'm going to put up this blood before i even see the results and i'm going to put my life out because i believe in accordance to how much i love you that
