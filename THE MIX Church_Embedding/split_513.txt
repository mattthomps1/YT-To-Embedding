r will believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life but there's one thing to say it and write it there's another thing to live it and as we jump into the scripture we're in Luke chapter 23 and we have the testimony of Luke that he is giving as in a recount as he's done research about what happened on the day that Jesus went to the cross he gives us an account that helps us to understand what Jesus went through and when we started verse 20 verse 33 it says this and when they came to the place that is called the skull it says There They Crucified him and the criminals one on his right and one on his left and Jesus said father forgive them I gotta let you know what's happened Jesus has been arrested he has been tried unfairly he's been deserted by all of his friends he's been denied by one of the closest people in a circle he has been beaten he has been whooped he has been hit he has been cursed at and he has been sentenced to death unfairly Jesus now with a cross on his back and a crown of thorns on his head bleeding hurting he walks to a place called the skull which is known as Golgotha and on this hill Jesus's to be crucified as they set him up to be crucified and they hang this cross the Bible says that the words that come out of his mouth is not how could you it's not I hate this is not this is the worst thing ever but what he says in the middle of his pain his father forgive them for they know not what they do it says and they cast lots to divide his garments and the people stood by watching but the rulers scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himse
