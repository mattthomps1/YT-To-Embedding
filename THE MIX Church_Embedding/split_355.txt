put a lab coat on me I'm a doctor well then if I'm a doctor it means I can operate this is a game from my past time called operation I don't know if you remember it but it was a good one and the jingle behind it was Operation you're the doctor and the problem if I can be honest is that in having a renewed mind many of us find ourselves in the place where we think that we have the ability to change guide spiritually and give adequate thought through our limited understanding of what God wants to do to change who we are on the inside and so we start self-medicating and we start self-improving to get ourselves to where we want to be and we become somebody say a doctor and we start getting ourselves in place where we're finding ourselves operating on things we have no Clarity on we don't know God's word we don't read God's word we don't study God's word we go to things that give us quick references with no background no understanding no Clarity and huge point no Holy Spirit and we get to operate I can change your life in 30 seconds if you can change my life in 30 seconds you're greater than God we need to be given to you and so we start at life anybody know this 2023 I got this I'm about to do this all I got to do is change my thinking and I am on my way excuse me excuse me okay hold on wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute no I got this I can change my heart because I don't even care no more you know what I mean I don't even care no more because this thing is about me I'm about to get my life right I'm about to get myself together my finance is about to be crazy it went ok
