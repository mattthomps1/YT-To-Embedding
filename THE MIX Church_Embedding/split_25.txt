where there's a miracle they may not grasshole of how honest you are true you are but if you can work a miracle you got my attention where when and so he had been doing these Miracles and he was coming off of the boat and in Capernaum and he the people had heard he was there so the word got out quickly and they came and they the scripture speaks about how they were crowded around him it was even hard for him to even move and he was on his way actually to Jerry's house who was a ruler of the synagogue because her his daughter was sick and he asked him will you come and heal my daughter and Jesus said yes I'll I'll heal her and he said and he was on his way he was going this way and this is where the scripture brings us this morning and Mark the fifth chapter and it says in verse 25 and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had yet instead of getting better she grew worse when she heard about Jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak because she thought if I just touch his clothes I will be healed immediately the scripture says her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was free from her suffering I have to stop there it didn't say she saw the blood stop it said immediately she felt the bloodstock in her body and she felt in her body that she was free from her suffering this God at once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him and he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my clothes can I say it real quick Faith touch
