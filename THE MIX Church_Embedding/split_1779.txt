 what glory you got to write that down why is that important because you will stop looking at what you do and start looking at who created you and you'll stop focusing on what i do as being the focal point and you'll start saying who created me what do you have me to do somebody say now because purpose is about fulfilling the now not about fulfilling the 10 years the purpose is the entirety of your life not the peace of your life you're not climaxing to a moment you are all about feeling the moment god has for you now now it's important that you understand that that christ is the creator because if you don't then you don't understand that he's spoken those things into existence before they even were john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god that same god is in the beginning of genesis genesis 1 and 3 says and god said let there be light i want to let you know that today god has spoken into existence the question is will you fulfill the destiny that he's spoken or are you fulfilling someone else's the question today is what are you trying to get that's not for you where are you trying to be that's not for you what are you trying to get to that's not for you but if you took the time to find out what was yours you will be fulfilled no matter where you are here's the thing money and the lack of is not the product that you are in your purpose right because the defining part that you'll think is that i'm doing well and better than the rest of the world because i've acquired and acquiring isn't god's destiny it's a part of god's blessin
