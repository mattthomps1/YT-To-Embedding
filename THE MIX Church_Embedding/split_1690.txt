dmit where it is in mark chapter 9 the father said to jesus he said if you can [Music] you heal my son jesus said if i can he said i can do anything where's your faith he said lord i believe but help my unbelief i walked into a a place with some people and i knew it i knew it was something that god was doing i just didn't know what he was doing and so instead of fronting like i had it all together spiritually i walked in and said there's some unbelief in this moment will you help me one thing i learned from the bible is jesus never left his disciples because of their areas of unbelief if you find out any time when there was a storm on the boat and the boat was rocking and they said jesus we're going to perish and jesus came up and spoke to the winds and the waves and he said peace be still he didn't leave him he just said oh you a little faith did he still do it that's that's that's the part you're worrying about how clean you looking good you look as a christian my question is did he still do it did he still honor the request jesus is walking out on the water the disciples are further along in the sea it's the middle of the night jesus starts walking on the water he scares the daylights out of his disciples when peter understands it's jesus he says lord if it's you bid me to come do you not know that jesus already knew that peter had doubt on the inside of him yet peter still walked on water and jesus honored the request what if jesus still honored the request in spite of your unbelief [Music] what if what if you could be honest and just be like i believe but help the area
