e hopefully speaking to the person that you're in tension with and so you're putting on a select group of songs that speak to the way you feel now about who they are finding the song that says i can do this by myself you just looking for anything to be able to give you a little bit of clarity about how you feel in this moment without saying it directly i'm gonna be honest that's where i was i had the tendency to look at the moment we had gotten so angry and so frustrated and so young that i was looking at my ring i said i can't this is i can't do this god's so angry i'm going to tell you how i'm living my life y'all passed the vast ambassador had a little he had a little issue back in the day and and i said you know what and i and i put my ring in my pockets don't do that don't judge me i i don't need your collective judgment this place is like planet fitness no judgment zone so i share my heart with you i take my ring off and i put it in my pocket the problem is is that i don't have deep pockets and i didn't think about that at the time we stop at the gas station and we get gas and i don't have my ring on but about midway i i get the gas said get back in the car and in midway in the travel you eventually find out you've got to talk and so we start talking and life starts to get back to a normal place but the problem is is when you make decisions in your feelings you can suffer the consequences in your moments when things have gone back to the way they're supposed to be and you find out that your decision in the heat of the moment isn't what was best for the future to come
