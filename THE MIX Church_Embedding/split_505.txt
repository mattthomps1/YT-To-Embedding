re of how many times you and I messed up we will find ourselves in a place that we would be in a negative in a deficit not understanding that God has been gracious enough to us he does not reward us he does not deal with us according to our transgressions and sins he does not deal with us according to our mess-ups he does not deal with us according to the way we think in our mind in the way that we treat our body and the way that we talk to people what comes in our mouth he is a gracious and a healing God do I have any people that have a mindset and a different way of thinking and a different way of living that says God if he's willing to forgive me I'm willing to forgive others if he's willing to see me right where I am I'm willing to see others right where they are do I have any Perfect People willing to love other imperfect people I believe today as a church as a mix of people coming together to change lives and change the world the only way we can do that is walk into a church and say literally this church is imperfect because I'm in here myself I stopped looking for everyone else to blame I stopped looking for individuals to find that mess up things and I start seeing me I start seeing what part can I play how can I make this happen what difference can I make and I'm seeing it today for giving people understand imperfect people and perfect people that don't get it all right and perfect people that don't always clarify what they mean and Perfect People and I will say to you they never did anything wrong can I be honest Jesus said it's easy to love those who love you but
