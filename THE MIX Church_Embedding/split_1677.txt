aan and the bible lets us know that they get to this place where they're recognizing that they're they're right there they're they're they're right where they're supposed to be and and the bible lets us know that moses sends out the 12 spies and he and he says to them i want you to go spy out the land go spy out your purpose sometimes you're in places that you feel uncomfortable about because you're spying out what god has for you in the future i don't know if somebody even caught that the reason why you should catch that really well is because you feel awkward where you are because it's not your current location it's where you're going to get to so when you enter into a new space stop seeing the newness of it as a sign of i don't need that because oftentimes god has you to go into areas that you've never been in before because you're spying out your destiny sometimes you're spying out the very place that god will take you to sometimes you're spying out the very position that god has for you sometimes you're spying out the very things that you never thought would be yours god is saying i want you to go take a look at it i freed you from some things but now i want to put you in an awkward place god this could never be me i could never walk in that place that could never be how i'm doing it and god is saying i need you to go spy out the land because there are some things i need for you to see yes you don't see yourself doing it right now yes you don't see yourself having the resource but i want to let you know god is already showing you what he has for you your hope is not in
