 Peter ran over he could say hey Peter I just want to go over the instance what happened to you when you left what happened when we got to the high priest's home and they asked you don't you know him aren't you with him and you denied me what happened I want to speak to some of us today who are so bent on the details that it keeps us from seeing the purpose that God has I want you to understand that God is calling for you to be healed not for you to be correct or informed it's calling for healing to take place in your mind your body and your soul Peter was willing to forgive and receive forgiveness what's a part of his apostleship now Jesus could change him see here here's the thing Jesus can't change you when your heart is hard he can't change you when there's for no forgiveness inside of you he cannot change you when you're not at a place of humility now Jesus could talk to Peter when he told Peter I will tell you what to eat when it's time for you to eat it he says in the next thing go to cornelius's house wait wait Jesus is Cornelius not a Jew it's like wait wait I don't I don't go to Gentiles houses I don't I don't meet people that are not like me I don't do things that are not like your will I don't find myself in the place where I'm meeting other people who don't think like I Think Jesus says in order for you to do my will and to do my work you have to go through what it is to forgive and be forgiven I think it's something special to the fact that Peter In This Moment has found himself at a place where he's humble before the mighty hand of God and he says do you love
