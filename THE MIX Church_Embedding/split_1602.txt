 where you are and some of us have planted our feet so well in our religion that we don't have that much a relationship can i speak this to somebody in here today just because it's working out doesn't mean it's supposed to work for you anybody ever been there before where something came with instructions you put it together but then it lost a component and you tried to find a replacement that didn't go with the actual set of what you had but it held it together just enough so that you could still operate it some of us are using spare parts spare pieces of our life that we have gotten so good at that we've put it into place of where our lives are currently that the way we're operating is that it's good enough to hold it together but it's not what god intended for our life so some of us are operating out of some places that no longer need to be put together we need to summon tell somebody real quick you just got to let it go there's some areas in your life where you got to let it go you pastor it still works there's nothing wrong with it the problem is is that there's something wrong with it because it's not yours and you're living a placeholder life with a prepared destiny that's already set out for you i'm here today to let you know is that god has something destined for your life can i tell you this if you are still breathing today you should be asking god what do you have for my life god is not here to keep you on earth so that you do not have to suffer the pain of losing your life he is not here so that you are just occupying the space because everybody around you needs
