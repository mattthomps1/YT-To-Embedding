e pumpkin patch come on now there's nothing like the pumpkin patch to pick out a pumpkin for the children who can't use the knife so they can't carve it out which means the working responsibility is on me as the parent so basically i'm going to pick my own pumpkin so that i can carve it out so that i can place it where it needs to be placed because my child does not have the ability to do that of themselves we get on the trip and we get into the pumpkin patch and we begin to walk in everybody knows the pumpkin patch is wonderful i planned though wrongly because i put in on an outfit thinking i was hanging out with a group of adults the problem was i was not and so the shoes that i wore as i walked in the muddy ground or oven to the pumpkin patch sends me into a place where they open the gates and there are children running array behind me in front of me all around me as all the little children of the world red and yellow black and white they are precious in his sights to me they weren't at the moment i just wanted to get through and looking at what was available i said to my daughter oh you want to go do something fun she said yes i begin to walk her to what was a cow a calf that was sitting in a barn and the option that she had was to be able to go milk the cow to me that sounds like an experience let's go let's have fun let's be a part of enjoying all of this moment because according to me it's not happening again i get in a place we get up to it i say sweetheart hey you want to milk the cow she looks at me as if i have lost all of my mind and says to me ill no in all of
