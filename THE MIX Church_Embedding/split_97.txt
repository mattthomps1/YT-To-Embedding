rpose that God has said over your life is that you cannot fulfill what God's calling you to fulfill by thinking the way that you've been thinking some of us are getting the same results that we've been getting all this time in our life because we trust and think that we have the solution but I'm crazy enough to think today that if somebody in here could change their perspective and understand that God's plan is better than your oh can you tell God's plan is better than your plan no no I think you you think it's happened half it's not half and half it's not 50 50. God's plan is better than your plan you need to tell somebody that real quick God's plan is better than your plan they're going to snap their finger at you and they're gonna roll their eyes and so you say guess what I'll tell somebody else tell your second choice God's plan is better than your plan I don't care if you smack your mouth I'll go to my third choice third choice God's plan is better than my plan you need to understand that that God's plan is better than my plan whatever I had in store I need to be able to trust God because his plan is better did my plan and point number three I need you to understand that God's love is unending it don't it don't matter what other people say God's love is on ending y'all know we we got restrictions on love these days love looks according into the way in which I receive it [Music] so it's like love is like I'll give you as much love as you get back to me you love me I love you you love me a whole lot I love you a whole lot you love me a little bit I love you a little bit
