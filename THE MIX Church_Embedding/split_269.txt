[Music] thank you so we're going to talk a little bit about relationships relationships anybody know that relationships can be tricky anybody know if you want to be honest relationships can be great and relationships can be stressful relationships can be something to brag about and relationships can be something to cry about can I get an amen right there there's something just unique about the idea of two people coming together who are different who are unique in their understanding their way of life the way they've grown up the way that they have done life together and and they're uniquely coming together to try to fit themselves at a place where they can really understand each other and communicate well but there has been this notion that there's even been books written about the uh Men Are from Mars and women are from Venus meaning that there is such a complexity in the way in which that men and women understand one another that it doesn't seem to just come naturally if you be honest many of you would would see that is this is a complex issue if I could just understand men if I could just understand women life would be much better but I'm here today to let you know is that I'm not sure that you will ever understand but you will come to a place where you can begin to move and operate in a way that can be conducive for the situation that you are in I want to let you know today that I think there's something special about understanding how God has formed and created and put us together informed us as Psalms lets us know in our mother's womb but he even before we got there h
