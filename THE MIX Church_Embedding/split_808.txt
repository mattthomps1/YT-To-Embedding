e me all right you know you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood what is going on here there's no humility jesus says i know who i am because the father has given me purpose stop apologizing for purpose stop allowing people to make you feel bad because you have direction i see it all the time somebody won't make you feel bad because you got a standard that you want to live by in your life but they don't have that same standard so they call you being dramatic you know you over doing it you know you're doing a lot you know you can use a lot right now no i was made for this i'm sorry you don't understand your standard yet because you haven't been connected to the father that gives you direction about where you're going so you'll settle for whatever you get whoever offers it whenever they want to offer it forgive me and when they give me the job you understand what i'm saying and i reject it why'd you reject it oh that job's not for me i was made for something else [Music] now don't you non-knowing purpose people try that cause you're gonna need that job you ain't got the faith to be rejecting jobs at the moment but when you know who god says you are you know where to walk in hey so i'm really not qualified for this but i honestly know god given me that job so listen i'm gonna put my application here i'm just gonna slide it on to you when you're ready you call me all right [Applause] we don't know the difference between false humility and the confirmation of what god has spoken and so we revel in the place of saying no no no not me well you should be saying yes yes yes that's
