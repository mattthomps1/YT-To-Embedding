t you to get today is that you need the church you need it more than when you show up on sunday you need the church more than when you attend for that service you need the church because the church is the place in which ambassadors of god's kingdom have taken the responsibility of giving you the clarity about what it is to be a citizen of the kingdom of heaven and if you don't know your rights and if you don't understand your position then you will give up the blessings that god has declared for you because while you are a citizen you are a citizen who doesn't know their rights and if you don't know your rights you don't know what to ask for the bible tells us that we can come before him that we can come directly to him that we can seek him in the midnight hour that we can ask of him when all things are broken apart that we can seek after his will and after his face but i don't know that and so what i do is i call my friend on the late night hour who cannot help me who is slumbering off of their own worries and their own disagreements and their own brokenness and spaces and i'm trying to get a concealed understanding from them but he says you're supposed to call on me because you've called on me he says i'll answer if you seek me you'll find me if you knock the door shall open but if i don't understand it then i'm always negating the process of what he wants to do in my life that when my marriage is not the way that i want it to be i can call on him in a small whisper and the bible says he knows the words that i cannot even utter he understands my heart when tears are runni
