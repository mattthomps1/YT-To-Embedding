o trying to work up the old you that through salvation jesus christ has promised that there is a new you that is coming forth but everything that the enemy tries to do is to keep the new you from coming forth so you get attached to being in jesus but staying old and you stay a convert and not a follower so many of us have found ourselves in lives where we settle for christianity but we don't settle and give ourselves an opportunity for relationship we know of god we just don't know god we know about him because we read the bible before but we don't really know him we haven't had experience with him we haven't delved enough into this relationship that we have received the gifts that are already expressed and given to us through the power of jesus christ the bible says and when they were baptized and when they were saved and when they move forward the bible says there is the gift of the holy spirit that is already available to every person but we stop at a convert space because we're scared of the transformation that has to happen inwardly because it's a spiritual transformation and we rather do an outward transformation because we're more in control of changing our actions than changing our hearts and we love the idea that if i could stop this and do that and bring about a complacent thought that as long as i'm not doing then i'm not in that place but the problem is because the enemy distracts so well he reminds you often that that place that has not been healed is still triggering on the inside of you you know how it works when you own 695 and traffic is going a little bit
