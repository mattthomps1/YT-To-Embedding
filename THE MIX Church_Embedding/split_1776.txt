alone we're so used to celebrating with a crowd that we think when no one's around that it's not a great time to celebrate but the problem is is that most of the time when you're getting to where god's called for you to be it's a time for you to celebrate because you're by yourself here's the reason you're by yourself no one really thought you gonna get there nobody thought y'all were gonna make it 58 years it gets quiet when when when you when you've been married for a long time and everybody was talking about y'all in the beginning and it was talking it looked a little shaky then i i don't know about that when they don't got it all together and you see it happen and you look years later and you look around you and it seems like everyone else has fled can can i tell you there are some things that god has called you to that you feel lonely and loneliness doesn't equal to disappointment there are things that god is doing in your life that you're by yourself in that he's trying to work through you because if he has to work through the people through you he'll never get to you there's some isolation moments that god is calling you to because he needs to get your ear not the ear of your influencers and god is speaking that because he's trying to fulfill destiny that's on the inside of you the problem is is that we're trying to do destiny with the group and god hasn't called you to destiny's child this is not this is not a group performance in your life god didn't call you to a trio just tell your neighbor say your destiny is yours your destiny is yours it's not the groups it's
