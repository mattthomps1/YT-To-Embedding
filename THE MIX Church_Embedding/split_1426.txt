re was something about the set of circumstances that peter was in that made him fearful i tend to think it wasn't just the winner but it was the condition and the violence of what he was feeling from the wind he didn't see the winner but he felt it and the enemy is here trying to be like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and some of us are scared of not what we see but what we feel says peter saw the wind says as he ceases when he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me it doesn't matter what you're in it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter how far you've gotten out there i just want to let you know anytime you can call on the name of the lord the bible says the lord saved them and jesus immediately somebody say immediately if you call on the lord he'll immediately reach out if you call on the lord he'll immediately step into your set of circumstances if you call on the name of the lord he'll immediately grab you out of that broken place if you call on the name of the lord he'll take you out of that temptation sometimes in the midst of when you don't know what to do and all your emotions and feelings are stirred up sometimes you just need to call on the name of jesus you need to yell out jesus save me i can't help myself in this moment i don't have enough strength to overcome this temptation i don't have enough strength to overcome this moment i don't have enough shift to overcome this brokenness sometimes you just got to yell out jesus save me right now where i am i don't know if i'm in my right state of mind but i need jesus to do
