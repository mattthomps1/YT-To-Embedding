happens finances become the biggest issue in the relationship here's why it's a brokenness because you can't speak intelligently to it because you don't know what you have because you're guessing because there's work in management so you keep praying for blessings so you don't have to manage what you have managing what you have would make you take a look at yourself if you looked at yourself you would see your spending more than you have in your bank account it would make you be accountable to what you're supposed to do and make cuts and since you don't like making sacrifices god says i'll keep it back from you and i can't multiply that in which you don't have an understanding of that's just a real quick moment for somebody who's praying for a breakthrough your breakthrough financially comes from you knowing what you have can i speak that to somebody today can i speak that over your life can i can i tell you the business that you're trying to open up is going to require you to do some research so that you understand so when the money does come in you know where it's going and god doesn't waste on you because the bible says at the end of this they scoop up all of the scraps and leftovers and they make 12 bags of it because it's going to be used for later god is not in the blessing business of giving it to people who waste because they don't know what they have it's not that your prayer doesn't work it's that your work doesn't work your work isn't working because your work isn't working you don't know how to apply it to where you should be going i want greater how are you goi
