 i hope everybody is well and the bible lets us know that as jesus was in the area it says mary and martha they knew jesus was around and when mary and martha knew that jesus was around the bible says martha moved it says she went to him that's good you got to hold on to that because even when it seems all is lost when jesus is in the presence of his people there's always something he can do that's supernatural we said it exceeding abundantly above all that you could ask or think they just wanted them to save lazarus from being dead jesus said i'm going to do something better i'm going to raise him can i speak to somebody that something's dead in your life and you've given up on it and you moved to a new promise but god said i haven't even resurrected the promise that i had before and you're trying to move ahead because it's taken too long for you to get where you are but jesus is saying today that promise that i still spoke to you we can't move to the next promise until we fulfill this one because your promises are in order according to your level of maturity and you can't move to another level of promise without going through the process that is for the season that you're in tell your neighbor real quick you can't skip the process that's what messes us up we go all right lord this promise i don't want it right now let's go on to another promise and let's work that one out and god says no no we're going to stick with this promise and we're going to stick with this promise until you get it so that you can become who you're called to be because i won't move you any further i
