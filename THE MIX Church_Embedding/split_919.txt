 to be saved for we love you and honor you in jesus name come on somebody say amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much y'all y'all know what i do i love celebrating the people that make it happen here can you help me give it up for our dream team that's in the house come on y'all help me celebrate them can we talk a little bit today can we can we have an opportunity for you to tune in and and can we just have a moment of teaching that i think is going to be paramount to you understanding this gospel that jesus has given to us i really think it's important because what we're speaking to here is an event it is an event that is giving us an eyewitness account of why these men these men and and women included in the 120 that were in the upper room what what was the changing moment that happened in their life jesus told him as he ascended say in jerusalem therefore you'll see the holy spirit and you'll receive it and you'll be able to do great the bible says great exploits you'll be able to do great works within me but if we rewind the clock a little bit previous to this before the disciples were together there was an instance where jesus was letting them know he says i am going to die but i won't stay dead i will come back to life he says with all power in my hand this resurrection that begins to take place jesus says to them i need you to know i am the resurrection i am my life everything about me is what you needed and so if you could be honest if somebody in here told you i'm gonna die tomorrow but don't cry don't delete my instagram don't delete my facebook cause
