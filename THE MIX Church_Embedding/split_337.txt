ything we have because we're planning to be with him in the air that's what this is all about or you can find yourself on the other side and you can put your name and it's called the rejection of Birthright and says I whatever your name is hereby give out my Birthright for the pleasures of this world I have found myself to be exhausted desperate too exhausted desperate and distracted to receive my inheritance everything that God has for me climb [Music] I made a couple of these not just I just leave them right here [Music] but I signed one at my office [Music] and I got my Birthright and every promise that God gave to me I snatched it I said God everything that you have for me I wanted right now I want my I I don't care what the devil is trying to say I don't care what's trying to happen in the moment what I am declaring today is that everything that God has for me is already yes and amen you like Pastor why why would you only make 25. [Music] that makes no sense [Music] I said I'm not sure if anybody's hungry I don't know who wanted their Birthright and who didn't I'm not sure how urgent it was but I got mine's off the top sit right on my desk and here we go it wasn't because if you don't get a paper you don't have your Birthright I went to this church it did not mean my Birthright I'm not going back there again [Music] but the idea is that you got to be hungry and desperate for what God has for you you got to put that promise in God I want whatever it is you have for me and I'm declaring it not over just myself but I'm declaring it over my household and my family [Music]
