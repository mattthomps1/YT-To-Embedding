 how to look for it i know how to figure out where it's at but the problem of it is is i haven't learned how to give it and one of the first things that you must learn when you're loving you have to learn obedience you got to learn obedience over feelings if you're going to love you've got to love out of what god says not out of what you feel because i am going to tell you there are going to be times where you will be challenged with your feelings of love versus your choice of love and if you haven't made a decision there means there's an option available for you to love and not to love can i tell you because we change anybody know you change anybody look like they did when they were 15. y'all like i change right when we change we have to recognize that love isn't supposed to change with it when i was you know when we were together you had all that flowing hair now you cut it and i you know i just i don't know if i like it like i used to all you gotta do is turn around like love is a choice so you chose me short hair ball head long hair lock hair whichever one i decide to put on today whatever it is [Music] you chose to love me because in your choosing things change if you can only love me when i'm swole and i'm ripped and i'm wearing small extra small shirts i know fellas y'all know how you do you've been in the gym one day you in there with a baby gap shirt on talking about man i was just at the gym today ah man how could you not love this i want to tell you about it the obedience of it because it's so important because when we haven't learned to love we've put stress on
