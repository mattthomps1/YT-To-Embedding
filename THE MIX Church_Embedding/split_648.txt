ou spend your time is where you're going to find your return on investment your return on investment is going to be everything to which you give your life to whatever you spend your life doing is the very thing that you'll end up praising and worshiping over the God who gave you everything you already have my question today is what is your priorities the first thing you ought to do is refocus your priorities well Pastor why should I refocus my priorities because the Bible says the first thing that you should be seeking after is who God seek ye first what the kingdom of God what does that mean that means that when I switch citizenship from being in the kingdom of darkness to being in the Kingdom of Light what I needed to learn was how to live in a new kingdom if I don't know how to live in the New Kingdom then guess what I'll take Old Kingdom ways and bring them into a new kingdom mindset My Old Kingdom ways was I do it when I want I do it how I want I do it where I want and I do it for the reasons that I want to do it for the king of mindset says my priorities are given to me by God according to what he speaks and lays on my part if God says go I go if he says say this I say this if he says move I move but the problem is is my priorities are no longer his priorities my priorities are the things that I care about the most and God says have your priorities become your symbols of worship can I ask you today are you worshiping School more than you're worshiping the one who's taking you through it I gotta have that degree because once I get that degree everything's gonna change
