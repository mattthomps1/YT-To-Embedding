t there's you know i know we learned and grew up don't question god right we learned that david said why has you forsaken me that's a question jesus asked that claim kind of question on the cross that's a question god ain't scared of your questions he's he's big enough to answer your question and plus you ain't the first one that ever had it [Applause] and so what happens is the these songs are here and whatever your moment is you can sing one you can read one well today we're going to read psalms 103. i'm going to start with one through five it's on the screen it says bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your iniquities who heals all your diseases who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like eagles don't that feel good hey when you get home just read the whole thing like that you don't have to read as loud and as passionate as i just did do it how you do it you know just read it out loud but what happens is david is is talking to not an audience david is talking to himself i know i know you learned you're not supposed to talk to yourself but if you do then you at least don't answer yourself but david all throughout the psalms you start this you start to research and you try to see where the audience is and there is no audience david if you would he's in this mirror he's in his mirror and and if i could say anything to any leaders out here any
