my is always trying to make it reject what god says so i gotta live out daily victories when you come to church i just get excited because i feel like you got here and after the week you just had and after all the prayers you just gave up the fact that you even still made a decision to walk into the house of the lord and to give god the praise and honor and glory that is due unto his name i figure it'd be something that we celebrate the lord together why because i have a victory for today yesterday may not have been the victory that i thought i could have had but i'm letting you know today i get to start it all over the bible says brand new mercies every what morning i i'm just excited because i've got another opportunity it's early in the morning but the lord is with me it's early in the morning but he's got in my footsteps this is the right way to start it off this is the right way to operate this is what god has given me every sunday i come in thinking god this is a fresh start all over again you're going to give me a word for this week that'll bring me out i'm not going to fall like i did yesterday because i'm living out what daily victories daily will i seek you daily will i know you daily will i walk in your promises daily will i receive your blessing i'm praying every day let thy will be done all over as it is in heaven god everything you have for me i want a daily daily bread daily blessings daily miracles daily god doing work in me i'm here to let you know you can't take a break from what god is doing because the enemy is not taking a break from what he's doing the
