tand if he gives us too much it's going to flatten us out it'll shut us down we can't handle it and so Jesus was moving because he he knew that he had come to get his life so that Humanity could live he understood that he knew that was his purpose and as he came he was walking around telling people look I'm the way I'm the truth I'm the life I I am I came here that you could live and that you can live abundantly and I'm going to give my life because where we are now we are disjointed there is a separation between humanity and God and when I come I'm coming to give my life so I can pay the price for sin and I can make sure that we are back together in Fellowship in Union so Jesus was here but his ways were unconventional you know we can miss out on things because they're unconventional doesn't look like we were used to seeing it doesn't act like it used to see it's not what everybody else does and what everybody else did Jesus was totally unconventional he ate with sinners people that were robbing Tax Collectors prostitutes he was eaten with people that were broke down poor he he moved around in the way that the religious folk couldn't even handle and so he's talking in him and he comes and he says I'm here I'm coming to bind up the broken heart set the captive free and he says as he moves around the prophets had spoke about him and and they said that when when the Savior comes when the Messiah comes in the one that has come to save the world when he come we'll know it because he will do miracles he will and so he was he was performing miracles and you know people will come
