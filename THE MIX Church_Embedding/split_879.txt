fun is gone that's what it looked like why because you came to church and we was like let's just rejoice in the lord and the person besides you looks like they're two minutes from saying something to you that you don't like and you're trying to figure out are church people nice do they have any joy just tell your neighbor real quick i'm nice turn back to that neighbor and say i couldn't tell no i'm just playing don't do that don't do that i don't i don't want you to get into an issue with nobody but close relationship with god is not sunday sunday is the byproduct i come in his presence to be rejuvenated and renewed and to be together on one accord and one mindset i've come to be open my heart to be open and to worship god and to have an opportunity but what i am telling you is you were made to live in joy you were not made to live in anger bitterness unforgiveness is the root of the loss of joy some of us are so brokenhearted that we've never had the opportunity to receive the healing that god has for us so today i want to offer a relationship for you to get closer to god so that you don't stay where you are this idea of closer relationship is about intimacy it is not about proximity [Music] matthew chapter 7 verse 21-23 it says this not everyone [Music] who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will somebody say the will the will of my father who is in heaven many will say to me on that day lord lord did we not prophesy people love the gift part of what they do then we not prophesy in your name and in your name drop out demons
