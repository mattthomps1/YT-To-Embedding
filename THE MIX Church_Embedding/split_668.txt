 your present and can be the product of your future Jesus begins to speak and he begins to Proclaim and he begins to speak to the knowledge of what is to be and as I observe it Jesus sums it up and says you have been given insight into God's kingdom he tells the disciple I said Lord why do you keep talking in Parables you're you're talking about the person that sows it we sow on Rocky ground and we sow into thorns and we sow into these different areas and why do you keep talking to them about that and he says I have to make it simplistic I have to be able to share the story because they have not been open to the secrets of the Kingdom here's what I want to let you know the gospel oftentimes can become a hindrance to where you want to go because your spirit and your heart have not been opened up unto the secrets of the Kingdom there's something about being connected to the power of the holy spirit for the Bible lets us know that in order to know the mind of God you must be connected to the spirit of God the spirit word of God knows the mind of God and if the spirit of God knows the mind of God then I have to have the spirit to understand how to follow God you can't follow God thinking out of your good actions and your good ways it's not enough to be able to understand what God is saying for the Bible lets us know that his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts so when I think things are good God says it may be good but it's not purposeful so that's why I must be led by the spirit and not by The Good Will of my mind my thoughts or what I believe is right
