 Bible says every day of my life is written in his book it is not a surprise that you messed up last year God had already planned for all your mess ups so guess what you're still on course and I'm telling you today it it's your bell you're better than me but all the Bible says you need to do is wait on the Lord and be a good parents and he show us strengthen your heart why because waiting takes patience thank you [Applause] some of you the devil has been whispering in your ear you should be further than where you are [Applause] over this by now you shouldn't be dealing with this and what he begins to do is give you a perspective that you have the ability to get to where God has called for you to be by yourself and so you lack faith and you lack trust because you think you're smart you're Savvy I can work the system I know how to do this thing y'all I'm good if you can sit down with me I can change your life in five seconds here's the problem I can't change my own life in five seconds I doubt you can do it [Applause] see what we've got to learn is that when God is being glorified it's not a quick fix he is doing something in his timing because there is a purpose beyond the idea of fixing the situation it is that the process of the situation is turning to fix you and to make who he's called you to be to come into fruition so what you must understand is that what God is doing is on purpose it is not because he forgot about you it is not because he's late on hearing your prayer I want you doing these 21 days to know that every time you pray she hears you and he is putting toget
