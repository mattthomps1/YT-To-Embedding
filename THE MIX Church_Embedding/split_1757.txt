 you've got to change what you've done you know some of us hadn't seen nothing we hadn't seen a possible new us we hadn't seen a delivered us we hadn't seen and healed us we hadn't seen us in our right minds we hadn't seen us thinking and having a perspective the way that we have and so we have learned some things in this last year we have grown some ways in this last year we have put up with some things we would normally put up with in this last year we've forgiven some folk we would never have forgotten this last year and we find ourselves in a place looking at a different set of us can i tell you some of you have been pushing through and you're saying pastor i'm tired but here's what i'm saying last year you would have quit this year you seen a new you that won't quit so what i need you to know is that you seem too much to go back you seem too much to go back to where you are god is showing you too much for you to end up in the space you used to be god is connecting you the people that are telling you too much and trying to give you too much information and you're saying lord i don't even understand what they're saying he's saying what i'm doing is overloading you with vision and direction so you don't have an excuse to go back to what you used to i'm trying to tell you this why because there's something ringing in your heart when you try to go backwards that reminds you remember when pastor marcus said i've changed even though i didn't change i don't feel like it but he said god was doing something in me i know better now so i act differently now can i tell somebody in
