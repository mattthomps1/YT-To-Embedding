[Music] listen i am i'm speaking this over somebody today there is just no use in going back sometimes i believe in life where we find ourselves in a lost state at a place where uh we have certain sections of our lives together but the entirety of our lives or the completion of our lives are is not at a a full sustaining momentum we we find that good is happening over here but we're a little bit disrupted over in this area and we're just trying to find out how can i get back to the place that i need to be in life some of us are even trying to find a new set of steps a new route in which to walk in in life we are feeling a sense of unease of feeling a sense of loss of purpose or destiny we are feeling a sense that there is something missing in our lives it's not money it is not houses it is not cars it is not luxury things it is not even people but we understand that something in our hearts and in our spirits are missing i don't know if you've ever been there before but you've had everything you've wanted to have you've bought everything you've wanted to buy you've had every individual you can you you have the children you have the spouse you have everything that you've been praying for but yet there is still something that's missing on the inside of our lives and i don't know if you've ever walked in that place before but i want to let you know today that you're not alone in being in this moment and i think in the last two years many of us have been pondering and considering uh where we are in the current state of where life is who am i what am i doing where am i going how
