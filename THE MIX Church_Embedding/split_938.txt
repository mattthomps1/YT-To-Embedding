ther door anybody remember back in the day you probably got one but i used to have a screen door anybody remember a screen door on the house it's the door you look out of when you yell at people but you don't want to be close to him you know you open the door what do you want but there's a whole nother door right there you're pushing against it you're talking through the grid of it some of us while we've opened one door to god we've left the other door of our hearts shut i'll do church uh you know i'll try that 21 days thing and i'm here today to let you know it's more than a 21 day thing it's a belief that jesus jesus died and he rose and from that belief now i jump into this word now i open my heart to what he has to say because if not all of my skeptic ways all of my conspiracy theories all of my processes and my thoughts that make me doubt they'll take precedence over god's word can i tell you believing in the resurrection it all hinges on it it changes your eternity it gives you a newness of life and it impacts your world today i want to let you know you're a true world changer but today we've got to not grab the scriptures we've got to grab a hold of jesus and the bible says those scriptures are a testimony to who he is not a book to read about what he's done we're not reading a story we're testifying to a story [Music] this is what he did in me i just want you to take a moment and think about what has he done in you what's your testimony because your belief can't hinge on what you can understand your belief in jesus has to hinge on that you know he's the resurrected
