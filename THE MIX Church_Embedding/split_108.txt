xed church is not violent but just in case there's some people who are still praying and binding the spirit of anger please thank you for your patience I promise I came six hours to give you this verse 11 says then Jesus note let's jump let's jump let's jump to verse 9. he says he says that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gave us me I have lost none he says verse 10 said then Simon Peter having a sword in his hand he smoked the high priest servant and cut off his right ear in the servant's name was malcus see there are some people who are not spiritually equipped to handle Where You Are and they would do things in your life to cause you to forfeit your position cause you to question your identity cause you to question God because they don't have the oil the fire Pastor Marcus they don't have the fight they don't have the consecration some people don't have the discipline they don't have the favor to walk with you into this place where you are and where you're going and so Peter is trying to cut off something listen stop trying to pray every storm away scripture says that tribulation worketh patience if everybody that prays that's tied to you is always trying to pray you out of something and not through something you've got the wrong caliber of intercessors around you where you're going next Church you need people that can pray you through it's too cute I said you should praise God for the people that are coming that can pray ah can pray before I make my prayer point I said praise God for people that can pray pray pray can get a prayer through
