e seeded Pastor I told you again I don't have kids I'm not here to talk about the kids that you have I'm here to talk about the community that you could change you say you want change and you say it looks good my question is what is the seed of sacrifice that you're willing to follow God without having the directions of what's next I'm sorry to tell you about the Holy Spirit is not always Spirit it does not give you the end destination and everything in between when you want it you have to take this thing step by step Lord I've been seeking you and you gave me a step so what's next he says what if you seek me you'll do what find me so it requires me to go back to the throne of grace where I'm may be able to attain help in the time of need God I need you to direct me to the next step on what to do some of us think we've got it all wrapped up and all together our lives are already finished we know when we're going to retire we know where we're going to retire the problem is is you don't create your own legacy God creates your legacy God talks about what happens with the seed that you have [Applause] because the problem is is the sea doesn't know where it's going but I'll never forget when overseer Joy started pastoring and people started looking at me saying so you think you're a pastor I said absolutely not you have lost all of your mind why because as a seed I could not see for myself the fruit that I would bear it wasn't my responsibility to even see it it was just my responsibility to be what obedient some of you are asking God what's next and God is saying I'm not here t
