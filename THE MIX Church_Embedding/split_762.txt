irst began he had a trombone and and the trombone sat in the library of the church because the church had a library because i think people checked books out i don't know i don't i wasn't allowed in there but there was a trumpet on and it had a plaque on it i said ernest gilliam senior and here's what i know that trombone was up there as a memorial i don't think the trombone was up there because my grandfather was good at playing the trombone i think it was just up there to remember that he used to play the trombone and we like things to have a remembrance and so they put it up there and someone came into the church they didn't harm anybody but they stole the trump bone now i don't know what kind of person in the world walks into a church to steal one of the most complicated instruments to play in the world but they come in and they steal the trombone and immediate relief from that sister paul that day they tell us we're locking down the church every time we have a rehearsal we're locking down the church every time somebody wants to come to choir rehearsal we're locking down the church and if you want to come in you got to knock on the door church change and it became locked and the access to the church was not as easy as it used to be i think about that in context to the way the church is now where the church has found itself locked up so much that what we see from it isn't an easy access to get into the presence of god where we're requiring people to do a whole lot to enter into his presence and it's almost like what jesus went through is null and void because what he did
