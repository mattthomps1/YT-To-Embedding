i had to look to the side and somebody said he died he died he died he died he lost all function of his body he died and he was raised back to life it's a history here's why history is important because within with no history you'll go to your own history and your own history will be about you working it out and not god oftentimes people can get jealous of your faith because you've seen things and believe things that don't seem to line up with what they know the problem is is that i'm willing to trust god at different levels because i know of his history and his track record when we put ourselves in position that we don't build a relationship with god we don't give god the opportunity to do the supernatural in our life so when the supernatural is not performed in our life we don't have a history or a place to go to to say i'm willing to trust god out of the normal of what i know because i've seen him do it before the thing about 21 days of prayer and fasting is that you need a history with god and you need god to do something in the 21 days that will give you a history of who he is so that when times get hard and when you believe all is lost you have a history of your own of what god can do if you only believe in the past of what you put together you will never trust god enough to pray beyond what you could even do of yourself to know that god will do exceeding abundantly above all that you could ask or think that's why prayer isn't important to you because you have no history for god to be able to rely on what he's done so you're only relying on what you believe enough ins
