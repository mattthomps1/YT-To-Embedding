en i looked at the dates on my passport there was an expiration date now unlike some of us who tell you oftentimes that the expiration date don't mean nothing when it comes to food this expiration date meant something and this expiration date said after this moment you don't have the ability to be able to travel outside of the country without going through a renewal process in order to get your passport well i felt good because i said well you know there's a passport place in in washington dc and there's a passport place in philadelphia and and there's probably if i have to travel i'll travel to new york and in my citizenship as an american because americans are so confident in and how we move and that we can just get anything done i called the u.s passport agency and i said yeah i would like to schedule an appointment because i travel out of town in a week i said sir here's what i would like to let you know is that you can schedule but we don't have anything available i said to them well you don't understand the urgency of what i need to do i need to get out within a week i travel in six days so i need you to get me on the books they said you may want to get on the books but there is no space for you to get in the books as i looked i said lord you know how we do immediately lord i said now if you want me to go because i put the pressure back on him we read the scripture a couple of weeks ago that says come to jesus i couldn't complain to nobody else but god because only he could open this and say lord if it is for me to go i'll go if it's not then i got it it's okay listen
