ted for those of us that are in this place we are depressed sometimes for those of us that are in this place anxiety is kicking in for those of us that are in this place anger tends to take over for those of us that are in this place we slip and we mess up and that is why the cross is so important to us that's why he got up from the grave [Applause] he's covering all of our nests but if we could be a honest people we could be a transformed people but we're just sitting with attitudes in our hearts and emotional breakdowns and we're not taking our passport to jesus lord i need you to do my citizenship again cause i'm about to lay her out [Applause] [Music] and that's why living in the dual space can be so complicated because at times we're so used to our world citizenship that we haven't taken time to understand our kingdom citizenship and here's what i want to clarify for you is that sunday is not enough for you to understand your citizenship and your rights as a kingdom listen real quick the reason why some of us don't understand what to ask god for and how to understand the blessings that he has set over our life is because we don't understand the kingdom principles that bring about the kingdom movement so that we can reach after the things that the king has given us so we operate out of a church knowledge but not out of a spiritual movement and so we're in the world where the bible says we're not of the world which means that's why we have to learn as we love the lord god with all our heart all our soul all our mind and loving our neighbors as ourself we're seeking god t
