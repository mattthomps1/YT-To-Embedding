n where we are today and we haven't given ourselves permission to might say permission you haven't given yourself permission to go any further to envision any greater to see any greater than where you are because you're still stuck getting over that god got you out of the last thing and if you could see that god could do greater you would envision for greater because every greater is not dependent on the need the greater is dependent on what you can ask for if you can't ask for it you can't receive the bible says ask and you shall what receive seek and ye shall what find knock and what the door shall be open some of us are giving god our expectations in a context of acting like god should know god says i know but the problem is is you didn't activate my word and my word says you have to ask in order to what receive other than that we don't do any work in the process of asking which is an object of helping us to believe by faith and what god would do we're just expecting god to do anybody ever went up to a door ring or you've seen somebody at a ring and they don't knock on the door or ring the ring they just stand there expecting you to answer the door and they staring to the ring like i know you see me i know you see me right here come answer the door and you're like why didn't you what ring the doorbell because we think because we're in front or we're in god's presence that god has to answer because i'm what visible but the bible says no if you look according to his word he says when you ask it you shall receive it we're just standing in prayer like this i know you see me
