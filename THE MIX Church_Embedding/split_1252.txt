[Music] here's one thing i understand that the bible lets us know is that in genesis when the lord said it's not good that man should be alone he was not speaking to the reference of just marriage and relationships that were intimate he was talking about the presence of community there was something powerful in community community brings connection community brings correction community brings accountability community allows you the moment to see outside of yourself some of the things that you cannot perceive of yourself which gives you clarity and understanding that where i am is not where i used to be but where i am is not where i want to be and so community brings the accountability that says that i'm not just fine where i am but that god has more for me just tell your neighbor real quick god has more for you yeah yeah you may not have heard that this week you may not have heard someone say that to you in this life that you've been going through on this week but i just want to let you know that there is more for you and when you have the right people around you speaking the right things and clarity what they bring into an understanding is to say where you are isn't bad but i want to let you know where you're going is even better so we're grateful even if you try to put one or two three seats in the middle of you you're still around somebody somebody's got their eye on you you just tell your neighbor i got my eye on you good morning church good morning to those of you that are online welcome to the mix my name is marcus england and i'm the lead pastor here and i'm so grate
