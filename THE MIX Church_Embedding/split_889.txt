nt you to give it over to me so i can teach you who to be today god wants to make you brand new in him he didn't save you so that you could walk around and say i'm good he saved you so that you can serve today he's calling us to serve in ways more than we can imagine or think it's not about your gift it's about what's inside of you god has something great on the inside i want to pray over you i want to pray whatever's inside of you will come out of you and that you will see the full manifestation of the power and presence of god in your life and from that here's how you measure your follow i see my fruit [Music] i see others lives are changed i see people coming to know jesus i see people changing around me i'm a disciple that's bearing fruit today that's all we are that's what you see here at the mix when people gather together i just want to bear fruit i want others to know that jesus is the way and this is the kind of movement that we're leading here at the mix but we understand that the resident of resurrection of jesus christ is everything that our faith stands on that discipleship is the maturing of who we are as people pour into us as on shoppers aren't and as we pour into others and today that he saved us so that we can serve
