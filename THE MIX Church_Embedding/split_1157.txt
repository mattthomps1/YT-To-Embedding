 out of my life but i'm planted i won't give up i won't quit i won't lure away my purpose and my promise i'll stay planted in the word of god though he slayed me yet will i trust them though things look hard yet will i seek after him though things are turning up i tell you i won't move i'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of living water [Music] i'm gonna lose some but i'm telling you i'm planted some things are going to hurt but i'm planted [Music] one thing my family will see is a man of god planted he didn't move he didn't move it got hard but he didn't move he's planted [Applause] [Music] everything that the enemy will throw at us will confront him in our wilderness but what we won't do is choose to go back won't go back i won't go back to egypt i won't go back to bondage there is nothing in this life that is worth going back i shall be like a tree planted you can take my kicks you can take my car you can take my money but i'm planted because the bible says whatever he takes when i come out i'll be as gold i'll be more valuable than i was before i may not have what i used to have but i'll be better than i was before now god has placed me in such a place i don't even need those things to define me anymore because i'm coming out as pure gold i know the value of who i am [Music] since they won't fear drought their leaves will remain green i want to speak this over somebody's life today it says that they won't be stressed i told our huddle team today i said the bible lets us know that jesus says my yoke is easy and my burdens are light some of you are so stressed out b
