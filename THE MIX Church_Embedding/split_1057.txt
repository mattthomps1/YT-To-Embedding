ove thy neighbor as thyself anything that comes under that that does not work within that time frame lets me know it's out of the will of god so we deal with somebody say the tension you deal with the tension that i still want to follow jesus but i don't always agree with the concepts that are connected and i want to let you know today that the church is being bombarded so that malice is spoken against it it's so easy for everyone now to come together who never had agreement in the beginning because the idea is that if we can break this christian thing the enemy knows that he was already plotting see we only see just what cnn put up but the bible says that we're fighting against a spiritual thing the bible says we're not fighting flesh and blood but principalities and spiritual wickedness that is in what high places so what i must do is pray and seek god's face to understand spiritually what's happening in our nation so my mouth doesn't precede me in something that's not biblically accurate and what i don't do is just answer out of what i feel i understand i answer out of the tension because the tension is still there i want to tell you today there are some things that you will wrestle with until you see god and you've got to be okay with god i don't understand it but the inside of my heart as david said is lord search me and if you find anything that's not like you take that out when we're working with dual citizenship the idea is that you live in a world no the idea is that you live in a world that has to be dealt with with grace grace does not mean i drop standard grace
