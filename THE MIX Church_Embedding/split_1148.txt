thinking the way i need to be acting because the idea that i go behind is the context that all god wants to do is punish me and god says i'm just trying to get you to the what promise and that promise moving to the promotion of where i've called you to so you're saying well pastor how do i understand how do i bring to clarity the season that i'm in well i'm glad you asked the first thing we must do which sounds very cliche-ish if you've gone to church for a long time but it is you must seek god i want you to add this word at the end diligently because the hiccup that i get is because i prayed once last week that i'm expecting the promise of god to be fulfilled and scripture gives me clarity that there is a responsibility on my end in order for me to understand the season that i'm in scripture says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 it says for he who comes to god must believe that he is and somebody say anne and that he is a rewarder of those who what diligently seek him that's why you have to be careful when people give you a word from god but they're not diligent seekers because you will seek for a promise that's not yours listen you can do coffee shop talk with your girlfriends and your homies but when it comes to your purpose you need to find some folk in your life that are diligently seeking god so that they can be able to pour something back into you outside of what they feel and what they think it's the question have you been with god lately seek god the bible says diligently and he shall reward you so you don't have to make up promises you don't have to make up promotion
