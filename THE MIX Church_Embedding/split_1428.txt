asking god to do i'm just believing that the storm has to go its cycle and the bible says at the end of the storm at the end of people seeing you work through what you thought would kill you at the end of people seeing you walk out something they have never seen before to forgive the unforgivable to do the unbelievable to move and operate in the unexpected and operating in the exceeding and the abundantly and above all when people see you not run away from the storm not crouch down to the storm not beg the soul but you stand firm in the storm the bible says when people see it it says and this is what happened when they got back in the boat they worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god i want to let you know today you're still in the storm because people need to see you overcome sometimes you're in the storm because people need to see you break through they can't see god so they need to see you sometimes you're right in the middle you're saying god take me out but if he takes you out too early you don't get to get the audience for people to say my god he must be the son of god if he changed your life he must be the son of god if he changed your circumstances he must be god if he brought you out if he broke the addiction if he healed your body he must be the son of god so i want to preach from the topic today sometimes you got to step out to step in you got to step out of where you are to step into what god has for you to do and we're going to talk about that this morning can we pray father in the name of jesus help us to step out to step in amen god bless you thank
